com.calea.echo,Shaunna 7,"Love this app, it's very easy to use and personalize. My only complaint is since upgrading my phone the personalized notification tones for each user only work if mood is up on my screen at the time the text comes in. Edited 10/25/22-new update totally screwed up the app. If do don't allow the option to monitor phone calls you can't use the texting option. Looking for a new app. üòî",4
com.calea.echo,Tiffany Strodthoff,"March 2020- Loved it for quite a while. In the past 4 months its only gone down hill. Despite updates and attempts to diagnose issues, the help page doesn't exist anymore it still doesn't work as it should. Wanted to try and fix the problems but looks like I'll have to find a new app now Update 7/2021 continues to get worse. Wont send texts, while still receiving them, can't run diagnostic 10/2022 WORSE YET! Can't see anything in chat list. Have to manually look up a contact or read their msg!",1
com.calea.echo,Keith „ÄéTalos„Äè,"This has been my SMS app for years. I bought it and even recommended it to others. Unfortunately, I cannot to that any more. All the recent updates have each reduced the quality of the app further and further. It is sluggish, tries to show ads when it is paid, won't directly send pics from the camera, and now it won't even open. Unacceptable!",1
com.calea.echo,Autumn S,"I have used Mood for years and with several different devices. I've never minded that they had advertising on it, but this most recent update has made the advertisements huge, and it now massively lags and is halfway unusable. I even considered getting lifetime premium thinking that without the ads maybe it would work better. But I literally can't even get through the purchase premium page without it having an error and not being able to buy it. Now I have to find a new text app ):",2
com.calea.echo,Whitney Turpin,I have had mood for a couple of years now. And I had the premium service. Until you updated your app in 3/22.  And it kicked me off from the premium service.  And now I cannot get back on.  It says that there is a problem on your end every time I try. And NOW... you're update today has ads all over the pages.  Which I absolutely hate.  Which is why I paid for the premium service to begin with.  If the problem is on YOUR end you need to remove the ads until you FIX THINGS!!!,1
com.calea.echo,Wesley Cook (Caerdivon),"Every update there's something different for me to complain about. Previous update was issues with double notifications with the forced overlay (which was able to be fixed with an obscure setting). Now, with the most recent update the app lags *HARD* if its open for more than a few minutes, requiring me to restart the app after each text message to be able to comfortably send it without the application lagging behind my button presses by 1-2 seconds. This used to be a great app, what happened?",1
com.calea.echo,Jessica Gillette,"Had used this app for years until a couple of months ago when it became so glitchy and slow I was forced to get a new messaging app. You guys had something great and then ruined it with a bunch of massive ads that slowed the app down and glitch out. Too bad you won't learn from your mistakes (and no, I won't buy anything from you because it still won't work).",1
com.calea.echo,Annette Groseclose,"I loved using this app for years. However with the most recent update it's become a terrible nuance. It will not allow you to turn the bubble popup feature off, it freezes and locks up constantly and is super slow. I finally got rid of it. Wish they would have left it alone the new updates ruined the app.",1
com.calea.echo,Aaron White (Aaron),"I like the customizability but I am unable to upgrade to premium. I need the premium version for use with my Huawei GT2 Pro watch. Ergo, it's of no use to me. Because it's the only messaging app that works with the watch, the watch is less useful because of the app. Extremely frustrated. I spent 45 min trying to figure out how to give this company my $14.99. It could be an issue with my very normal Android phone but I highly doubt it. Now I need to send the watch back. So thanks a lot!!",2
com.calea.echo,Eric Mcdow,"I have been using more for a long time and have referred many of my associates. This last update is absolutely horrible! Sluggish, freezing, or just completely not responsive! In addition I paid for premium service that was taken away with this last update. I used to love mood. But at this point very disappointed. I hated the last update with all the overlays after calls and text!... just go back to the Original mood I was using 5 years ago and leave well enough alone please!",2
com.calea.echo,Lavelle Hall,1. After the most recent update text are taking way to long to go through and some are not sending at all. This is non-negotiable. 2. There are still a lot of blocked out emojis. 3.Now the app's notification isn't showing up on my watch when new text come in. This feature is the most essential part of having a smart watch. Not being able to receive notifications on my watch makes this app's rating a negative 1.,1
com.calea.echo,Serg Eguiarte,Update: Mood Customer service was fantastic in responding and found the issue was with my settings and not the app. Thank you! The app doesn't notify me of incoming messages. The sound alert is gone. What can I do to fix it? I've tried everything and I have the paid version.,5
com.calea.echo,Christina Goodnight,"I have been using this app a long time and am a premium user. I can't use this app anymore. It's excruciating slow and laggy, when I pull down on messages it slides over to contacts. I can't even type a message without it being so behind it's so slow. It freezes up. I won't be using this app until they fix it back to how it used to work.",1
com.calea.echo,Hillary Brown,"Used to be the best messaging app ever. Hands down. I even bought the premium. I still think this could be the best but I keep running into problems like two separate pop up notifications with no way to pick one or the other. This could probably be resolved easily enough, except that notifying support through the app fails to go through. Every. Time.",1
com.calea.echo,Dean C,Loved this product for years. Actually a paid user. The interface and private box were very good. But through each of the last two phones I have transferred this app to it has been excruciating to send or receive mms photos and messages. I've tried multiple texting apps with no issue on this subject. No one at Mood seems to be able to correct this and for the first time in over 10 years I'm changing apps.,2

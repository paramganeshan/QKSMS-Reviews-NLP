com.Slack,Julie LiÃªu Williams,"I don't get it. Why fix (break) what wasn't broken?! Before, I used to be able to start a post, come back to it, and everything was there. Add a photo to a post? No problem. Now when I leave the app & come back, my posts disappear from the channels I wrote them in & automatically get transferred to the Drafts channel. What's even more maddening is without even leaving the app, if I want to take a photo to add to a post, once I take the photo, the post has likewise disappeared, moved to Drafts.",2
com.Slack,Tyler Black,"My god, the number of glitches... Screens not loading, DMs not opening, clicking on a chat and nothing happens, crashes/app not responding, app not opening, notification showing up but then not appearing in the actual app?, Notifications not pushing (even though I have everything turned on... I'm sure I missed some things... This is a constant issue, not the occasional bug. Nearly all of these issues happen once a day, and I am required to use this terrible app for work. Motorola Edge+ 12.01",1
com.Slack,Allison P,"Update: Not sure what fixed it. (Clearing cache and re-installing did not,) but after sending feedback/logs it is working again. I just have to quickly scroll down twice (past a stutter/lag) to see older channel messages. Android app is broken. Can not see any channel history as of yesterday, yet it all shows for Apple, and shows when I use desktop. Multiple Android users are having the same issue.",3
com.Slack,Cory Archibald,Android app has become utterly unusable. I've been using the app for almost 6 years and always had a good experience. About 6 months ago I started having issues with the app failing to load new messages. I get a notification for a new message but the new message won't load unless I restart the app multiple times. Now after the most recent updates the app freezes and crashes repeatedly as I try to click on different channels or switch between communities. Extremely frustrating.,1
com.Slack,Matthew Bauman,"in most apps, if you're typing a message & need to look at another app for a second or turn the screen off briefly, you can go back to the app & the text is still there. Slack removes the text & saves it as a draft. I have 80 ""drafts"" right now. it's frustrating, confusing, & NOT GOOD in many ways. fix it. I have contacted Slack about this, about a year ago, but it still happens.",3
com.Slack,M Grinnell,"Been using the Android app for 4+ years now. General experience has been good, but a recent update or other change has caused the app to be unusable. I've cleared the cache, cleared all user data, and it persists. Switching from one channel to another in the same slack results in a blank page. Same when changing between slacks. Channels show as unread, but don't show any new messages. Push alerts for new messages work, but the channel doesn't show the new messages.",3
com.Slack,Sean Finkel,"There is a rare bug on Android which has emerged in the last six months I want to say where I write an entire message and press send and then it is just - gone. Never sends, never tells me it failed, just goes in to an abyss. Super frustrating as I then have to rewrite the entire message. Not productive. Good luck reproducing it though, but it's definitely a thing.",3
com.Slack,Paul Hoffman,"Slack gets worse and worse with each update. It's autoformater is incredibly broken, but there's no way to turn it off. You used to be able to set notification tones for each organization, but Slack decided to remove that. It's also so much heavier and requires an absurdly strong internet connection to load text messages, which used to not be the case. Slack used to be great, now it's nothing more than a hassle",1
com.Slack,Kentrell Owens,I don't know what new changes y'all have made recently but the Android app does not work. It doesn't open and when it does open it freezes when I switch channels. Please be responsible and roll back whatever changes you added until the app works properly. It has been this way for about 2 months now.,1
com.Slack,Allen Gwinn,"The Android app has deteriorated in usability over the past year. If you have more than about 5 groups you cannot change notification sounds on the others. It is unstable, freezes and becomes out of sync with the desktop. They also now delete messages after 90 days. Very poor CX",1
com.Slack,Summer Tuller,"Latest update makes app nearly unusable on android 13. I get notifications for messages that are not in my feed...i have to use the search tool to find them. Clicking on links in messages does nothing. I have notification icons in app but cannot find the new messages. Clicking on workspace icons leads to blank pages. Whatever you did, please undo it. This is a UX nightmare.",1
com.Slack,Chris Figueroa,"I very rarely leave reviews. That said, this app is unusable aside from notifications. I downgraded to its 2019 version. It's been my experience that whenever I open any channel or DM and begin typing, I have around 10 seconds to write a sentence or the app will crash. This has been consistent throughout most of the year, but this current iteration crashes even faster than any other version I've used.",1
com.Slack,Brian T.,"The new update is hot garbage. Fire your QA team. Half the time the app is not showing me the latest messages in a channel. I'll get a notification of a new message but it doesn't show up in the channel unless I force close the app and reopen it. This is completely unacceptable for a messaging app, and it never happened with the previous version. Also, it diverges from the desktop app's UI in a way that is inconsistent and frustrating. Don't ""fix"" what ain't broke.",1
com.Slack,Antoine Foggs,"The past week and a half, the app has stopped working properly. Some messages aren't fetched at all and are simply missing, and some messages refuse to send from the mobile side despite no other messaging application having issues. I love slack, but this is causing a lot of issues. It also appears to be happening on the iOS version I use as well. Please help.",3
com.Slack,Sami Saab,"Notifications don't work. Randomly either don't show up, or flash up momentarily and then vanish. Even worse, the app sets the message as read, so I can't see which channel it came from. Multiple times a day I have to manually cycle through all my channels to see what I've missed. Getting notifications on the phone breaks the entire tracking system. Amazing Slack can't figure out a problem solved by every other messaging app I use. Seems they don't think it's their problem.",1
com.Slack,Robert Bond,"First off I extremely dislike the new layout. I say that as nicely as possible. More importantly the app is just not working well for me. New messages are not loading, have to close the app and reopen it for them to show up. Notifications are missing at times. Many times when I click on a notification if I do get it it takes me to the channel but does not have the latest message so I have to close the app and reopen it.",1
com.Slack,A Google user,"Probably the most frustrating experience I've had with an app. Have tried installing across multiple devices, multiple times. Every time I try to create a new workspace it stalls at the company name or the app stops after the prompts. Infuriating. Doesn't matter how great the app may be if you can't start using the thing. I'm currently downloading Basecamp.",1
com.Slack,Justin Toman,"This app is awful. It frequently will just give up and never update. I'll see there are unread messages in a channel, but when I go to the channel, there's nothing there. Then on another device I can see the messages. Or sometimes I will select a channel and I'll just see a blank screen, no buttons, no text, no loading indicator, nothing, for a solid minute before it updates. This has been going on for at least a year. I do not believe this app will ever be good. I have wifi turned on at home.",1
com.Slack,joshua figueroa,I would have had a five star rating before the most recent update. I did not update for about 3 months but I decided to update about a week ago and have been having such a bad experience. I think there might be some sort of memory leak because about 30 seconds into having the app open things start to slow down exponentially to the point that you have to wait 30 seconds from when you actually tap on the text input field before the keyboard shows up and you can start typing. Unusable!,1
com.Slack,Ana Gabriela Pessoa,"This app is so unreliable. Whenever I get messages with preview notification on my phone I can't read them on the app, like they were never sent to me. How does that even happen?! Luckily I have the app on my laptop and can see the missing messages there but it is ridiculous how this keeps happening. Even when I can clearly see the message on the laptop it does not appear on my phone, it just skips to the next one. I never had an app with that issue before. I would love this app if not for that.",1
com.Slack,Christopher Burke,"Absolutely cannot stand the new full screen multi-tab interface. I opted out of the beta just to get rid of it. Now that the update hit I'm going to install the previous version. It's so annoying & cumbersome I'm leaving this review. Functionality is still fine as before but I just can't understand who would think these interface changes are an upgrade in any way. Wish software companies would stop trying to ""fix"" things that aren't broken. Or at least just make it a setting we can toggle, FFS",2
com.Slack,Simon Ninon,"It's okay. However, I frequently have new messages notifications, but these messages do not show up in the app. The app will highlight the channels with unread messages, but visiting these channels only shows the old messages. Nothing helps to solve the issue: killing the app, restarting the phone, clearing the cache. The only way is to either go to the desktop app, or wait for another message to be sent in that channel and hope that it will solve the issue. This is very frustrating.",2
com.Slack,Cuyler Jenkins,"Trash. Just trash. By default, the app's notification system is set to a weird time, and it syncs to the desktop app, so the desktop app gets bufu'd. When you change the desktop notifications, the mobile doesn't sync, so you gotta do it on the mobile app all over again. However, the most egregious Idiocracy is that the app doesn't have a default sound. So when it notifies you, it doesn't make any sound. I had to go into android OS and set a sound. Why? Just...why...?",1
com.Slack,Andrew Cichetti,"Notifications frequently do not show up. I had to set a periodic alarm to check for new posts. DMs and chats are listed alphabetically on the home page, not chrono. If you want to see them chrono, you have to tap a different page. If you read a message in the app or through the web without tapping the notification on your phone, the notification stays. One more little thing: when you're done typing, the 'back' arrow in the top left does not go back! It closes the keyboard first",2
com.Slack,Jacy Wiewiora,Update: everything is now resolved and there are no current issues. I find it easy to navigate and add spaces to. It works exactly like the desktop IMO. I finally received a job offer since last July and they use Slack. I cannot get it to even open. All I am able to see is a white screen. I can't leave my computer anymore because I will miss notifications so I have to constantly check in all day/night long.,5
com.Slack,Trevor Morgan,"Get rid of the huddles option! It's annoying and useless. We use Zoom and have no need for huddles. The option to hit one button in a channel and instantly invite everyone to a damn meeting is really annoying. The area they put this in, and without a second agreement before launching it, causes a lot of issues. It's at the top of my phone, and easy to click when trying to swipe down from the top. There should be at least a ""Yes or no?"" prompt before starting this.",1
com.Slack,Ken Dobbins (FracKen_A),"I am greatly disappointed with the new mobile app's navigation. After the recent updates to the desktop, I had high hopes for a great new mobile app. Having to swipe contently to get around is quite about for me. I am sure there are many who will love the new design, I just wish slack had a option to pick between the two interfaces.",1
com.Slack,Tom Horsley,"Same issue I see others writing about, I get a notification OK, then I click it and the app comes up, but that message isn't in the thread view. Once I got a notification for a message someone had added to, and the bit they added was in the thread view, but not the original text (was very confusing since that bit didn't make sense by itself). I've basically reached the point where I use the app just to hear the ""ding"", then I go to the web interface to read.",1
com.Slack,Lion Ness,"This app is really good for teamwork. I have used it on both phone and computer to have access to my chats at all time. The only problem I have so far on the mobile version is app inability to share video. There is an option to share photos and other files, but not video. The only way to share a video is from gallery; it's 2020 and most apps are capable of this.",3
com.Slack,Brandon Ragland,Doesn't fetch most recent messages. Ever since the last update (I'm completely up to date as of this review) the app doesn't fetch the most recent messages after I get the notification and go into the app to see/read what was sent. It worked perfectly fine until this recent update. Can't use it at all without constantly forcing a stop and then reopening the app. Super disappointed. Not cool to release an update that doesn't work. Might have to get my team switched to something else.,1
com.Slack,Anthony Raitani,"The consistent issues with this app for the past 3-4 months has been pretty bad. Examples: my drafts don't work. I can't edit a draft message, when I click the text field it takes me to a new message. My groups I organize my messages in doesn't save on the app from when I make edits on the desktop. I've had to reinstall the app 4 times because it lasts for days without updating. Proper notifications don't come through and I don't see messages HUNDREDS of times over the past few months.",3
com.Slack,A Google user,"It's OK, but I had initial trouble signing in. I've changed my initial rating from one to 3 stars now that it's working. The app seems to work OK now, but it's just one option of many ways to communicate with a group. You can integrate with other sharing services (like Google drive and Dropbox). I got it because it was ""required"" in a class in taking, and it seems to work alright for our purposes. Still, it feels like ""just another app"", in a world that's bloated with too much already.",3
com.Slack,David James Bunger,"Latest big revision involves swiping between screens, and whenever I try to tap something it registers it as a tiny swipe instead of a selection. I have to tap super lightly to make sure my finger doesn't contact more than a pinpoint on the screen. Did no one use the app before it was released? Also, messages seem to get lost - I get multiple notifications for incoming messages, but can only find one of them when I open the app. So frustrating.",2
com.Slack,John Desmond,"Works great. But the new version took away the ability to mute for 1, 2,4 hours, etc. Now you can only turn then on or off. If I don't want to be botherd with a channel I have to remember to turn it back on. Please bring back the other options again. I hope it still mutes my PC when I mute the phone. Have not checked that yet.",4
com.Slack,Laurie âBarely Subparâ Stewart,"I was very leery of Slack in the beginning... and now I love it, and it's reputation. The sheer simplicity of how they make integration of all their apps. To install or Uninstall. I do wish it had a little more for user preference settings. That's just because sight and lighting can just be picky. Only reason. Soothing color combos seem to help. But sometimes you just have to turn up the music, and hope your dime get a headache from the fun.",5
com.Slack,Shane Johnson,"I'm not getting any notifications on one of my companies channels. It was working before just fine. I left the channel and rejoined and it worked for a day and then stopped sending notifications again for that specific channel. The rest of the channels are sending notifications fine. I have all channels set up to get notifications. How can I fix this? Thank you for your response. I was able to troubleshoot my android and everything appeared fine. How do I run the notificaitons troubleshoot test on my desktop? That's where the issue is, thanks.",3
com.Slack,Willow Epp,"I guess it works, but it feels clunky. Lack of ability to view shared screens is a major mark against considering the competition (and webcams even work now, so it's not like video isn't something that can't be done in this very app). Nor is there an ability to synchronise an app connection with a desktop connection (for the screen sharing) so I end up appearing twice on calls. Also, a recent update took away the option to switch audio sources on calls, so to use my bluetooth headset I need to turn it off and turn it back on again FOR EVERY CALL. That pushes the experience down to unpleasant.",2
com.Slack,Sarah,"I've never had any issues with this app. I use it just for messaging my boss, nothing else. I can't speak to the other features it has, but sending pictures/messages/emojis seems to work just fine. Occasionally there is a glitch, but I think you'll be hard-pressed to find an app that doesn't glitch every now and again. Good concept, good app. I especially like the ""search messages"" feature, which has saved me a few times when trying to look back and find an address or something.",5
com.Slack,Ethan Roush,"This app has a good bit of features that are nice. Like theme personalization and having a personal thread for quick notes. It also syncs settings instantly between devices. However, it's a battery hog when open and in the background. Huddles are nearly useless on my Duo. When I open a thread, the prompt to join a huddle often crashes the whole app. And when someone stops a screen share in a huddle, it crashes. Contacted support - I'm not hopeful despite them being very kind.",3
com.Slack,Korinne M Jackman,"Ok, but not ""compatible"" with all my devices. It will no longer work on my tablet, not even within a browser. I'm stuck using it in my phone or on my PCs/Chromebook. That's inconvenient when at conferences; I don't want to have to lug a laptop everywhere. Otherwise, the app (on my phone) is adequate. I can do what I need to do, even though it's a small screen. The issues, however, have prompted my team to transition to Discord.",4
com.Slack,Kirill Badyulin,"App is simply bad. Both phone and desktop versions. Phone version never sends notifications, even though they are allowed. Desktop icon keeps showing that I have unread messages, even though theres none. And of course the best thing - in a free version - that you cant lookup older messages, unless you pay for it. And if you at last decide to pay for it, turns out that only ""the owner"" of the workspace can activate paying per person.",1
com.Slack,Jeremy Levin,"Unfortunately, it just feels like they're trying so hard to make it user-friendly that it takes all power out of the user's hands. I feel like I can't do anything. Trying to connect multiple accounts between my computer and phone is an awful process. The ""magic links"" that get sent to my email don't sign me in automatically. I can't tell which accounts are connected to which email, and there is no easy way to find that out. Customizing servers as an admin is impossible. Used the app for 4 years",1
com.Slack,A Google user,"Used to love this app, I use it for work and social. It's gone downhill in the last several months with random restarts, wrong status (showing people offline when they aren't), poor video experience (dropping calls on solid internet speeds, etc), messages seemingly randomly not sending, freezing on my pixel2, etc. Not impressed anymore. If there was a better option I'd tell my company to use it. I keep hoping it gets back to what I originally loved about it (reliable)",3
com.Slack,Brandon Dean,"Update ruins interface for me. It used to be I can open slack and be right where I left off. Now I have to swipe to get back to my conversation. I'll still use it because I have no choice but honestly it takes more effort to use this interface than the previous one. Also, why the bottom home dm ECT ribbon? Pointless, takes up more screen space and I could easily just choose what I want from the list like before. It used to be I could bring this up when I wanted. Now there is no choice.",1
com.Slack,Christina Forbes,I really like slack however I have a Samsung se 10 (I think) and recently the app has been freezing hard core or the screen stutter/shakes. I figured this would be the best way to alert the developers. It used to work fine and in a timely manner but now it's almost unusable. I constantly have to switch to my iPad or computer to use which is fine when I'm home but inconvenient when I'm not. I see there's a long line of Samsung users here experiencing this issue too. Plz fix!,3
com.Slack,Daniel Barton,"Latest update cluttered the UI significantly and made it difficult to use. The latest update also broke message sending. My messages now fail to send each time, no matter how many times I tap them to attempt to resend. I tried submitting a feedback message... and it also failed to send. Previous versions of the app were fantastic - hopefully these issues are resolved soon",1
com.Slack,Ahmed Taleb,"This app is little more than a read/reply version of the desktop version. There are no options for customization, sorting deleting channels/threads, etc. Unread channels ""conveniently"" move to the top of the stack so you need to scroll all over the place to find a channel. If I didn't need to stay connected to work conversations, if delete immediately.",1
com.Slack,Chris Silber,I don't know how you could roll out a new UI with so many bugs and issues. I can barely use my phone app right now and I can't trust it to get or send messages in real time. It's not like I'm doing complicated things on Slack. These things are the basic backbone of the system: sending and receiving messages. It sucks to log in on the desktop and see that my phone app just wasn't loading new threads. Fix the Android App.,1
com.Slack,Amy Ryan,"Lately when I see a highlighted channel and tap it, sometimes it doesn't show the new message in the app, even though there is one. The channel remains highlighted and there's nothing I can do to refresh it to get it to show the message. Very inconvenient for a product my job uses. I just have to get on a computer or wait until the app decides to show the message. Force closing the app as restarting it doesn't work either. Please fix it ð­",2
com.Slack,Cory Haskill,"This app has gotten worse over the past few weeks. It used to be pretty smooth. Now the screen jumps around constantly. It notifies way too much, every pic upload interrupts what you are doing with a big ugly pop-up! This is not needed. It makes the screen jump and pulls you off of text, or what you have moved on to. The way it saves and uploads pics is so out dated! 1 pic a time?!?! I have to use my own camera app and transfer yhem over in groups. It is a very sloppy app. HAVE TO USE FOR WORK.",2
com.Slack,A Google user,"we use this app for our organization and it works great--most of the time. Recently, I have been having major issues however. My messages will randomly disappear after I have posted them. very frustrating!! Sometimes a message also appears to post twice, but then *usually* corrects to only having sent once after closing and reopening the app. Please fix!!",4
com.Slack,Hunter Andrieu,"Not getting notifications. I use Slack for work. I cannot find a setting in Slack that will send me a notification (auditory and visual) every time there is a group message sent. I miss messages because I don't hear my phone go off and this affects my performance at work. I'm extremely frustrated by this, the option to get notified every time immediately does not exist. No matter how nice the interface, I still cannot call this app functional. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible.",3
com.Slack,Sean Smith,"The redesign for the Slack app made the app worse to use. Although gestures have been adjusted, the most recent update broke the ability to quickly and easily ""flick from left edge"" to access channels and workspaces. Now said behavior scrolls the chat on phones with curved displays especially. There's not much in terms of Preferences to turn off or disable this. The same feature has also caused reacting to messages to be harder (gesture takes over as a swipe despite a quick tap).",3
com.Slack,Lisa âTinxNemesisâ Eckersley,"Very reliable. I mainly use this for my family but have used it to coordinate with numerous people. The private message and group message is great to use when discussing individual or a co-op effort. Having the capability to have multiple rooms for separate projects or conversations is great. It links with drives, calendars, and notes to keep track of your daily/weekly/monthly functions.",5
com.Slack,Hia Phua,"Update is making every interaction I have miserable. It's as if the screen freezes every time I try to tap or text, like my touch screen is covered with goo. But it's not my phone - no problem with other apps. Everything takes 10 times longer. Editing to clarify the similarity to another reviewers's experience where a tap seems to be interpreted as a tiny swipe - so the screen bounces around when I try to place my text input cursor somewhere else in a text box, or when I try to tap Enter.",2
com.Slack,charlie howard,"The app has always had minor issues in the past, messages not showing, gifs never work right. Some polls wouldnt work. Posting videos seem to have random issues. But it still seemed to work for what we use it for. It is slowly getting better UNTIL NOW I CANNOT GET IT TO WORK SUDDENLY DUE TO NO SUPPORT OF OLDER ANDROID VERSIONS. The tech support seems to be less than helpful. I hope it will work again and get back to its constant improvement track like it was going.",1
com.Slack,Tamara Ham,"I use this app because it's the one my boss has chosen to use as communication for our team. Personally I find it challenging to find old message threads, archived projects, and where and how to post special links for graphs, charts and spreadsheets. Overall it keeps the team organized. I just don't find it very user friendly.",3
com.Slack,Bennett Boothe II,Very useful communication device with awesome additional features and control of notifications. Excellent for business use. Lately the experience has become inconsistent. 1. The app will erase my draft/message I'm typing if I rotate my screen or put the app in the background. 2. The app will remove the attachment before I send it when I begin typing a message to go with it. Happy to help if the developer wants to work together to gather examples.,2
com.Slack,Dan Algarin,"Removed a star. Issue below might be fixed but since notifications rarely work, it is hard to tell. Mobile app suffers from an updating issue. Often will receive a notification that a new message has arrived, but clicking on the notification will bring up the appropriate channel without the new message(s). Is necessary to actually close the app and reopen to get the message(s) to show. Have heard same complaint from other users. Difficult to find in-app feedback option is pretty much useless.",1
com.Slack,Dan Fox,New app is absolutely horrible. The inappropriate use of swipe (now for navigation instead of specific functions) cause you to have to try 345 times to long press anything as it always thinks you're swiping. App defaults to channel list instead of most recent conversation. Notifications don't work right anymore. Blown away that everything was made harder to use instead of easier.,1
com.Slack,Kiel Loysen,Normally I think slack is a great app but in the last 24 hours it has become completely unusable for any extended period of time. If I kill it and start fresh I can get maybe a message out before it completely slows down and becomes unresponsive. Sometimes channel rendering and navigation just freeze at a loading view and other times the keyboard becomes borderline impossible to use. Very frustrating,2
com.Slack,Kaisa Crawford-Taylor,"Pretty robust and includes almost all features as the desktop app. Only one I can't think of at the moment is adding a custom emoji, which doesn't affect my daily work. Overall slack is good. I wish they supported video calls. I like being able to set different notifications for my mobile device vs my desktop. The search function is great too. It does take 5-10 minutes for me to upload a photo and the preview show up. But overall it's a 5/5.",5
com.Slack,Garrett E,"The app suddenly started crashing and not responding A LOT. Chews through battery. And a feature they used to have has been gone for a while: auto clearing Android notifications once you view a message on desktop. All in all, an app that started out AMAZING two or so years ago has gotten worse to the point of me literally being unable to use it due to the app being unresponsive and crashing",1
com.Slack,Thomas Crump,"Works at a basic level but is buggy compared to iOS and Windows versions of the app. Sensitivity for sliding left and right between levels of conversation is inconsistent (not sensitive enough), which funnily enough is the opposite issue from the last update. Notifications will occasionally fail to come through, and indications that someone else is typing sometimes don't show when they should or show when they shouldn't. Could be better, and is lacking compared to other messaging apps.",3
com.Slack,Doug Tucker,"After recent update, the android app is completely broken on my chromebook. I can sign in, but the right hand pane where convos should exist isn't even there. If I select a channel, I can see the existing convo...it opens in like a full window, and the panel list on the left is gone. And from there, the back button doesn't work, so I can't get back to the channel list without closing the app out and starting over.",1
com.Slack,Wes Sullivan,"Since the latest update, major features no longer work. I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get some features to function. It is difficult to reply to messages because my home screen buttons cover the message box. The 3 dot menu doesn't function at all so I cannot set my status or change my preferences. Sometimes I cannot even select a channel to talk in. It is the only app that I have trouble with on my tablet.",1
com.Slack,RJ Smith,"The new update is really buggy. I get notifications for new messages, but when I click on the notification, it goes to the channel but doesn't show the message. Non of the new messages are showing up and the bold indicator of the channel won't go away. Very annoying since I don't have access to my laptop right now.",1
com.Slack,A.M. Lynn,"I updated the app a couple of days ago. It worked fine before. Now the emoji that are responses to messages randomly disappear and reappear. The emoji picker is slow to load, partially blocked, and difficult to close (as a double backspace no longer works). I regret updating. Edit: Almost a month later, these problems have not been fixed.",3
com.Slack,A Google user,"Disappointed I cannot view other's shared screen.  Also, the call reconnect logic isn't very robust.  My Wi-Fi is not very stable due to lots of nearby APs, so my Wi-Fi drops frequently.  Slack detects the network drop, says it is reconnecting, but it hangs forever and I have to force kill the app before I can rejoin calls.  Happens multiple times per day.  Boo!",3
com.Slack,Dave,"There is no way a company of Slack's size and stature should have released a product this buggy. It's clearly untested on Android tablets. Menu items don't work, channels always appears when switching to the app no matter what you were on before, and channels is empty, no notifications on DMS, and tech support will ask you for a screenshot when they could just try it themselves. Boo! I don't want to reach out to you again. Acknowledge the problems in Play and deploy a fix.",1
com.Slack,A Google user,Unreliable. I've been playing with the notification settings for two weeks. I've tried every configuration. I still do not get notification for some message and I'll get them for other. can't stand this app. I will be pushing to stop using it at work until the notification system is more reliable.,1
com.Slack,Kris Yates,"[Update 5/26/20: Problem appears to be fixed! Thanks Slack!] Navigation, look, feel, and basic usage all are fine. Biggest issue for me is that the latest update made uploading photos take so long. For some reason, on my Pixel 2 XL, when I go to select a photo, it takes a ridiculously long time to show the photos in the upload gallery. Not sure if this is a common issue.",5
com.Slack,Christian Jackson,"I am writing this in hopes that someone from the developing team views this message about a suggested change I have in regards to using the mobile app. When viewing messages inside a channel on the mobile app, if a member is currently typing, Slack will notify you with a recurring message at the bottom of the chat stating ""${member-name} is typing..."". This notification message is recurring until the member finishes typing. The problem with this feature in the mobile app is every time this notification message recurs it shifts all messages in the channel up slightly to make room for the notification message to be displayed. When the notification message temporarily disappears it shifts all messages back down. The continual shifting up and down anytime another member is typing makes reading the other messages in the channel very difficult and unpleasant. This is a great app, I use it for both work and personal use. Thank you to all the developers that have made the overall experience so good. I hope this review reaches the right team(s) and this isolated yet impactful issue is resolved.",4
com.Slack,A Google user,"After the slack team pointed out how to change the back button/gesture behavior, the app has become immensely more usable and I propose that the toggle for this should be set to channel list by default and allow user to select exit if they want to  (but who would want that anyway?). Gets the job done if you get your settings and configurations just right. Still no match to the desktop app.",4
com.Slack,Bookpast Official,Was good. Then suddenly updated and boom: all my productivity goes out the window with a new design that is much less intuitive and less efficient than before.

com.Slack,AJ Gudmundsen,"Inconsistent. Sometimes I get messages right away, sometimes not. If my desktop app is open, not necessarily ""foreground"" but minimized, my mobile doesn't receive notifications.

Not until I ""reset cache"" can I see the new messages. This is a daily occurrence.",3
com.Slack,Kevin Kauffold,"The app is completely unreliable sending notifications. I only see messages came in when I look for them.

Pretty embarrassing for the company who thinks they'll be the end of email.",1

Laptop callers get a horizontal rectangle within the vertical one. I can't rotate my phone out of vertical mode. Also, when I clear notifications, it's a 50/50 shot they actually clear on that device. It's a slim to none chance they clear on others. Clearly their priorities are feature quantity and NOT quality.",1

Right back to it's old ways of deleting photos in the cache, kicking you out of keyboard and speak to text UI's, and consuming battery too quickly. I hate it. It has been detrimental to my work.",1

Example - when I go to reply, the android navigation buttons are over the text box in portrait mode, so clicking in that box just closes the app. I was able to work around this by switching to landscape mode, but then you can't see what you're writing or the message thread. Now also if your phone switches back to portrait in the middle of writing you lose the whole message you just wrote. Basically unusable on Android.",1
com.Slack,A Google user,I hate this app. Notifications sometimes take forever to get. It is super annoying as a workplace tool. I have to be subscribed to like 10 channels and get notifications 24 hrs a day. I can't keep track of what is going on. This needs to be streamlined somehow to make it less busy. Maybe have channels people can't reply to or something. The whole app could easily be replaced with texting and phone calls. Kind of a waste of time.,1

com.Slack,Abby Baumbach,This app is so helpful! I'm in theater and we don't all have phones and ways to communicate and we use Slack. It's so much easier than having to send out a message to each and everyone. I definitely recommend this.,5

com.Slack,Meisam Rasouli,"The app is very good for team collaboration and new members can easily sign up to join the workspace. However, I have a few suggestions. The channel names must allow spaces and capital letters so that it is easier to find a particular channel. The distinction between consecutive messages are somewhat obscure, and it is difficult to select and edit the right message without mistaking the nearby message. Despite these shortcomings I will give the app a five star rating.",5
com.Slack,Daniel Veihelmann,"I use Slack on my desktop (browser) and the mobile app, and it's very frustrating that notifications aren't in sync anymore. My phone still shows notifications that I read hours ago in the browser. I know that this affects our entire team (not sure about iOS). Please fix this, this used to work in the past. I had mixed feelings about the new UI, but I'm actually fine with it now. (Though not sure if it's a good idea to have a non-standard navigation for the average user...)",3
com.Slack,A Google user,"It's okay. The app definitely requires a strong, steady network connection, otherwise you're bound to see a dreaded ""Connecting..."" message permanently. It seems very picky about the stability of its connection, which is kind of a bummer for teams deployed on the field trying to get i touch with the office. It's image upload is very lacking in that aspect. It will upload pictures in full resolution, which arguably is a good thing for graphic designers but a terrible thing when trying to show a quick snap of something. The photo sharing feature of any other messaging app (which resizes and compress the image) is far more suited. It's just impossible to upload full resolution pictures on flaky connections.",3
com.Slack,A Google user,"This app just simply doesnât care if I have allowed the data access or not. Despite completely stopping the access to mobile data and wifi, it still runs in the background, connects with the internet and receives the texts. Extremely intrusive and not something to have installed on your phone. If this is how it behaves, then it can't be trusted. Uninstalled.",1
com.Slack,A Google user,"The app itself is great, but this might be the worst notifications on an android messenging app I've ever seen. The notifications don't stack by channel, don't have any noticeable difference between normal messages and ones with any kind of @, there's always only one notification on the notification bar regardless of how many unread messages from one or more channels. I could go on forever, nowadays it's just unacceptable to have something like this on the market.",2
com.Slack,Alex Hayward,"This app would be great if it wasn't for the dreadful issue with notifications. I have been using this app for over 3 years at this point. And everything about the app itself is nice and feature-full. It has message channels, a desktop version, file sharing, formatting, search history, a nice interface, etc. However, when you send a message, you can pretty much guarantee it will not be seen any time soon. The actual message is sent, but nobody will notice until they open the app themselves manually. There have been too many times when important messages have been missed and time has been wasted. Due to this, we have had to resort to standard text messages for any critical or important messages. I have been holding out hope that this issue will one day be fixed, but at this point I've given up. This has been a problem since at least December 2018, but from what I can tell from searching the internet, this goes back to 2016. We have followed all instructions given by Slack about battery optimisation settings etc, but these have made no difference. This is the only messaging app that has any issues with push notifications, so I feel this must be an issue with the app itself. Until Slack do something to fix these issues, I advise users to be aware.",2
com.Slack,Aditya Bhat K,"I'm getting my messages delayed quite often...sometimes the previous messages don't show up, but the latest messages show up. After I close the application and reopen, I'll get the messages properly. Sometimes I do cache clear to fix - but it's annoying to do often. Also, when I check a new message, the notification won't clear indicating that it's read. I use Slack both on phone and laptop. At first I thought this might be due to network issues, but it's not the case.",4
com.Slack,Matthew Harrison,It works often and other times the notifications are a total pain and either don't appear or appear a day later. Today I saw 7 notifications on my laptop that didn't appear in my phone from yesterday. This happens randomly and seems to be the same for many people and is a fundamental failure of a messaging app! There seems to be a similar issue with calls which sometimes won't work. Apart from that the app is OK but doesn't really 'flow'. It doesn't show additional workspaces. Not sure if this is just my app or that I need to manually configure additional sign-ins but would have thought that it would mirror my laptop. There are probably a lot of improvements that could be made but the basics really need to be sorted out.,2
com.Slack,Shaun Tan,"New interface is horrible. It used to be that you could seamlessly swap between laptop and phone and comfortably use a familiar interface. While I'm open to re-learning an interface like how FB has revamped theirs on multiple occasions, the deal breaker for me here is the simple fact that I can't even see messages I get notifications for on my phone. I get notified, then when I load the app and chat, it doesn't show the new messages. Which means I have to boot up my laptop to reply. Ridiculous.",1
com.Slack,Moulik Gupta,"A few issues that i have experienced in the app: 1. The notifications are a bit slower than the mac version. 2. The feed doesn't update sometimes, there is a lag in a message being posted and it showing up on my channels. 3. Sometimes I view a message but it shows up as unread and the notification dot stays on the icon. I hope these issues are resolved. Happy to give a 5 star rating then :)",3
com.Slack,Emil,"Great laptop app. On mobile however, the menu chats are gone. I can't see any icons or titles or text, save for some green dots indicating when someone is online. This may be because of my phone, as it is an older model. Nevetheless the app is still useable, and I enjoy it, save for some bugs and annoyances. It's worth mentioning that I use it as an employee. Had I been paying for this I don't think I'd be as ambivalent.",3
com.Slack,Johan Runsten,"When slack works, it is great for IM, both for work and private. I use it everyday. However it is awkward to deal with anything else like files and search. I am having issues with the app on my phone not receiving notifications at all or too late, channels stop updating and bad performance. The support unfortunately have only confirmed that these are indeed bugs and there is no fix as of yet.",3
com.Slack,Danny T,"Since the last update there is a serious problem with constructing messages, as you cannot easily move around the text field to correct typos or edit what you have written. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's feels like there is a problem with the screen recognising a tap, but it is fine on my other apps. Workaround is to ""long press"" as if you are highlighting a word but this is really time consuming. Borderline unusable unless writing short, simple replies. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S9.",1
com.Slack,A Google user,"Good app but UX on android is a bit awkward, for me at least. the app remembers the last channel you were in when it opens. So, the way my brain works, I expect the back button to take me back to the home/channel selection drawer. Instead it exits the app, which i find really frustrating. Makes me believe this has been adapted from iOS behaviour.",3
com.Slack,A Google user,Love the idea but having trouble with the adoption. I'm a heavy android mobile based user and a frustrating factor for me is that I'm unable to receive any form of notification from any channels. Went through the suggested steps in the Help Center but there wasn't any change. Not sure if it's faced by others but it'll be great if there could be some way to resolve this.,3
com.Slack,A Google user,"Was working fine this morning, then tried to use this afternoon and apparently my OS is no longer supported and I can't access the app at all not even to see previous messages. Super frustrating. I have a Samsung Galaxy S6. Not a new phone by any means but still works perfectly. The about this message suggested it could still be used but might not be perfect. It will not work AT ALL! Grrr.",1
com.Slack,Dennis Arlow,"Ever since the last update, the app becomes unresponsive. It lags when you type. I've never had to close and then restart the app as much as I have to do now. I've been using it basically since the beginning on different mobile devices, always worked really well until now. If I didn't use Slack so much, I would uninstall the app completely. Extremely frustrating! Please fix ASAP! Update - everything is working again as expected after the last update. Thanks for the fix.",5
com.Slack,A Google user,"I love slack but this app needs fixing... I open it on my phone once in a few days, and when I do, all the messages I have received in my chats start coming as notifications. Not just the unread ones but also the ones I have read in the desktop app. Sometimes when I have a lot of messages, the notifications won't stop coming and beeping for a minute, which is really annoying.",2
com.Slack,Vikrant Mulani,Stopped working for Samsung Galaxy A5. Recently it has started crashing all the time and I just can't type on it. It's not usable at all and should be fixed. It is causing to many issues. My OS tells me it uses 4% of the battery. It has stopped responding 10 times in a day. It looks like memory leak issue which should be looked at. I can't try and reinstall the app at this stage.,1
com.Slack,Borislav Georgiev,"Extremely messy, enormously bulky and ridiculously primitive app. This app is something which is not supposed to exist at all. It's super unreliable, bloated and slow. You never get your messages in real time, the layout is incredibly confusing and on top of that it takes 900 MB from my phone's storage! This is unbelievable. This is more than all my other apps out together. Not to mention that there is no ""Mark as read"" option in the pull down menu. The developers seem to be a bunch of idiots.",1
com.Slack,Amber no,"Great app overall but the new update... I'm sorry but this is absolutely hideous. No need to fix something that ain't broken. Also, bring back the timed channel muting options. Just roll out the old version, as this is horrid. If I didn't have to use it for work, would have deleted it straight away as I'm appaled every time I open the app. Not intuitive at all, is ugly and uncomfortable.",1
com.Slack,Aravind Nair,"Good experience. Would be nice to have ""Mark as read"" in the notification panel instead of me having to open the app or switch between multiple workspaces. And the new interface isn't visible on all workspaces. It's weird to have two different interfaces at the same time. Update: Thanks for replying! I went into each of my workspaces, closed app and opened again. Now it's working fine. But that certainly should have happened automatically. Have updated the rating.",4
com.Slack,Cez Sta,"I would give 5, because when it was working, it was working without any major issues and was fairly well designed application.

I'd award Slack app with no points for that, if I could.",1
com.Slack,Rahul Bhatia,"Really like the latest UI. The 3 compartments and the easy sliding-gliding interface. DO NOT CHANGE this.

It's aggravating to have to always scroll through the groups and channels when you're trying to find a channel in a group that DOESN'T have any new messages. It's like Slack hired developmentally disabled, half-blind, antagonistic Chimpanzees to develop the user interface for this app. And did I mention that you can't get to ANY settings in the app?

com.Slack,vincent daubry,Same bug report as other people here : since the last update (09/07/2021) when i switch team in the left menu i'm asked to sign out.

com.Slack,A Google user,It is the perfect tool for groups working together on a project because it sorts in the most efficient way the messages sent (you can create the so called channels in which you discuss only on this topic) and the files are all gathered in one place so that you can return at any point and find them easily... you can even search them by who sent the files. Only thing I would want to be added is to have a notification on whether the messages have been read by the other members,5
com.Slack,A Google user,"Decent application but doesn't do some things I want it to. I can't upload videos into channels or messages, and in low network areas I can't tap on a name from the menu and it take me there. It often takes like 5 tries. Pretty frustrating.",4

com.Slack,A Google user,"So frustrating! There's no way to set your status or availability from the Android app. The only thing you can do is go in and out of DND. You can't set a status icon or status message. Even worse, Slack's own help pages give directions that don't match the app! It tells you to tap the three-dot button and then tap ""Set Status."" There is no ""Set Status"" option in that menu. Was it removed?",1

No. It's someplace inside channel itself.) The reliability issue I reported before turned out to be caused by the overly aggressive vendor 'power manager'. Turning it off solved the issue.",4
com.Slack,Ryan Breeze,It just sucks. The app is confusing to use and makes no logical sense. I try to start a new message to someone and it only lets me select a group chat they're in.

com.Slack,A Google user,The concept is good but execution is poor. Standard chatting features such as replying to comments are missing. This is unacceptable for an app in 2020 especially one that wants to be used for collaboration. The channel feature is neat but discord does a better job by having servers and different channels within them that are further broken by text and voice channels.

Been holding back from being a paid user because of this. Samsung or Slack issue?? Using Samsung Note 10 Plus (colleague with Note 9 has the same exact issues) - direct phone call is STUCK to loudspeaker (only 2 buttons, Red hangup icon or mute icon) and conversations become public!Where's the 3rd button (choice of loudspeaker mode or telephone-direct to ear?)",1

com.Slack,Zach Saw,Terrible UX. Scrolling is so slow it's unusable on s20+! Android detected Slack as battery drainer too. Worst app I've ever used! Edit. Cleared cache. And it's worse.

com.Slack,Brendan Lin,Extremely terrible update to the new interface. I used to be able to select text in the threads to copy to another app. That's something that I use on a daily basis and it's really weird that such a feature is removed.

The reason for all of this is they want you to buy a premium plan, which my employer, a small independent business, refuses to do. Two of the three problems I have are supposedly better if you have premium, but it doesn't change the fact that changing notifications preferences is like pulling teeth, and you will get tons of notifications by default, to the point where you'll want to throw your phone/tablet/computer out a window.",3

The most important thing to keep in mind about Slack is that you can't expect it to be just another messaging app -- it is much more than that -- it is more like a communication and sharing platform built around messaging. When you combine Slack with other apps, some amazingly powerful things can happen. The Android app is very close to the desktop app experience, unlike many mobile apps that are often weak when compared to their desktop version. Many of the negative reviews seen here are based on poor connectivity having nothing to do with Slack or resulting from ignorance of the Slack features that allow amazing control over everything including notifications for each channel and availability. Once you understand what Slack is, you probably won't complain about what it isn't.

The reason I'm writing this so called 'review' is to ask the people behind this how can I download the PC version of this program on my PC? I have it already on my phone and all I do here is get the msg of what devices that I have that it's compatible with of my phones but nothing is mentioned about a PC version.

My boss told us that if we didn't want management to read our messages to make sure we do it in a private and not public Chanel but come to find out they could read them anyway! ð¤¥,1

Not even e-banking or authenticator apps are making a big deal with Android 7, yet biz comms Slack has decided itâs best to put ancient 4 year old tech under the cutting edge guillotine. I'm using what used to be the flagship Galaxy S6 which still functions as such, and I have no intention of changing it because a single app demands it. Slack is currently enjoying its moment of monopoly which allows them to push through these unpopular decisions without much consequence, but theyâve firmly put themselves on the path of complacency and inevitable decline that many tech companies have traveled down before.",1

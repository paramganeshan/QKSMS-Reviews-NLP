com.moez.QKSMS,Al Pray,Excellent app. I have overcome the issues other people reported with images by specifying MMS messages and increasing the compression size in the settings. The app is very customizable and it also includes the ability to archive messages. It's also the only text app that I found so far that has an option to have texts turn the screen on when the screen is dark see you can see the text without having to touch your phone.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,William Irvine,"Update: Realized open conversations don't notify of new messages with the screen off. Kind of a big issue for me. Original: Pretty good, but MMS ""fixes"" haven't worked. Still can't send picture messages after 3 updates that claimed to fix it. I like the app pretty well, but this is a big problem. EDIT: I can send photos reliably now, but they get compressed down to 300KB, which is pretty low resolution. It'll work for now, but not very well.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Mopar Man,Ever since I paid for the all access features this app has really gone downhill. Every time I try to send a picture or a screenshot it fails to send and tells me to try again - it never works. I never had problems before sending photos or screenshots via text. This is a pretty useless texting app if you can't send screenshots or pictures. The only time I can now send a picture is if I reduce the resolution so far that the pic becomes almost unviewable. I'll be looking for a better texting app.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've upgraded my rating!  I've had the app for a few weeks now and am liking it.  I paid so I can have the schedule message feature. It is worth the upgrade. I like that I can send more than 2 photos at a time which I could not do with my previous app. And they just added the feature to copy certain parts of the text instead of the whole text being copied!  One main reason for choosing the app is that the developers actually read and respond to users. And they take into consideration those points that can be improved upon! Thanks for listening guy!!  Kudos to you! One of the other things my old app use to do that was WAY cool was it had a voice recorder option, any chance of adding that cool feature??? ;D",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Aaron Swain,"UPDATE: Since my initial review, I've discovered that this app cannot send pictures, no matter what compression setting I choose. I'm on Verizon, so I doubt this is a carrier issue. Really disappointed, but I guess I can just use another app to do that. Really inconvenient though. Almost perfect. Does everything it's supposed to. I just wish you could customize the theme more, like changing the colors of the sent and received bubbles overall, like you can in other apps like Textra.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Thanks for the quick response. I'll verify that the contacts are available like you indicated. Regarding my comment about the attachment buttons: I use dark mode, and the attachment buttons are black. The background is black. It's hard to make out the dark buttons on the dark background. I'd also like to be able to send a voice memo. I couldn't fit that on my original post. Thank you!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the app! It's very clean and I love being able to customize the colors. It's also just really nice to be able to use and support open source apps. The only complaint I have is I can't receive any mms messages. They show up as empty messages, and even if I turn on my data and try to sync messages, nothing happens. Edit: My phone is the US model of the S10e, so no dual sim.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Hannah Franks,"Honestly, I really liked this app at first, but for the last... 6 or so months (I've lost track of time, so it could be longer), it doesn't let me send photos or GIFs. Super annoying to have to send it through another app every time. I've been through all my settings thinking I messed with something, but just found another review having the same problem, so I don't think it's just me... If it weren't for this issue, I'd say, definitely a 5 star app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great messaging app! I have been experiencing issues with my default SMS app, so I switched to this one. It's nice and easy to use and they update fairly regularly. I love the additional color choices, adds to the personality of the app. I only wish they add a feature that allows you to put an image in the background of the message, adjust the transparency and all that. Here's to hoping!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Hailey Macias,"I had such high hopes! But I can't send pictures, videos, or gifs. They'll send if they're compressed, but it.compresses them so much you can't even tell what it's supposed to be. When I change the setting to ""no compression"" it just says ""failed to send, tap to try again"" and never sends. I love the app, the look, and all the customization options, but not being able to send media is a deal breaker.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Almost there. I've been looking for a messaging app to replace my stock one. I like this one so far, has a few glitches here and there, but the developer takes your feedback serious and works to improve it. Quick responses too. Gonna stick with this for a bit and see how improvements are made to it. Edit: I emailed you about it ""blinking"" or refreshing everytime I open it. Also noticed now, when I attach a picture, it sends the person the correct one, but shows me a completely different picture.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Timothy J,"Everything about this app is perfect except one very important thing... Sending photos. You either have to have it set to send the photo at a very poor image quality, or if you have it set at regular high quality it just returns a ""Failed to send"" error message. I don't understand why this is the only app that does this? Reading through the reviews, this seems to be the biggest problem people are experiencing. If all other messaging apps have this basic capability wouldn't you tackle this issue?",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, very snappy. Always use it on any Android phone I get. Only thing that bugs me is that it seems to completely lack the ability to send videos. It can send photos, but videos don't even show up as an option in the gallery. It will display videos that are sent to you, and it keeps track of videos you send with other messaging apps.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'm really liking this texting app a whole lot, was using Android Messages but that was gets laggy at times and it uses way too much space! This has the look of Android Messages but texting is way faster with this app. The only thing is I would like to change the contact colors in the list, I'm able to do it for each conversation but I would like to see it in the list as well. Other than that everything works just fine. Thank you so much for a great app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Other than missing a timestamp option and not having the features that have been ""coming soon"" for what seems like forever, and the fact that the scheduled sending is finicky at best, the app is clean and customizable to the point of fitting virtually anyones tastes without being over the top. It has some nifty features that work most of the time... The floating panel for incoming messages sporadically shows nothing, requiring you to open the full screen app, which defeats the purpose.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Honestly, one of the best SMS apps I've seen. My favorite part about it is the layout and customization, it's very easy to navigate and has theming comparable to apps like Textra. It's fairly priced too, which unlocks things like delayed sending and custom colors. Definitely some features to add though, but even as of now, it's one of the best. Edit: Just some small features, like per contact signatures. Also maybe a way to change the color of outgoing messages. Keep up the awesome work!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Sam Miller,As soon as I downloaded the app I was in love. I was using Google messages for the longest time once I switched to this one I was hooked. Unfortunately the only downside is that I have the note 20 ultra and the pictures are amazing but when I go to send them they no longer look great. I switch to auto compression or no compression where the pictures still look great but they won't send. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"looks good. the one feature i need from a text messaging app is the ability to customize notifications based on the content of the message. i get email-to-text messages which has a different from address every time, so i can't use your customized contact notification, but the text of the messages are similar, so i have used keyword searching to customize the notification sound. if you could get that, i would become a paying customer, because my current app (smart notify) doesn't do mms.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Super lightweight but functions perfectly! This is exactly what I needed on my old, beat-up phone. I like that you can easily archive messages and I like that it has a quick reply pop up. The only small thing I'd like added would be the ability to more easily open the full conversation from the quick reply. But that's a minor complaint, you guys did a great job! Thanks for keeping it small and looking great on night mode.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've used a variety of messaging apps and always seem to return to QKSMS. Don't really know why I always fall back to this messaging app, but what I do know, is that it works and has been consistent and reliable. One suggestion I have is for premium color selection. It would nice to have the ability to enter rgb/cmyk/hex numbers. Perhaps, also a preview of the color being applied before confirming the change.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Updating my previous review. A recent update fixed the issue that saving a photo to the gallery didn't actually save it there. Now it prompts for access permission and so successfully saves the image. However, there is another issue. It saves the photo with a date as of the same not the date property on the original image. I just went back to save some images in a text thread, most recent to oldest, and they were saved with current date, making it look like the older images were the more recent",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really enjoying using this app. However, there is a minor issue that I hope developer will fix. The contact does not appear to sync with the conversation. even if i linked contacts, it only shows their phone number. They only sync when I delete the conversation, text them again from the system contact. If the issue were to be fix, this would be a 100/100 sms app!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Honestly, one of the reasons I got this app was because the developer seemed to actually consider people's suggestions. Love the clean simple design and NO adds! Please keep it that way. The only suggestion I would have is that it would be great to be able to use ringtones I've downloaded, not just my phone's default ones. Other than that, this is a great app! EDIT I'm having issues with the number showing in the text not matching up with my contacts",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Blair Johnson,"9 July 2021: App worked great for a couple years. Recently, however, it will not send an SMS to multiple recipients. Instead, it sends the contact information for the additional recipients to the first recipient. I tried using the Help & Feedback link, but that only goes to a PayPal page. So I emailed the developer a couple days ago but have not heard back.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Edit: as of this point, neither pictures nor videos will send. I will be unfortunately switching back to my default messenger. Original review: Pretty good, but still needs work. My main gripe is that attaching pictures on a samsung phone takes multiple clicks. Also, it is current impossible to send video with the app. The app is on the right track, but definitely needs more work.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,SmallBlock351 SmallBlock351,"I would love to use this app all the time but I like to send pictures or videos via text message and it just doesn't allow that! I haven't had any trouble with the app other than what I just stated. If they would just update the app to send videos & pictures thru text messages it would be my primary texting app! Come on now, we can fly to other planets, take a heart from one person and put it in another person so you should be able to make this app send and receive videos & pictures.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Rob Leisy,"Great fast performing text app. Good customization, organizes media within a conversation better than any other app in the store, and has an overall great feature set. One gripe and one question. Wish it had 1second as a delayed sending option. Lastly, is the app opening to the conversation list instead of the conversation I was in when exiting the app a feature or a bug? Having to tap the conversation I was just in when leaving the app to, let's say, copy an address from maps is annoying.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Moez your app is just so amazing. I love it so much! There's a lot that I prefer about your app compared to other ones! A few things I wish you could possibly add is the ability to change outgoing bubble color, it doesn't have to be as detailed as the incoming message, but at least choose between 3-4 different grays/white. Also I have issues with sending & receiving MMS. Other apps don't have an issue with me selecting the ""no compression"" option but this app will not work. My max is 10mb.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Fast, simple, easy not complex, ...needs group texting though at least with options. Other than that good secondary app until a little more options are available. Update: does group texting... had to press space key in the contact window after each entry...learn by trial and error. For some reason the voice messaging microphone didn't open until the second day after downloading. Changed rating to a 5.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is amazing, made even more so by the developer! When there is a bug (usually a result of Android updates) responses are extremely fast and updates are add well. Ideas and improvements are very fast, and the features are amazing! Group titles, color coding messages by contact (customizable of course), pinning messages so they don't get lost, those are my favorites. The only improvement I can suggest is notification sound based on contact (edit: individual contact, not conversation)",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"After trying it out a few days it seems a little slow when going into messages. Found the developer talking about the app on Reddit and decided to give it a try over Textra. The app is responsive and clean, no extra clutter everywhere. I really enjoy apps that do one or a few things well instead of trying to be the kitchen sink. Only features I really feel I need at present is making the color of the icon in the conversation list the same as the customized color (eg John is blue vs the default theme in both the conversation list and conversation itself), the ability to revert a customized contact to the default, and being able to go to the menu upon leaving settings instead of to the conversation list.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,William V.,"Works and has useful features. Only issue is the ""take photo"" picture-sending option on GBoard will not work on Pixel 3. I can, however, send any desired picture using the ""attach a photo"" option (again, on GBoard); it is a simple workaround. This open-source software is worthwhile. For my use, it is exceptionally functional yet simple, with a pleasant user interface.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Moe Azizi,"If you have issues good luck getting a response. Customer service doesn't exist. The app itself is decent but a few issues like if you start a text but have to answer the phone, you come back to finish it but there's no ""draft"" to let you know where you left off so you have to go through each text to find it. Also, the delivery notice is useless. Sometimes it works but most times it doesn't. So many other issues but minor ones.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Cassandra Meeker,"Was looking for a messaging app without gifs, which can be very inappropriate, but still had imoji's and no ads!!! This app is great! It runs smooth, seems to be compatible with other messaging services and has a smooth import contacts from previous service. Liked it enough to buy the full app for a really low price! Thank you QKSMS! PS; minor suggestions would be to add a text ""read"" feature along with the ""delivered"" that you already have and add the ability to change color of the owner text🙂",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Steve Atkinson,Tried this app because Samsung messenger's speech to text is terrible. This app's speech to text work quite well. The problem is that QKSMS's ability to send quality pictures as attachments is very bad. I don't why. I switched back to messenger and the very same pictures sent and received with the same quality as the camera took. Also I don't like paying for things that other apps offer fir free. Like message scheduling. For now I've gone back to messenger.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Sam Thomas,"Came here after years of using Signal but deleted my account and uninstalled after they removed SMS support. Saw a mention of this app in a reddit thread and gave it a shot. I've tried dozens of Android texting apps and this is my new favorite! Simple to use, clean interface, easy contact color customization, and ad-free. I loved Signal for it's layout and this comes the closest while even improving upon some things. So, thank you Signal for helping me find this app!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great so far! I've been playing with a variety of messaging apps and decided on this one. The super black mode is very welcome. I decided to pay the max donation to show support. The one thing I don't see is a way to send multiple pics at the same time. Other than that it checks all the boxes on my list of needs. Oh and I see the dev is actively responding to comments so that's awesome.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Colin Reimer,"I'm in love! As someone who is slowly trying to ditch Google services, I'm happy to report that this app is a wonderful alternative to Android Messages. The app interface is elegant and we'll thought out in terms of design. I would like to see a few gestures for reachablitly, possibly inspired by OneUI? It would make use on larger phones a dream. I'd also like it if I could swipe anywhere to the right to access the slide-out menu. It's location in the top corner is hard to reach.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Chuck Crombie,Today's update has made a mess of the app. Used to be great now it's lagging and crashing. Takes forever to open some conversations. Some don't open at all. Stock messaging app works fine. Installed the Google and Microsoft ones and they both work fine as well. Rebooted the phone and still the same issues. Don't know what you changed but change it back please.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been pleased with the changes in the app. My scheduled messages send every time, on time. My messages hardly send multiple times now. The only thing I could think would be implementing a ""mute"" setting to mute certain conversations. Other than that, it's been my favorite messaging app so far.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app was nice until it stopped sending texts right when I sent them. It told me delivered but my friend didn't get them until the next day. It was the same in the opposite direction. She would send something and I wouldn't get them until later. We were so confused. Also, my family sent me a pic which I never received. I never had any of these problems with other apps. I do like that when I sent pics it was really quick. Unfortunately because of the lag in sending and receiving texts I'm having to Uninstall this app. Makes me sad.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Design looks decent enough especially with the night mode. My only gripe, which is a pretty big one to me, is that you can't send video directly through this app. Only links... Also having constant issues sending pictures. These two issues are negating the usefulness of this app. If a fix happens soon I will update my review, otherwise this app will get deleted and dropped to 1 star... Realising the latest issue with sending pictures has only recently started after I upgraded to Plus...",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"What happened to my sweet, emoji-free app? It did an automatic update and *poof*...it all went crazy. I cannot send group text messages anymore, and the texts I send often go to the TOP of the previous message instead of the usual bottom of the previous message. Or, when I press the send button, the message I sent just disappears, so I have no idea if it was actually sent or not. What happened? I have restarted my phone, twice. My 3 daughters have the same app and their's did not update.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Corey Lewis,"Easy to use but very laggy. The app takes four seconds from the time I hit send on a text until it appears on screen. Additionally, switching between chats is a painfully slow process, as it seems it has to reload the conversation from scratch each time. Archiving all but two chats didn't even help matters. This isn't usable on my Galaxy A01.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Schmonko The Clown,This had potential at one time. It really doesn't stop spam messages with Should I Answer. Also making it the default just doesn't work when sending attached photos. I finally had to uninstall this app as it can't do what it claims. And when sending attached photos I have to make Message+ the default. QKSMS was a great goal at one time - but it too was pretty much all bark and no bite.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I would give it five stars but when I first started using, I couldnt save contacts from this app. The latest update seems to have fixed that. However, with that fix/update seems there is a new bug that's not allowing me to send photos. I have force closed the app and restarted my phone, to no avail. Seems this started when the app updated a few days ago. Bummer. Looking for a new app as we have a newborn and sending photos is a must!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Loving this app! I switched when the default messages app got rid of individual colors for each person's message bubbles and made my outgoing messages blue instead of grey (I like having incoming messages be colorful). I love the pure black dark mode since it's nice for OLED screens. Messages seem to send a lot quicker than the stock Android messages too and I don't get any failed to send notifications like I used to. One issue I am having is that my contacts don't update new numbers that text me even after I add them to my contacts, but otherwise things have been smooth.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I rarely write reviews, unless an app is exceptional. This is one of the best apps I've used, period. Smooth, fast, & clean. I also really appreciate the quick reply function & that there are no ads. I plan on upgrading as soon as I can afford to. This app says it will make you love texting again, and quite frankly, it's accurate. I used to avoid replying to people bc my previous texting apps were slow, clunky, & loaded with ads. Now I am able to keep in better contact with my family! Thank you!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Thus far this is a very good app. Though as a previous reviewer mentioned, I find the groups listed at the top of the recipient list rather than individuals when creating a new text to be a hassle. I do have quite a few groups defined in my contacts. So, a means to eliminate them from the list, or, even better, order them at the bottom of the list would be a big improvement to me.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App seems to work well but it has a very Annoying Notification Issue. When you set the main Notification sound from the main settings it doesn't apply that sound to new messages so you have to go in and set each message thread to the desired notification sound.  Reply: Thanks for the quick reply however I fully understand how the custom sounds work and how to apply them the issue is when I set the main notification sound in the app all of the new messages I create default back to the default sound that was there when I downloaded the app (it pulls the default notification sound set on my phone that is used across all the other apps) If this is still not clear if you have an email I can send you some screenshots of the problem. PS I found your email so I will send you screenshots.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Andrew Paradiso,"Works surprisingly well for an app that's no longer maintained for over a year. It's clean, simple, and does what it needs to do. A small donation unlocks a few extra customizations. Thankfully it's open source, so anyone can continue where the developer left off if they wish.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Jeff Gunderson,Stable and full featured. Switched to after experiencing deteriorating stability with Google Messages and after having tried a few other options that turned out to lack pretty basic features. Best sms app I've tried. A couple minor things thst would be nice are 1) ability to search within a single conversation and 2) ability to view an attached photo before sending. But again minor things compared the superior operation compared to most other messaging apps.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"seems to be a very nice looking alternative to googles messages app. BUT I can't send GIFS at normal quality. They get really blurry and small for other people. Also something I'd love to see in the app is that in group chats, the individual contacts involved have different colors attached to them. Preferably the ones assignment in their individual chats. 😁😁",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've always switched from messenger to messenger, trying to find the perfect one. This is it. It's just as clean as Google messages, as customizable as Textra, and as intuitive as the both of them. It's not overloaded with useless features either. This is a fast, pretty, and simple messenger, with nothing to dislike.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"-snip- Original review about pictures not sending which was solved - Update: just noticed the reply and tried the solution and it worked! Thanks. Update #2: I've had to revert back to another sms app as texts messages failed to send to certain phone numbers ""This message to *name* failed to send."" An odd problem but an important one.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Cristobal Rendon,"I've been using this app for a solid 3 months now and the experience hits all my needs. No sending errors, images look full when sent, well organized. I've definitely been convinced to pay for this. Based on my understanding, it only uses SMS and MMS, no RCS yet. It's not google and that is what matters to me. Works well with open board as an alternative to the stock Samsung keyboard and messaging app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Scott Biggs,"Some features are nice, but I only use a few of them. Compared to the built-in messaging app, this is a little clunky. But the biggest problem is the memory usage. This app hogs so much, that it squeezes out all other apps, making switching between frequently used apps impossible. For me, this is a deal breaker. Update: Seems they have considerably reduced the size of this app, so I'm upping my review to 4 stars. Thanks! Now if I could find some decent docs, I'd be completely happy.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,R P,"I liked QKSMS even with the bugs. I contacted the developer via email 5 times. Waited 4 weeks. NOT ONE REPLY. Nothing on the web for support either. It is obvious this app is no longer supported. This version in the Play Store is from February 24, 2021. Nothing new since. I uninstalled QKSMS and had to find something else for messaging. I could not continue to use QKSMS with the bugs, as they are too severe to live with. Fix the bugs and this app could be one of the most popular messaging apps available.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Ethan Shenfeld,"I love this app. I was looking for an ad-less and customizable messaging app and this has ticked all my boxes. The app offers a litnay for customizable colors, notification settings, messaging settings and a bunch of other things too. The app offers AMOLED black as the background too which is nice. The blocking feature is really nice and unique too. I am considering donating to the app development too. Would highly recommend. Only issue is sending photos larger than 11mb. Using on OnePlus 8.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like it so far, but the only drawback compared to Mood or the default is the lack of on screen notifications. Those apps have the bubble that can appear on your screen to let you know you have messages. Since this app doesn't have it, I tend to miss messages from people. Other than that it's pretty good.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,James Wadsley,"Was looking for a replacement for Textra, because even in 2021 they still can't archive text messages. I like this app so far, only wish you could customize more. Like increase the text font size in a text message without making the whole application text bigger, or customize the outgoing text message background, instead of a boring old grey. Emailed the developer, may update my review if / when he gets back to me",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the schedule message for later option! I haven't seen that since Chomps, i use this feature constantly for work!

Sold!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Larry Nevada,"I really like the app. But - I used it a week with no issues. Starting yesterday I cannot send an image. Nothing was changed, it just quit sending pics. I attach it and tap send and it just disappears as if I pressed a cancel button. No response to my request for help. I uninstalled & reinstalled with no change.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the clean UI and especially the widget. BUT, it frequently gets into a state where it won't allow me to 1. create a new conversation, or 2. pick an existing conversation. I'm on Moto G5S Plus, Android 8.1.0 and have no touchscreen issues other than with this app. Haven't been able to diagnose when this glitching starts occurring. (Update) It stops responding to my touches - I can see that the touch ""registers"" (because it momentarily flickers), but nothing happens.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Brad Bigam,"The app works really well. I don't know why but all of a sudden I'm getting Google microphone instead of the microphone that I used to get. Did that happen with the update? Cuz I hate Google microphone. It stops randomly and etcetera. I looked in settings to see if I could switch it, but I couldn't find anything.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Not only do I love the look of this app, but I love that I can customize my conversations with diffrent colours. I don't mind the slow updates, since it is 100% ad free. I cannot wait for the future ideas to be in updates. I like the way it is going. My only quip is I think it might have slowed my phone down slightly. At least, compared to the default message app on my phone. But I'm willing to settle on that for using this app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Mr Leon (The Specialist),"I love the app , I am very happy with it .some suggestions for future development: a little tab to pull down in conversation, that has mini calender in it . So it can jump to that day . Maybe search box also in individual conversation ? Categories and trash would be nice also .great app Ps: almost forgot , only thing i dont like is . To.many options when inserting pictures .it shows all app .maybe have gallery as default would be better .having 3-4 is a bit much.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Chris Zolman,"Really great but has a weird glitch. When I start a text to someone from scratch that wasn't in my inbox before, it'll send the text but when they respond, it'll be in a different thread. Both threads have their name on it, so I have to switch to the one they replied on. And later when my inbox is full of other people, and I don't want to search for them, I'll start another text from scratch and it'll write in the first thread (which only has my initial texts. Not their responses) Very annoying",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The interface is rather beautiful! I've been using for months. Much functional than the vanilla messaging app. It could be better by enhancing the spam blocking function. Currently it only supports blocking by number but it only covers US. If localized spam providers are not possible, maybe adding blocking by regrex of content is a shortcut.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Hanna May,"Overall a pretty good messaging app. Clean UI. I have difficulty with MMS messages. I've changed the setting for no compression, automatic compression, compression to 2mb, regardless of setting pictures don't send at times. Not sure the issue. Otherwise good messaging app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Jeff Ruebel,"Intuitive, well-organized and attractive interface. Good features. I tried QKSMS because it opens URLs in texts in the browser of my choice (Messages forces them to open in the useless built-in browser) and I ended up finding it to be an all around better app than Messenger and several others I've tried.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Kado,"Nearly perfect messaging app to replace Android SMS and my default messager. The only issues I've had are backing out of the app and going back mid message, and the position I was previously typing in was moved to BEFORE my message, as well as messages/images not loading after sending a message and or backing out and backing in. Customization and colors are beautiful and the UI is easy and nice. Wish there was a text search feature like Android MS but hopefully devs have some expansion to do!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Houston,"Really enjoying this app so far. Aesthetics are super important to me and this app visually looks great! Reasonably customizable, especially in color settings. It's fast and responsive, and comes with all the features I care about. The only thing I miss from Pulse SMS is the desktop messaging capability. Otherwise, everything I want is here and works great! ZERO issues with MMS so far too! Photos send quickly and are somehow HIGHER quality than my prior app?! Using a Galaxy S10. 9.5/10 so far",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Well I can't complain...works with my call control pro license and it actually shows the pics on my Galaxy phone while the stupid stock app doesn't. Listen guys... great job so far. Keep up the good work. 👍 Update:. I have to come down on my review bc you guys really need to allow audio and video like the stock app on Samsung. I have to swap back and forth in order to do this.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I purchaed the upgrade to support development and for the delay sending option, as QKSMS does what it does well and shows potential. I rated the app 4 stars, because I was disappointed that the delay feature only works with SMS and does not work with MMS. With delay send on MMS, I would give 5 stars. On a positive note this is one of the few Play Store message apps that will send MMS from the OnePlus 6t on the Verizon network.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I absolutely love this app. I spent a long time looking for an sms app and was about to code one myself until I stumbled upon this. It's a very clean and beautiful UI and it does everything you expect from a texting app. The only reasons I'm giving this a 4 star is because I would like to see in-app media selection (along with videos being allowed) and maybe more group messaging settings like send individually to all and sms/mms toggles.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Loving the app and transitioning into making it my daily driver. Super appealing aesthetic and the dark modes are A1. Maybe in the future, link previews could be added as well as having favorite/starred contacts appear first for new messages /sharing. Also displaying recent photos when sharing a photo within a conversation would be a nice add. Great job overall 💪🏾",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Aislynn Dynna,"this app is great for messaging, super fast and simple. the customization options are minimalistic and satisfying. however, recently there was an update that put a time receipt above every new received message in the conversation. i don't really like this feature and otherwise i would have continued to use the app. if it would be possible to create a setting where one can choose whether or not to display a time receipt with every received message, i would definitely give this app 5 stars.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Darcy Moore,"I purchased this app as I liked its clean uncluttered interface, and I wanted to use its advanced features, such as scheduled messaging. It was disappointing, first, to find there was no repeat option for scheduled messaging and second, I later realised it was not sending scheduled messages at all. I made certain it had all the necessary privileges, and that I was only sending text messages. (Mms will only send when the data is switched on). This makes it unreliable, and rather less useful than many of its competitors.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like this app for its simplicity and reliability. One thing that bothers me is the text background in incoming messages in night mode. It's hard to read, at least to me... OK, I think I've found the reason. I set up a night mode and the theme was not dark enough, hence the incoming message background became brighter so the contrast between fonts and background was weaker. My mistske",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Pretty straightforward so far. I like the efficient design. Currently what I feel the app' lacks the most is the possibility to group all the notifications (like automatic/confirmation messages) in a single 'folder' because they can take quite a bit of space. Also adding the possibility to automatically delete them after X time (if read) for both security purpose and saving space.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Northwest,"I'm enjoying the simplicity of this ad-free app and the fact that it's open source but there are also some design features that I appreciate.

Disappointed to see that no option to choose the backup save location, it only uses emulated sdcard (internal storage), and defaults to a folder marked QKSMS.  Pretty pointless as this would be wiped during a factory reset, and offers zero benefit for those who have a physical sdcard slot. Much better would be the ability to choose a location, so the physical sdcard can be selected.",3

Aside from that this app has great customization, an excellent backup system and all the quick reply/mark as read tools I use. It does not support RCS but that is to be expected since Google is running that out of their own servers. BUT if you just need a great and transparent open source SMS app this is the one to use.

However it shows the message in the conversation before sending.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Padua Play,Glad to see an update. Still love the app. Worth paying for and did. But even the recent update 3.9.2 has performance issues. Hangs when typing + to compose a new sms and then any number or character - apparently the app hangs while looking up the contact database. This issue was already there in previous versions. The phone has about 2600 contacts and about 30 sms'. Even the stock Google Messages app does not hang! (just to compare). Request the developer to fix this ASAP. Thanks.,3

Unless you can personalise it like a few other apps so that you can have different signatures for different people then it is purposeless to most of us.

Now I can create my own ""OLED mode""(heavy use of true blacks) to not only not blind myself at night, but also for battery savings since true blacks actually turns off the portion of an OLED screen. A secondary concern was privacy/transparency - I've seen too many stories where closed-source applications mine your data and nefariously embed themselves deep into your phone's OS, and Google already has so much of my data. With QKSMS being ad-free and open-source, my messages are one less thing I have to worry about Google selling for advertisement. I've been a long-time user, and remember a lot of little bugs popping up, but upon reflection I haven't had a single issue with my newest phone (OnePlus 6), so development has come a long way too.

com.moez.QKSMS,Slumber Foxie,"I have known your app since 2016 but finally decided to use it and by God, it was disappointing,not what I known from others who used it. No read all messages option, no pinning of top messengers or messages (it's a feature of Google messages), and of the one that most disappointed me was of backup and restore option which is locked in premium. If I had known, I wouldn't used it. Premium should be icing, not the cake. Plus consider making an app for dialer, caller ID & contacts all in one. 👍",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Rob,"I've tried so many paid versions of SMS and I can only speak from my experience when I say QKSMS is perfect for me, has everything I need especially when it comes to scheduled text messages and pop notification on my screen for new messages as I wasn't getting with many others but could be my smartphone. The only thing I'm not sure as of yet if this has or diesi us end to end encryption which I don't believe it has and not a deal breaker, I do simple texting and it's perfect..Paid Version",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great for texting, but really frustrated when trying to attach it share pics. It almost never works. I'm looking for another app as it's so annoying and disappointing, because otherwise this app has a great set up and design and it's really clean and easy to use.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Dennis Wando,"An amazing, lightweight app that does what it ought to - texting - really well. The free version has virtually all I need. It has a sufficient number of customizations though not as in depth as other comparable apps. It doesn't bog you down though even with add-ons.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like the look and feel of it but I uninstalled it because I really depend on having 10 preset responses. On messages with three recipients it would help to have each recipient have a different color of text. I'll check again in a few months and reconsider installing it then.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Had an issue with pictures not sending but the recommendation for compression size selection worked! Thanks support team! Just a wish list of features: - timestamps displayed on all messages - check marks to denote delivery receipts and/or messages read - option for custom backgrounds - option to change appearence of text bubbles - more customization in general,4
com.moez.QKSMS,KMM Zaman,Something is good but there is no 'Mark all as read' option. For that we have to read all masseges one by one to mark all massege as read this is very annoying. Also there are much problem while i send a sms to dual or more number of a same contact. I have to send that type of message individualy to a person who have more than one number. Group massege does not sent individualy so that we cannot see delivery report in every masseges easily.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Lightweight and looks amazing too. Would love the option to toggle random colors for contacts but otherwise fantastic! Edit: Shows developer does listen to feedback. This feature has been added now and this is by far my most recommended sms app now. Free, open source, and just beautiful and gets the job done perfectly.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,De Mins,"Worked great for past 2 years on S9 ... Few months ago started having occasional lengthy transmission times with and sporadically not receiving incoming messages. Recently, the slow transmission issues started occurring almost constantly... We're talking about a simple ""OK"" reply... Yesterday, couldn't send messages at all, after hitting send, message would disappear from box and never delivered to recipient. Finally had to switch back to Samsung messenger app.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Jennifer Melo,would be nice to be able to change the colour of text bubble of sent messages when using either dark mode or light mode. Also having the option of sent sound for when messages send would be great. Would also like the option to mute certain messages. Lagging messages including mms by 5 days please fix. To be able to send over 2mb mms messages and for them to be clear.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Excellent app! I love that it's open source but also updated and managed very tightly. The app is clean and functional. Highlights include dark theme, scheduled message sending and backup options (the last two are for the paid version). Thank you!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Fast client. But can not send test that is 2 messages long. Like you type more than one message worth of text in one message it cannot break it up and send it in 2 it will fail.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"as others have mentioned I too am very impressed with the speed and cleanliness of the app. matching received bubbles to a chosen contact color. the one bug I have noticed is receiving a message from a contact that has been blacklisted, still populates the notification on the home screen icon. G7 Android 9.0 with MS launcher. edit... on single sms thread make the contact color with no picture match the bubble color,dont know why icon notification home scrn shows in blacklist contact ons launcher",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So far, so good. Clean and sleek design with great additional free features over most other SMS apps. I havent explored plus yet, but at least try the free version when thinking of switching to other SMS apps. The dev seems to be very communicative too which is fantastic.",5

App had recently updated and my bugs have been resolved and the problems all fixed!! Thank you so much I really am happy with the quick response - great app! Customizable and much better than standard messaging app on the phone,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Nowshad Ahmed,"The app is great in terms of looks and general usage. The best feature I like is the popup customisation, so I can delete unwanted sms as soon as it comes. And so 3 stars. As for the missIng 2 stars, the app doesn't seem to sync previous sms and doesn't show sms prior to using this app. Synching option doesn't do anything, rather clears the messages from this app. The messages are still available in default app but not shown here.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Doug Clark,"Call Control suggested QKSMS, and it's been pretty good. But something ""magical"" would be the ability to block email-to-text spams by domain. I emailed an inquiry about it, but never got a reply about if it's even possible on Android. I don't know anyone who would text me from any Hotmail address, and I'm tired of pornospams at 4:00 AM. Update: I'm reducing the rating to two stars because of the lack of response, and searching for a different messaging app.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Has almost every feature I want (archive, themes, scheduling). The only issue is often MMS images will fail. The app won't event attempt to send them, even if the compression limit is off. Only flaw, but it's a major one.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love love love this messenger app. Thin, light and has all the features that I need. The reason I started looking at messenger apps is because Verizon's messenger app was too huge and bulky for me to want to deal with. I found QKSMS several years ago and haven't looked back. When I have had problems, which is rare, emailing the support email gets a quick response and the developer is lovely. He can usually solve the issue in an email or two. Can't recommend this app highly enough. Perfect",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Samsung Galaxy S8, Pie 9.0.0 - QKSMS works great!  I really like this app as it is light on resources, has a simple well laid out interface, no ads and is open source.  Other SMS apps I tried felt bloated and over featured.  QKSMS is very fast and has the features that I need on a daily basis.  I used this app for less than an hour and then purchased the + version.  I did not need any of the + version features but I wanted to support the developer for building this nice app.  My thanks to the developer for a simple well laid out app that works great.  Job well done!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the app's clean interface and ease of use. I wished there are more customization options nonetheless, it's great! 😊 Edit: I would love to see the option of changing bubbles and the color of the bubbles (gradient, perhaps?)",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The best sms app out there. Simple and customizable. And the developer is very generous. There are no ads and none of the important features are restricted to premium. If I used it more than once every other month I would definitely pay the very reasonable one-off £2.59.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Mark Young,"I really like this app, however, I can't find a ""Mark all as Read"" function. It seems that if I have several messages to mark as read I need to long press the first one, and select each of the others before selecting ""Mark as Read"". If I am missing something I would like to know. This feature would be a welcomed addition. Otherwise, I am very happy with the app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Good so far. Latest version improves message blocking and has helped keep the spammers down, just click block and you won't see the spammer again. I would seriously get at least 43 spams a day which made it difficult for me to tell good mesages from bad and it just takes a quick click and you're good to go. Love the QKSMS+features like Scheduled messages and Automatic night mode and my favorite is blocking so far and it's free. I'm already getting a better messaging experince.Try it for free.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,joel moore,Love the app and customization. 2 issues 1. Can't send video 2. Sometimes pictures will say they didn't not send but do send. Or if I try to send out a picture to a group of people it works correctly on their end but on mine I see multiple sent to one person and nothing to the others.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, just need archive functionality for the notification action buttons. Also, the reply overlay is horrific on my screen it is far too small and the keyboard cuts off what you are typing. Perhaps do a full screen mode option for smaller devices.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app. However since Amdroid 10 was loaded no notification of texts appear on screen as they did before. Just notification icon in the tray. I like to have the text appear and be able to reply immediately. Hope it is put back in the next update.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I have used many sms apps but this one is just love. One can schedule its sms. Backup and restore is also available (on purchasing). Themes are also good. * Improvements* : There is room for improvement also. You should add coustom bubble colors and shapes in the conversation. Over all app is the best. 5/5,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Not bad, but it could be better. I like the uncluttered appearance, compared to the stock android 9 app. 5 STARS if you update with the following features: 1. Allow 'lock message' so that when a conversation is deleted the locked messages remain. 2. Ask to include the signature and 3. allow storage of several, different signatures. 4. Theme colour selected for a conversation should be applied to the inbox icon. 5. Allow conversions to be 'flagged' as important with an icon.",3

But Qksms wouldn't always receive messages from my contacts and never accepted texts from 2fa sources, unless my phone was awake and opened to the Qksms app. I could live with the latter but not the former, after missing key texts telling me about changes in plans. So my search for a non invasive texting program continues.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,revenant567,"I've paid for this app because I used to use it all the time and I wanted to support it, but for some reason, you can't text MMS videos anymore, you can only send SMS and MMS pictures. I only want one app for SMS/MMS, and this app can't do all basic funtions, and until it can again, my rating stays",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Does what I need better than the stock messaging app, especially like the ability to select multiple messages to delete within a conversation.

Recently I've noticed alot of sending lag and failing to send messages it's Not my phone company its the software. Reinstall fixed until backup was restored. Once restored diagnostics showed qksms database was larger that is set to allow. So either increase the size for everyone or make it a setting for qksms+. I have x2 sims each other there own messages dating back 2 to 3 years. 5 star tyvm,5

Why did this happened and how can i fix this? Now it doesn't show any count so i'm kinda curious. A little help? This is the best messaging app around. I've tried so many messaging apps that were so complicated to use, but QKSMS is the simpliest, practical and good looking. Kudos to the creator(s) of QKSMS. Will purchase the additional features soon.",5

Have even tweaked around with the MMS limit with no luck.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Dotdot.,By far the best texting app except for a recent problem I've been having where I can't send uncompressed MMS like everyone else says. You have to compress it down to a terrible quality in order to send. It says 'failed' repeatedly unless you do. Other apps like Textra can send uncompressed MMS perfectly fine.,2

I had to copy the text of the message to send it. I cannot long-press phone numbers to copy them in QKSMS. Also, QKSMS is missing all of the history with the number 7726. I hope it hasn't deleted anything. I have to use QKSMS now because I'm inundated with a dozen spam messages every day.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really nice app. I was looking for an alternative for Android sms app and it's definitely worth a look. Two things that would make it perfect for me: adding option to hide the sim card toggle next to sms input, I never use the other cars actually and I already accidentally changed it. And the other one: an option to open an incoming msg in a modal window after you click on it from push notifications. Right now it opens the whole app, it only shows in the modal window if the screen is awake.",5

There are no obtrusive adds, nearly all the options you could want are free, but I'm excited for some of the future updates, particularly the auto-emoji button they'll eventually have as I use a keyboard without emojis and having to switch back and forth between my favored keyboard and the native one is a pain.",5

The group sms switch was off, it still sent out to all on my list, Not the contract I highlighted to be sent. The flaw in this app needs urgent attention quickly!.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,love this app and the continued development love the scheduling of messages and the theming options. love the all black mode and how smooth this app is. i love that it doesn't drain your battery much at all. love that it's open source. i would say the thing i want most is online messaging so i can text from my Mac. making conversations private with a passcode required to open them would be pretty amazing as well. thanks developer!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,LOVE this app for texting. Purchased premium in the first hour no joke. suggestion for future updates: adding a quick reply feature!

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"QKSMS+ is much improved from last decade – and far superior to my previous SMS app. It has all the necessary core features (except see below); has a beautiful UI; and is fast and reliable. However, it contains one deficiency – and it's a bad one. NO SUPPORT FOR MMS! You can send photos using MMS (but photos sent via MMS are shrunk to the size of a postage stamp); and the app is restricted to strictly allowing photos. This is preposterous. It needs to be fixed ASAP!",3

Thumbs up to the devs!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Igor Kevorkov,"Good sms client, the only downside for me is the delete button location.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This App is really Nice but somethings not right. Could you fix the landscape Mode with swift key it does.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Bought the premium version so that I could export SMS from my old phone. Again bought the premium version so I could import SMS in my new phone.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's a very well designed and full of material goodness, but i just wanna say that could you move the info from the sidebar into settings because it makes the app look very odd Edit: i wish that you move the things that require pro in settings and also the banner to purchase pro, will make the app look more seamless",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Grebulon com,It's a nice an functional SMS app and I love that it's open source. Feature request: option to notify only on messages from contacts in the contact list and/or incoming numbers that are already received and were not blocked. This will reduce distraction from spam.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Kat Nolan,"I love QKSMS. It's a clean interface with the extras you want in an SMS app - themes and pin-to-top. And to get the full feature list for only $3 is fantastic. And NO ADS, even if you don't upgrade. Thank you!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Tech 1on1,"Great messenger but decided to stay on stock .. paid to test premium features and was surprised that can't refund in 10 minutes, and all premium did was basically more theme options that was useful..

I through I'll get that buying premium.",2

com.moez.QKSMS,mcubed,"This is for sure a very reliable, well designed and thought out SMS app. This is the first app I paid for premium because it functions so much better than textra, mood, google messages, chomp and several others that I have used extensively which all had the same repetitive errors and none hold a candle to QKMS. It may not have fancy themes but the simplicity is honest and I like it a lot.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,PLEASE can you add the options to allow/disallow read receipts and typing notifications! That's all this app is missing. By default it's set to allow and people don't need to know if I'm typing and if I've read their message.......,4

com.moez.QKSMS,Concerned Human Man,I like the app. Two things missing. Muting the group messages. A big deal. And GIFs. Those two features are in Textra. Whats taking so long devs?? FYI. I had to uninstall this version and find the apk for a much older version so that attachments would send.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice App.. Keepup the good work.. A minor change in Copy Text option will help needs as It can only copy whole sms not its selective part..

I turn my phone off every night. Running android 9 on dual sim blackview 9900 phone. Not sure if i have disabled something i shouldn't have..? It is enabled as my sms app in the settings.

Please let me know what I'm doing wrong!?,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Smooth app but I have the full version and I'm still having issues sending out mms. The regular message app send out message and this can't. Also switching default app take too long. Once this mms issue is resolve it would be nice to be able to text videos.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My favorite messaging app! It does everything I need, from customization to scheduled messages, and the app is smooth as silk. Kudos to the developer for this beautiful and functional work of art!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The screen doesn't wakeup for incoming messages. In the silent mode it is a trouble to get notified about incoming messages because of that. Please fix that problem to wakeup the screen. Good job anyway.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Linda Houston,Stopped sending images. I tried a file compression app and it still didn't work. I'm now using the message app that came installed on the phone with no issues.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"On S8 when old sms synced from stock app none of my own sent messages got transferred. Received sms ok. I paid full version, but I don't enjoy the app for this reason. Update: the issues still remains unresolved. Resync didn't help.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,William Houser,"Love this app. Love that it's proper GPL open source. The only reason I didn't give it four stars is that it doesn't as far as I can tell offer the ability to send a voice audio message which is a feature I really need because I drive for a living. Add that, and I'll be sorted for life.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Jon A,"Simple but great app. But, I hope to have the option to PIN or mark as FAVORITE some messages, so that they will be more easily accessible on top of the list, all the time. Then it will be more worth paying for. Thanks and great work!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Works...it works great with Should I Answer to help filter spam and junk texts. But it does a terrible job with GIF images that most of us like to use for messaging. Makes them all big and fuzzy.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like the simplicity of this app, it is quite elegant. My only complaint is that in dark mode my own chat bubbles do not have a background or outline, they are just white text on the black theme.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Lőrinc Bethlenfalvy,"You should indicate in the description that backup/restore is a premium feature, I installed the app mainly for that. Actually, for least surprise I'd suggest you upload a menu screenshot of the free version so that the OKSMS+ labels are visible.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Bruce Carlson,"It is time to retire this app! The last time this app was updated was mid-January. Hundreds of bugs have been found and there is no answer from the developer. Call Control keeps pushing this app but IT DOESN'T WORK! IT DOESN'T BLOCK TEXTS! And it's full of bugs. We reported nearly a dozen and NOTHING! Others have reported theirs and NOTHING! Not even sure this developer still even exists! Call Control: Do your customers right! Quit recommending this and YOU block texts, please!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like that it is open source. The scheduler is the most important feature for me. This app does not do emojis, which is a big drawback. If they added access to emojis, it would be 5 stars. On ads, ever - this is great!",4

com.moez.QKSMS,mccoolemomma,This won't block spam texts AT ALL!! I have it integrated with call control but still I'm being bothered all day long with spam. Why is it so hard to create a text blocking app. I have yet to find one that will actually work. I know people will pay a good price for one that will work. All these are doing is clogging up my phone!!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,ei,it looks really nice!!! and the messaging is fast!! its just a super simple sms app and it works great :) you can change the theme from normal to night mode to pure black and you can also change the accent colors,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Charles Jutkins,I mostly really love this app. The one little bug is sometimes a message cannot be deleted as it get's past QKsms and some how lands in the android messenger cache. I would delete messenger but it's one of those built in apps and even though it's and unlocked phone it won't let me delete messenger. The only way I can delete the messeage is to make messenger the default app then switch back to QKsms. Anybody got a solution? I am going to try of force stop on messenger for the time being and see if that works.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Dennis Bielefield,"So is pretty good in that you can block texts, but has issues sending while on WIFI and to groups. I've had to switch back to the default texting app a few times to send some texts.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's ok. Sometimes it doesn't send emojis...it either doesn't send them at all or takes minutes for them to go through. Other texts will go through first even though I send them after the ones with the emojis in them.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Sheetza S,"ANOTHER DEVELOPER ABANDONED THEIR APPLICATION. If you are wondering why theres no support, it's because the developer abandoned this project .....with no warning, no nothing! I know it's a free app, a really great sms application. But in my opinion, the fact that the dev drops it, leaving so many users hanging is wrong. If happens so often. SMH",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Annie Minnick,Good for MMS and very long text messages. They aren't broken up like SMS. . But not good at all for sending pictures. They almost always fall to send even the lowest resolution.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice / and had just what I was looking for widget so I can have it on the main screen when texting makes it nicer when you're led doesn't work for all your messages and some cell phones that don't have the ID to tell you you had something or Miss hit this helps.,5

(Ms. Frankie),"Liked it at first very convenient that it blocked ask those spam text messages but then my after a few days my own contacts weren't getting messages I sent them and vis versa... changed settings, Uninstalled app twice and still has this bug so im uninstalling and I'll just put up with the spam text!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really good app. Has a lot of useful features. I'm used to Textra and this is on par with that. The only things I miss are an option for a sent sound and chat color/style customizations.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,Ansley “Ans” Niles,"Impressive texting app but one major flaw, this app has a problem sending pictures to a recipient.. You have to try multiple times and it doesn't matter about using Mobile Data or Wifi either. This is what deters me from using the app.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really like this texting app. I get all my messages without delays or issues like the factory app on my phone. There are no ads. I can customize it and I couldn't be happier.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app and I love it because it is open source. Is there any chance there will be a Linux desktop application for it? I am using Pulse right now, but I would gladly switch to QKSMS if this were to happen.

I will 100% subscribe to pro version soon. App is being made by a single developer and his work so far is impressive. Amazing job!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Yogavacara Siddhattha,It does support two SIM. 1. When any message arrives it doesn't show which sim have received it 2. It doesn't has one option like Silence sms app by showing two ticks that it doesn't show wether receivers has received message.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Glenn Grahl (Lil' Joker),Blocking is half and half Ability to search for keywords doesn't exist which is a feature most sms have (however not this app) although the ability to block text but not impede them coming in and being archived is great I feel this app has much to be discussed to make it a top notch user friendly application.,2

Such as ernest! I am not ernest and yet I get hundreds of texts for this person ALL FROM DIFFERENT NUMBERS THAT DONT EXIST! It's a form harassment and should be illegal!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love the look and feel of this app. The inbox is so streamlined for simplicity and it has many features still in the works but everyone should give this app a good try.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Peter Buraczewski,"Hi I had loaded this app after having trouble on my other device, receive texts sms claiming bitcoin links to internet sites ,using random number generator and I had alot of money to collect before it's lost Tu keys ! I had should I answer , but they gave me free access too this one on my other device , ,which on this device I also apply I must pay approx $7,00 ? Well I think it's going tobe worth my effort to buy a subscription on this device also to get all them good colored features",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Robert S,It's a nice app and works well. The one thing that's missing that I wish it had was a notification telling me when I get a text while I'm talking on the phone . I wish they would add that. If it had that feature I would give it five stars,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Lina žinutė,Literally the same as another app named Messages with a yellow letter icon. So I'm not sure who's copying from who but at least in that other app all the features are free. And here you have to pay even for the night mode.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Melissa Smith,Only giving it one star because I had to to write the review. It's horrible when I finally got it to install. I tried getting ride of the adds and get the other fetures it accepted payment but nothing changed. I deleted it and was told I didn't get a refund even tho I never received what I paid for. Horrible. Don't use,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Rich Braverman,"When texting, unless your keyboard supports emojiis, you're outta. Also you can not attach a file to the text, yiu have go find it THEN share it with qksms. Fix those and it gets at least another star.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Dont waste your money. if you want customizations with a ton of features textra is your app. this app used to have lots of customizations but now its a slimmed down version.

Keep up the hard work and if you need beta testers or people with opinions (I'm sure you're not lacking that in today's society) let me know; I am full of ideas and research! 😊,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice but fix the bug where some messages take forever to send and the bug where messages fail to send sometimes when your connected on wifi. Thanks,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Hello, could you add an option to copy the OTP from the notification (2 factor authentication), like most sms apps do. I'd love to see it implemented here. Love from India. ❤️",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice app. Simple and fast. Only request that I have is: Can you give us the option to have the backup saved to an external card and/or google drive? Thanks.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Rohit Digraskar,No particular text selection allowed. Copies entire message. That's what I was looking for.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Sunshine_water,"Had to download this because of the ""should I answer"" app. So that it can BLOCK all texts NOT STORED IN CONTACTS. Well... It doesnt work. Same features as my phone comes with. Manually blocking...",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Raoul Castaneda (Demersal),This app has stopped all spam messages instantly. I set it so only people in my contact list get in. Spring for the tiny payment and get all the tools.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,John Geiss,Does NOTHING. They claim to stop spam messages but I'm sure they sd my info because now I receive twice the messages. Sure you can choose to block numbers but my phone already does that. This app itself is a scam,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Mool Tittle,"Like a lot of apps: Once was really good, then turned into bloatware, now all it does is crash. Uninstall.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Edit: Paid version has some great options. Got a response from the developer. Waiting. But so far, I like. Why does it show 2 messages when I only have one new one?",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"After few days this app doesnt work. I can't send the message "" Failed to send.Tap to try again"" How to fix it???? I reinstulled the app...but it doesnt help.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,One of the best messaging app I've used! I want to give this a 5 star if it has a feature of private message and the user can choose or customize the vibrate pattern.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Bob Smith,Works as described. The only downside is messages can't be read while hooked up to my vehicle's bluetooth.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"very average app, cannot change wallpaper seems like a no brainer to have this option. pop-up won't show on lock screen. premium gives some extra colors not worth it. wasted mu money",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I download this app because it looks to be a great one so I upgraded and it did not open all of the upgraded version I believe it sucks and I want a full refund thank you.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Awesome! Cool UI. Not overloaded with useless features. First time I actually purchased a pro version for an app. Worth it. Hopefully they add chat heads soon.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,dacube1,"Good. Able to use no matter what phone the other person has. Only problem is that to upgrade, they ask for your password to the phone service account you have. I don't give out passwords.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Imtiaz Shafi,Please add the features if possible 1. Option to copy part of text from a received message. 2. On double tapping a message gives its zoomed view i.e. single message with bigger font. Thanks,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So far so good. I just started using it and paid for +. The only thing I noticed is that the delivery reports aren't being returned. Another app did, so it's not my carrier. I'll see how it goes. Otherwise good.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Elsa Oliveros,It's almost perfect for me.I only wish there's an option to change background lighter than blue/black and darker than white.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Cool app but I find one issue particularly irritating. If more than one sms are sent in quick succession the latter msgs are not sent. Can you fix this ?,3
com.moez.QKSMS,J Boohoo,"Rubbish App!! It DOES NOT Block Spam Texts! The blocking component SUCKS~ IT IS NON EXISTENT! With in 24hrs got 4 spam text from people that were not in my contacts! Yes, i have it set up to use QKSMS blocking; but Nowhere Does it state What its blocking!",1

com.moez.QKSMS,Malan B,Issues with MIUI 13 on redmi note 10 pro. Not able to receive any SMS when this was the default app. I liked the quick view and color coding SMS into categories,2
com.moez.QKSMS,Matt Zook,Photo management in the app is no longer working. I used to be able to tap on the photos and they would open bigger. Now they don't. This is frustrating. Can we get this fixed?,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The one time I used this app, it sent the texts to the wrong contact. Was super annoying and would give a 0 out of 5 if possible.",1

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Same shi... as google messanger. In some countries you will use SMS to pay services and goods. So you need to write the message first and after that you need to write number wich you use maybe only once. You dont want to add your phone full of useless numbers and you dont want to chat with wending machine. SMS is SMS not f... chat.,1

com.moez.QKSMS,Sarah Simoneau,The other raters must not have Call Control integrated with this messaging app. It stinks. Call control will not block any Spam texts unless u download this app. This app fails to block 90% of the spam texts as promised. Uninstalled.,2

com.moez.QKSMS,Mello Jello,Thanks for the update! Editing group chats was added it's awesome. It takes forever to sync messages but I'm super happy. Although it doesn't have gif look up this is perfect great job y'all 💜 Edit: OK so re-downloaded after some time and the only thing I'm struggling with is how my gifs look. Otherwise it looks great!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Gail Mendelman,"UPDATE; Downloaded again to try. I even bought the pro. Now it's taking forever to sync, messages are not sending. Losing contacts. If this can't be fixed ASAP then return my money now please!! I have been loving this app but recently it's been freezing my phone and I have to reboot. Only happens when using this app. Also, just startedaccidently calling everyone from it, non stop. Cant figure it out. I don't want to uninstall but....",3
com.moez.QKSMS,MJ Poppe,"Edit: 11/21/2022... When will this app receive an update? It's bugging on selecting a contact to text, and also... I'm not always being notified of new messages. I run android 11, & I regularly clean cache & I don't have unusual settings like bigger or smaller attachment. The app worked fine in the past, but is developing new problems as time progresses... Likely is that there are new performance concerns that aren't being fixed with regular updates as the last was 2/7/2021",2

com.moez.QKSMS,CJ C,"This review is for my own memory when installing after phone upgrades. Prior issues with non-stock camera apps no longer apply as newer phone capabilities are incompatible with not-stock cameras. However, a new issue has arisen, where images are attached to the message but instantly fail to send no matter the size. Must be able to send messages with images that are not unreasonably compressed to a quality that makes text illegible or loses image details, but this won't send images at all.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Jannik,"Very good app, love the quick response window. Unfortunately recently it sometimes says ""QKSMS has crashed"" when app is in background. Also I'd prefer to see when a message of someone else was sent as time stamp, maybe as an option",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Since returning from the development limbo last year this app has been excellent. Only real feature I want to see is RCS but I believe that's down to google dragging their feet with the API,5

I donated/paid because of the ""upcoming changes"" like Auto Reply. Now dev hasnt replied.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Al X,"I like this app and used it without problems for years. I like the ability to write a text now and schedule it to be sent later, great cos I have ideas in the night. This feature cost a small amount to unlock but is worth it. Great app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love the app and have payed for the extras but..before the update you could change the app icon color .. now you can't..I would like that to change if its possible again..and make gradient colors for the chat bubbles would be awesome..thanks,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Jack 1059,I really like it and no annoying ads. Do have a minor issue where it will randomly not send texts. Just gets stuck in 'sending'. Oneplus3t. Update. All sorted out. Works great. Love the app. Highly recommended. Pixel3a,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So far I like it, but it appears to be nearly identical to every other app out there, other than the dark theme, which I always prefer.  One feature that would set this app apart from every other out there is the ability to DELETE CONVERSATION from the notifications. I have installed almost every texting app available, looking for this feature and it dumbfounds me that this is not available.  You can do it in several e-mail applications, but never a texting app. Why? It seems so logical to me. I'm hoping this is something that the authour will consider, because I doubt I'm the only person asking for it.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This has a lot of potential. There's a few shortcomings but overall it's very functional. *Mobile numbers only* is a great feature. Ergonomics are good but not perfect, themes are good, decent selection of settings including some that even the other flexible apps do not, no ads, no bloat. Floating compose box is great. Night mode and color options are good. I found it sometimes very slow to display avatars in long threads. Attachments limited to photos & contacts, no auto-delete. (3.6.4)",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app has always had terrible bugs. Now it doesn't even start, it just force closes as soon as I open it.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's a great app but would overall like it if you could have default apps set on it so you don't have to select the camera or gallery app over and over again just to send something to someone.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Mike, Moto e running Android 6 I had to install this so that another app which blocks nuisance phone calls & texts, could block the texts, the two apps work together. (Very well) This message app works and looks ok. I'm not experiencing any problems now that I'm using Ver. 3.5.4 Would love to see a swipe action setting like, move to inbox, because in certain lighting conditions, touching a conversation doesn't open it but archives it instead, it's not a big deal I just unarchive it and carry on. I choose not to set up MMS in this app, as I use WhatsApp for any such messages, because my network supplier seems to charge for MMS content.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Good but if I'm sent an audio message it does not show up so I have to go to my stock app.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Can feature be added so you can easily select a radial button next to texts when deleting texts?  Having to press and hold a text to select for deletion seems a bit klunky.,2

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Excellent app. Very easy to personalise with colour and tones for individuals.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Not bad but lacking a few things. The thing most important to me is, when 
you get a reply from a text you send, there's no time on that reply text. 
That needs fixing. I'll stay with this application for now,but if the time 
of all texts were there, I might stay permanently Thanks for your reply, 
I'm happy that I can tap to find the time. I've amended to 5 stars. Was 
harsh of me to give three stars earlier .",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The only thing that ruined this is when you tap a conversation, then went back to the cobversation list, at a split second it shows the home screen. It's like the conversation and the conversation list are two different apps. I'm looking forward for the devs to fix that issue.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is really cool! This is almost exactly what I was looking for 
since I just updated my phone and the text message bubbles turned an ugly 
yellow and grey. The only thing that dissapoints me is that the background 
cannot be customized, which was one of the only things I really liked about 
the default messaging app. I really wish there was an app like this where 
the background could be customized as well as the text message bubble 
colors, that's all I've been looking for during the past few hours. All I 
really wanted to do was change the color of the text bubbles, but no other 
app seems to let you do that. If this app ever allows a custom background, 
i would definitely switch over to this one!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I gave the same review in 2016. It doesn't do any good to be able to give a certain notification tone to specific contacts and this app if you delete the text message and it also delete the assigned message tone. So in 2 years this hasn't been fixed.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"1) Open source, donation water based (I paid the measly six dollars it costs, as it is a true GEM in the plethora of trash on the Google market), 'nough said. 2) No adds, no tracking, no data collection, no private or corporate interest, Simply PURE experience. With that said, ever since I had an Android based smartphone in my life, I always wanted to have a better alternative to the stock Android SMS app, or any other manufacturer supplied SMS app that would come with any phone I would have and this is IT. DON'T LOOK NO FURTHER, JUST GET IT!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great alternative to Android Messages! The one feature I think it could use is if contacts’ individual colors applied across conversations, making it easier to distinguish them in group convos.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Missing on basic feature, can't send contact via sms. Otherwise good app",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Would give it 5 stars if it had link previews. Really the only significant missing feature, just want to be able to see the you tube clip name without having to click it. Other than that it's great!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"hey, liked this app.. can you add hide messages feature or private message with pin security. would love that",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,A very very good start. - A think its also nice to have of there is an option to enable automatically or randomly theme a conversation and its profile head. Thanks QKSMS. I'll be using this for awhile now.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I am so glad this app works in conjunction with Should I Answer. It has been a lifesaver. Spoofing had taken over my phone and this app allowed me to keep my sanity when text messages started flowing in nonstop. Thank you.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I want to be able to select whether to send a group msg as SMS or MMS. This does not seem to have that option,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Best of bests.❤ You'll get everything you want for messaging in this app. Loved it. I would rate 10 out of 5😬,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Much better than the limited junk already installed. I have a need to block unknown and foreign numbers. This does that and so much more beautifully,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I loved it until I found out I can't send picture messages. :'( It keeps telling me sending failed. How can I get this fixed so I can use this app again? Moez- thanks for your reply. I tried this but it did not fix the problem. Any other ideas?,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the look of the app. Only problem is if I send a message to a new 
number and make a contact afterwards it doesn't add a name to the 
conversation. Please fix.",3

properly. It won't actually bring me to the message with the term I

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Efficient, lightweight, simple. Just what I want. No frills, stable, reliable . And I got immediate reply when asking for help",5

Should this be fixed, I'd happily change my rating.  UPDATE 8/9/18 After a reply from the developer with a remedy for my situation (see below), I am making this a 5-star review.  I appreciated the response, and am satisfied with this app.",5

option. 3. Dual sim support is added recently but the default sim changes 
automatically, if we recieve msgs from the other number.",4

messaging for me(after choosing a picture, it just shows a white preview

reference I'm using the Piktures gallery app, if that helps you figure out 
this bug. Dark mode is fantastic by the way. Hopefully you get the picture 
messaging bug figured out! It's not a huge loss that I can't wait to have 
fixed. One suggestion I have, is that you make it so that the app 
automatically scrolls to the bottom of the messages when opening the 
keyboard. At least with my phone, it seems to not do so and you have to 
close the keyboard in order to see them. If you weren't aware of this, 
well, you're welcome lol. It would be a significant QOL improvement. Thanks 
for the great free app! I wish you well in fixing these things soon.",5

only improvements I'd like to see are improved portrait mode support on the 
the premium version theme page and keyboard navigation and hotkey support

trivial and it's already vastly superior to the alternatives. Once again 
FOSS has proven to be the only way to go for quality software!",5

open source. I had three problems which prevented me from using it. 1. The 
app didn't warn me when sending a SMS failed. So I was unaware that the 
person I sent it to didn't get my message. This is unacceptable. 2. When 
sharing an item to send via SMS the app doesn't sort the contact list by 
most recent conversations. This means if you have to search for the contact 
each time instead of having your frequent and recent conversations pop up 
automatically. This slowls things down a lot. 3. You can't share/send 
multiple images or pictures to an SMS at once. Just one at a time. That's a 
slow way to send pix when combined with #2 above. If these changed I would 
switch back. For now it's back to Google messenger which has its own 
annoyances but at least sends SMS reliably and warns if it fails.",3

now i used 10 minutes to figure out how i can send a text message to a

Reddit. But now I'm done..",2

this open source one. The title is not a misnomer, the app is really quick, 
and quite smooth. It's a bit bare-bones feature wise, but does everything I 
need so far. I checked out the GitHub and the developer is very open to 
feature suggestions, I saw quite a few suggestions get discussed / 
backlogged. The dev himself also is continually thinking up features and 
finding & fixing problems. Awesome!",5

the developer is awesome as well. I submitted a bug report. I received an 
email from the dev within a few hours saying it had been fixed, and the 
update should be available the next day. For that kind of response, I'm

complaints...Multi-conversation select works now, but in true black theme 
there is no noticable color change when selecting messages. Time/date 
format is still not customizable and is in the wrong order. Overall, a 
great app and has replaced my default due to the recent feature additions.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great for use with ""Should I Answer"", but Blocked Numbers should be on the 
first screen, and not buried in Settings (esp. since it doesn't push 
notifications on blocked messages like SIA). It makes it difficult to use 
for visual impairments. App should also notify on blocked messages since I 
wouldn't know otherwise (as Bixby and Google assistant are setup to 
announce notifications). Fix these and you'll get 5☆ I've donated to this 
developer to support them and so should you 😀",3

Another issue is that you cant block that either (it dissapears, but on 
next app opening it shows up again).",5

this app. Thx",3

failing to send. One issue I do have is when sending picture mail it 
automatically turns the photo sideways - can we fix this? Also using 
SwiftKey Keyboard it messes up my punctuation when double tapping to insert 
the period. I have to go back and correct it, this only happens while in 
your app. I would love to give 5 stars because I paid $2.99 for the 
membership in order to be able to pick a color for the theme that wasn't a 
standard color. I would like to see better membership options. Regardless 
this is the best sms mms app out there and I plan on continuing to use it.

when I went to click on a previous convo the text was GONE! I can see my 
full list of previous contacts and a preview of the last text but as soon

Good job! One thing though, this update removed some personalisation

options). I know you worked hard on this new version, but it would be 
really cool if you could bring those features back. Keep up the good work !",5

the hamburger should animate into a back arrow so you don't have to click 
the canvas space to cancel the search. App shortcuts from the homescreen 
would be nice, and it would be cool if you could get the app icon to match 
the theme color selected in the app. I am not sure how this would work with 
adaptive icons, but Textra has somehow figured out a way to make the app 
icon customizable. Overall very good texting app.",4

number of seconds that it will give you before it sends where you can press 
cancel (I put a 1s delay for typos etc.). I think there was something else 
wrong too, but I can't remember right now. Maybe something else is wrong 
with the scrolling because it's acting up while writing this review (first 
review I wrote on this phone). Everything was fine until it updated, where

it used to for me.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like the fact it's open source & doesn't want permissions to everything but it doesn't synch to my Contacts properly. It won't send photos or attachments generally But worst of all it crashes all the time. Today it crashed 3 times.  WILL YOU PLEASE FIX WHATEVER IS CAUSING THE CRASHING. I know I'm not the only one experiencing this problem,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, but one hiccup. I can't seem to get rid of the unread messages badge. It keeps increasing its value, although I have read all my messages already. Any dev feedback would be greatly appreciated   My phone is an unlocked ASUS_Z00AD running on AT&T 4G LTE",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I've been on the look out for a good SMS app forever. I just need two features. 1. Ability to mark messages are read or delete them from the notification 2. Swipe to delete messages within the main UI If you can get these two features then I promise I'll never use any other SMS app ever again. That's a promise.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Does not include scheduling option,  delayed send only: so it's only bog standard amongst apps. Good customisation options - v similar to Textra; also integrates with 'should I answer' to sync blocking calls.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very nice app! Great looking, light and fast. The only thing that's keeping 
me from using it as my default SMS app is that no matter which of my two 
SIMs I use, it always reverts to the default one. If it used the SIM based 
on previous messages, it would get 5 stars and I'd never look for another 
SMS app",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is simple to use, extremely good looking (adhere to material design), especially appearance settings are so easy to use. Does lack some high level customisation offered in other apps but not to worry as not used often. Icon needs some work as it should depict something on sms. QK compose is a superb feature who do lots of sms. Blocking & blacklisting needs development as not much effective. Best part is it doesn't have any ADS",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app with alot of awesome customization! However notifications sometimes get stuck on one text and won't let you interact. This is kinda annoying. Also when hitting the home button it takes me to my launcher menu instead of my homepage. Great App tho and I still use it as my default app,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I don't normally write reviews but for this app, I made an exception. This app just works flawlessly. And the customizations options are pretty cool. For Example: if you don't like the white icon color, you can easily change it in the settings to another color. Kudos to the development team. Also, it's ad free!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Have been looking for a new long term messaging app after getting sick of GoSmS making a pigs ear of their once mighty application.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Though my settings are right,  and though my MMS are delivered withing my stock messagging app,. this app can't send the same MMS that my stock app does delivered. Without this issue I would give it 3 stars and be happy to pay for it. Other fault: There are not enough options for the start button colors to choose from,   no aligment to the right for RTL languages, missing dual sim support, no option for different coloring for each contact, no way to view the network settings instalation messages.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Here's the thing. This app looks beautiful. I really wanted to be able to use it. Sadly, it's got some issues with slowness. I use a OnePlus 3T and have no problems with other apps but this one is slow to open and laggy to send. I want to like it, and it seems the developers are invested in it, so hopefully I can come back to it in the future.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It works great most of the time and has features that I want in a SMS app but apparently there is a memory leak issue. Once or twice a day it has to be force stopped and restarted or the phone becomes sluggish. After restarting it the phone is fine for 12 to 20 hours.. installed on a Samsung S5. Fix that issue and I'd give it 5 plus stars.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app used to be fast when I first installed it last year. But now it is sluggish and I often have to wait for it to open my conversation from a notification. Temporal and ancestral navigation is still not fixed since my last feedback. Also can't attach pictures from camera, but it worked before.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It is simple,doesn't take up space and it makes my phone run a lot smoother. Whatever the heck was going on with my phone when I got a msg was not working. The notification would lock up sometimes. I was getting texts much later than they were actually sent. So far so good. Thank you!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've had this app a week and I was really enjoying it.  Untill I found out that my messages weren't going through. Then I started getting sending errors and even resend errors. Not sending the text is a deal breaker for me. YOU HAD 1 JOB, CARL!",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a very nicely designed app, but for whatever reason it just does not receive or send messages reliably. I do not understand why, as it is the only SMS app I have tried that is so inconsistent and its ability to send and receive. That is especially true of MMS messages. It is a real shame, because the design is the nicest I've seen of any SMS app out there, including the highly rated versions that cost several dollars. I would use this as my daily driver if it were reliable. Unfortunately, it just isn't.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Would give it more stars, but I do not like how there is no way to resize the modal pop-up window.  It appears the same size as the message which can cause the window size to vary.  If there was a way for me to set height & width of the modal pop up would easily get 5 stars.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just installed and tested: 1. I don't really want to give access to 
microphone and location ---- for an Sms app 2. How do I insert contact 
details into an sms - often required 3. How do I forward multiple 
conversations, or multiple Sms inside a conversation - often required 4. 
The change log shows September 2016 as the last date, is the app no longer 
being developed? Overall a nicely designed app, would be happy to donate if 
the above points could be addressed. Also",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just uninstalled it. It was delaying some texts to me by about 1 to 12 minutes, or just blocking them entirely (it took a long time to realize this).  Senders were told ""send failed"" by their SMS apps. When I tried to send texts, about 10-15% of the time QKSMS would say ""send failed."" But if I sent again, recipients would get both.  This was integrating with the Should I Answer? app. If you don't use that setting, maybe you won't have the same issues?  Now my SMS nightmares are over, I hope!",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really like it. Clean design, smooth and fast. But one issue I have is when someone text me with two different phone numbers, it won't just show me the contact names. It would just show one with the name and one with phone number. Weird. I don't see that in other apps. Pls fix it. Other than that it's pretty cool. Highly recommended.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My Pixel has been having texting issues where my messages would sometimes go through right away, but some would send way later.  Made texting a nightmare, this app fixed this issue for me 5 stars for me.  Seems to be eating up a lot of battery though I'm trying to figure out why, any help on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,..its an awesome messaging app I really like how far this app has come it's awesome and you can now change the text tone and color for each conversation which is awesome only thing left to do is but at least for an sent sound option. I mean even some the other crappier SMS apps have a sent sound so I mean might not be important to some ppl but it should an option. Please! I know it's not a big deal to most people but some people like having a sent sound and go back to the old qksms icon,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love this app in every single way except one thing.  When I tap one the app it does not always open with the first tap.  When it does work it takes 1-2 seconds before it opens.  It makes my phone feel slow even though all my other apps launch instantly.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Open source, smooth, attractive, and checks all boxes: night theme, color options, option to hide avatars in the conversation list, landscape mode, wide bubbles for max information density, etc. Problems: time stamps pop in slowly in group messages. All group messages display ""NoSubject"" instead of the start of the most recent message in the conversations list. Tapping a notification doesn't take me to the correct conversation. The back button to return to menu bugs sometimes.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Add a way to schedule messages and it's perfect! I love the home screen and everything about it. The customization options for each contact, with changing the color of individual conversation, and option to change text and call sounds right from the conversation window. You guys are the bomb!

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Would be great if it wasn't so buggy. Immediately found: Every time pressing back (with hardware button or in-app) the Android running apps list is shown for half a second. Crashed when I said OK to setup MMS dialog. No scrollbars except in settings. Settings randomly changes the state of other toggles when you change one (although exiting and entering settings fixes this - is not actually changing other settings, jusr very confusing). Briefly turned on data even though I had WiFi on. I'm on Android 4.4.2.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really like this text app. And there are no ads. But I 've come across two problems:  1. My new messages don't stay up top. So if I dont immediately check them I have to scroll thru all of my texts to find the new message.  2. I have a lot of messages that wont send. I remember some here and there not going through before this app but now it is common for 2 out of 5 messages to not go through.  I want to keep the app. Is there a fix or work around for this? I'd be happy to leave 5 stars if these were resolved.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I got this because Hangouts won't support SMS messages anymore. And it looks the same, except better: it even has a night mode. One problem : when receiving messages, pop up windows open instead of banners up top, and the app has no settings to fix that mechanic. Moez, please add a setting change for that so I can just see banners instead.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app offers your choice of background colors, delivery  confirmation, access to send from notification bar, works with ""Should I Answer?"" and is ad free.

I have sent QK messages to clear this up. But ironically, they do not receive my messages!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I loved this app as a replacement to my stock LG G5 texting app. However, there does not seem to be an option to disable the notification pop-ups. This is my first non-Samsung phone since the S1, so adjusting to a new phone has proven to be very difficult. All I need is an all-black theme and background in order to save battery power (which this app does have), and non-intrusive notifications without pop-ups in my face, the latter of which has failed miserably. Add this option, and I will be one HAPPY user!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a very useful application with only a couple of problems. First off, it needs to give the option to click on a contact name when starting a new message conversation. It is very annoying to have to manually enter a phone number that already exists in your contact list. Secondly, it needs to give the option to attach files not just access the gallery. I prefer personally to attach photos directly from my file manager and it will not allow for this. Other than that it is a very useful application. I love the dark and app and black themes period I am legally blind so having a dark theme is a must. It really helps being able to see it and the adjustable fonts are helpful as well.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great look and features, and it's fast and responsive. A bit buggy though - as someone mentioned below, the app breaks the home button... it sends me to add/remove pages rather than to my desktop.  Android 7.0",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,So far I think that it is a great app #1 Except that I have gotten a few messages from the app saying download failed. #2 I wish I was able to remove pictures that was sent in a text without deleting the whole text.

For Example: If it says you have 15 messages in the conversation you are looking at, but it will only let you go back through ""4 or 5"" of those messages Only.      This is a Big Flaw within this application. Also a lot of the time the UI is extremely slow to respond. I'll give it a few more days to see if the issue's are correctly addressed and fixed. If not then I'll be forced to UNINSTALL This application. Look at the ""bad reviews by the User's.""     If you read them developer you'll then be able to see the issue's within your messageing app. that 6ou missed and the user's have found and fix them. I look forward to an Update with great fixes for the many bugs still in this application. Thanks in advance for fixing this app to work 100% correctly. ☺️",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Coming from iOS, the only thing I miss is Apple's obsessive attention to detail. So QKSMS is a treasure to me! Fantastic functionality (popup replies, text delay, customisability, proximity sensor, etc) AND design. Things like having the choice to hide contacts' phone numbers on the messaging screen are a really nice touch. Devs: would like to see a grey icon option and some slick animations in Conversations page, but that's honestly all I can think of. Will donate on payday!",5

is not being able to see what I type in quick reply when using night mode. 
I'm still giving it 5 stars, but I sincerely hope it gets fixed. Everything 
else is radical. It's not the original intent of this app, but: I would 
love the option for secure encrypted chat! I currently use Signal for that. 
And, inevitably, I end up using it as my only and default messaging app for 
convenience. If QKSMS had some privacy and security features I would 
certainly switch back. But, for now it's just more convenient to use one 
app for both secure and standard messaging.",5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice clean look. Not as much customization as others but that's fine...I do appreciate not being overwhelmed with endless options. I just wished one of the features I really use (delayed timer on messages sent) worked properly. From what I understand it has to be enabled before EVERY sent message...and even at that it still doesn't delay anything (even if I set the delay at 30 sec in the settings). It is a totally free/ad free app though...so I will stop complaining... Thks devs!!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like the app quite a bit unfortunately I need to block a certain number that I get notifications for all through the day.

Unfortunately, my experience has failed to live up to my hopes, not because of its design, but because of its performance.  QKSMS's interface seems to be very laggy and unstable. It will frequently hang for several seconds, or become confused and take me where I wasn't expecting to go. I often have to set my phone down for a few seconds to let the app sort itself out, before I try and navigate back to where I actually wanted to be. It will occasionally close the keyboard without obvious cause, or boot me back to the conversation list while typing a message.  Additionally, it doesn't seem to have good MMS support; all of my MMS messages have timestamps from 1970 in the conversation view and all appear at the bottom - despite the fact that long-pressing an MMS message gives a perfectly fine timestamp.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Group messaging does not work. Send function is very slow. App glitches fairly often. Interface is sleek and easy to use. I wish that these bugs would be fixed.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have tried several SMS app and this is the best in terms of its usability, aesthetics, ad free platform and very minimalist. User friendly SMS app in playstore. Thank you Dev for this amazing app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I can't click on a picture to view it larger. It opens the gallery with a black screen because it's not downloaded. I just want to view and can't!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"However, it is kinda time consuming when you click the back button and the homescreen would somehow display. I thought the app crashed. And also, in the conversation, the messages take up the whole screen, is that really necessary? Well, anyways. The app is absolutely almost perfect for text messaging. Good job!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app has some nice features. The ability to change the color theme is nice. But one feature that is missing that I use often is to send an SMS to an email address. I often send a quick reminder as an SMS. When I tried to send such a message it failed.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I missed multiple important work related messages because of this app. It wasn't blocking the numbers, just not getting messages until after a restart. Not cool!",2

I'm receiving text from today but anyone who reply to my text messages it says December 31st 1969  6pm why would it say that when it's November 29,2016?  Please fix this problem immediately please?  Only a few texts have the right date time from the recipients Why is that most of my recipients texts say Dec 31st 1969 6pm?     please update and fix this problem pretty please?  I just downloaded it tonight.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Slow and laggy, almost unusable.. Needs some major bug fixes.  Like the features and look though. However not worth using as default app with all the lag",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app for blocking annoying texts from people or businesses. However you can't send or receive photos. At all. So if that is important to you find another app.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Functions ok but deployment time is way too slow. It should open up instantly but it doesn't.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Simple and functional. This messaging app exceeds my expectations. Besides the customizable look, I've had no problems with sending or receiving a message either. Would definitely recommend.",5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love the app but it stutters randomly and when going thru sms threads all the MMS pics are just 1 photo... never seen this problem in another sms app and I'm guessing it won't get fixed cause this app hasn't been updated in a year which is a shame,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"hi,  please add contact name search facility.  like i want to search conversation done with my friend so when i type his name the  conversation should appear.   search may be done through content and contact name at once will be better.  Thanks",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Dont like the fact it needs to be part of call blocking feature of another app. And highly unlikely it was tested with Android 7 da it is out,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Works alright, but has a number of bugs that just don't seem to get fixed. Notifications don't appear, adding contacts doesn't work, super slow, at times.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I configured Quick Reply, but it opens the app while I'm doing other things outside it. Of course, that's the QR function, but it literally opens the full conversation, with the app in the first plan",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the design and feature set, but,  in Sprint a d Verizon accounts I have an awful time sending photos.  They fail 80% of the time.  Fix that and it is 5 stars all the way",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Tapping into a notification or responding from the notification dialog sometimes takes you/sends to the wrong message thread. Just exposed family health concerns to a new acquaintance.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Not to bad. Suprised app comes highly suggested but hasn't been updated since 2016,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Simply works. MMS and SMS notifications work flawlessly. Dev responds very quickly. 10 stars. Thanks for keeping it simple and clean.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,very nice app. customizing is easy. maybe remove 'donate' toggle once donation has been sent  ;),4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Sending pictures is quite limited. Other intents allow me to send pics from Dropbox, and default Messaging app lets me attach maps, videos, voice recordings, contacts, etc. I lose all of that functionality. Plus, how do I attach something after I've already started typing?",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I have to send MMS messages SEVERAL times. Group messages sometimes do not come through. I have to uninstall this app in order for things to sync and work. I do enjoy the premise of this app. I'll go back to Textra however if the issue is not fixed.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I would like to have a messaging app where the group text just used individual contact text tones, not it's own tone. I want to know what person is messaging me, and not every group that I'm in have its own tone.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Not happy with it I'm sure ""should I Answer?"" A++app, said I'd need this to 
stop spam. It does not stop anything. As it's just another app I'm taking 
it out and using the stock as that is perfectly fine apart from the bad 
actors,as its pointless having 2.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App seems to do exactly what it's supposed to but only some friends get MMS with this app. Most do not. Using Verizon and tried the app on 2 different brand of phones both failed MMS with verizon,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Was my favorite texting app until I found out there isn't an option to add a new contact from a message of a new number. How do you miss that? That's critical. Or am I missing a hidden gem of a feature? If it's there, it shouldn't be so hard to find.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Awesome app. Easy to text and love the appearance and themes. Clearly the beat texting app. I would however greatly appreciate if you would add support for dual sim phones so that we can be able to tell which text is from which line. Thank you,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Hope you could add this where in we could send contacts thru sms. It would be a great help.  More improvements. Still love this app,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Simple clean style, but no annoying pointless additions like mood messengers insane emoticons and textras annoying adverts. Maybe some more style customisations would be good, but it's a nice app",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Almost perfect! It should have an archive option with a swipe left/right capability. Other than that its great. Do that and the app deserves 4 to 5 stars,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really clean and nice but still needs to be optimized better. Uses a lot of ram and there's some graphical lag like when you go from your own colour theme in your convo to the default in the messages board,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Not able to send MMS. Otherwise fine. You'll be unable to send or receive group text or attachments. Please fix the mms issue. Tried with stock and other messaging app and those worked without any issues when sending mms.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Loving this app. Just one thing. Sometimes when I go back into the app it gets stuck and crashes. Other than that it's a great texting app and it's really quick. Thanks,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love it. It runs better than the original that came with my phone. What is truly awesome is that you get pop-up onscreen notifications so u don't have to go into the app to send messages. Amazing...,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I'd have given the app 5 stars of it wasn't for how small the reply window is. Make this bigger please to use more of the screen space available.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like the app so far.  It looks a lot like Google's messaging app which is my favorite app but I'm having issues with it so I wanted to try something else.  I'm not having the same issues with this app so far but one strange issue is that it doesn't display one of my contacts name only their phone number.  Is there any way to fix that?,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I absolutely love my Should I Answer app for blocking unwanted calls. This app was recommended to work with that app to block unwanted texts (yes, I'm getting sales/scam texts). Already love the UI and host of options!",5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a lovely app with the best settings. One improvement would be more of an animation when sending the message (similar to that of imessage), custom LED notification colours for each contact, outgoing sounds, and more message bubble styles.

Lots of features can be configured, such as turning off the avatars in the conversation window so you have more room for the actual messages.  The code is open source which is very cool.  There are no ads.  It is free with a donate button in the app, I certainly sent the developer a donation.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love it so much. It's easy to use and it looks nice. It looks amazing and the ability to customize everything is so useful.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Quite poor really. Shows only conversations. Cannot work out how to send a text to someone else in my contacts.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love this app! The only complaint I have with it is that it opens kinda slow and lags when I tap a conversation but that might also be because of the  Swift keyboard,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The block feature is broken. When you block people and restart the application they are no longer hidden.,4

I have to turn off my WiFi to send and receive a picture and I have to break up my long text messages to send them. Also if I start typing and have to come back to the message, what I've typed isn't always there and I have to start over. Really love the app and would hate to have to stop using it",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I have been a Textra user for quite some time now and was looking to switch things up a bit.  The app is very solid. The only thing I really like more about Textra is the ability to personalize bubble colors for a specific contact.  This is especially helpful during group texting.  Just something to think about.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So far great app. Fast, light, just what you need. My first time giving a 5 star to an sms app. I might add to have a new option when creating a new message to show recent contacts in the call logs. Also, I suggest putting the timestamp in the middle rather than at the side because it cuts the conversation and it makes the conversation look cluttered. Putting it at the side confuses me also. Would also like to be able to swap between messages while inside the conversation. Pls reply devs",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is an amazing app. Really customizable, and the simple design is easy to use. Also, it's open source! The only thing I'd like to see is different emoji packs. As most of my friends have iPhones (and the Samsung emojis look weird imo), I usually set my emojis to either Emoji One or iOS. I'd really like to see this feature added.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's coooll BUT I have and issue about the the length and width of the message bubble. There should be a setting in the appearance which allows the user to configure the desired length and width of the bubble because the present size of the bubble is way too big and it's not nice at all. Will give you 5 🌟s if you add that feature in the next update! 😋 ;),3

I occasionally don't get notifications when I receive a SMS or MMS. No LED blinking, nothing in my notification bar, no sounds or vibrate. I only realize I have a missed message by opening the app. Nova launcher with the tesla-unread plug-in doesn't even catch that I have a new message either. Verizon Samsung Galaxy s4",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,How can u change between the two sims in dual sim phones.. I stead of even asking it sents from the default sim.. its reallt annoying beacause i have to change the default settings each and every time.. please fix this.. add a feature to select or toggle between two sims.. (Like in Google Messenger or in every built in app) Overall its a great package.. Good Work mate.. I'll rate 5 stars after Adding that feature.. Cheers..,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like it. So light in size and clean. But can you fix the laggy QKREPLY portion? Such that it responds too late. Maybe, 8secs delayed after I had done my message? and also with the opening of the app. It also takes a moment for so long to launch. Well,,  such a great app!! Very handy and useful shortcuts!! Iloveit! Ill give you 5stars if you can fix those! Thankyou QKSMS! 😊😊😊",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Crashes often and the contact pictures doesn't load quickly. The ui is nice and its kinda responsive,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Wonderful. Please give dual sim support. At least I should know which of the sims received the message.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The best messenger out one small update would be cool to make the emoji's larger or add animation to them that would be cool! Over this is really nice.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,A perfect alternative of stock messaging app. Try a lot of app but finally I got this. Epic app.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Just came across the app and truly love the features but I am on T-Mobile and it seems to not work with wifi calling or mms over wifi. Any fix upcoming?,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Format's fine but there's no enabling of dual sim messaging. Hope you add that feature for dual phones. Thanks!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I would like to send files via mms instead of only pics and vid... can this happen??.. then the app would be 100% perfect.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really like this app and its capabilities and I am happy to know that you will be bringing back the app icon colors in the next update. Thank you for bringing back app icon colors!!!!!!!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Better than Textra. But further development is discontinued, i guess.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But give options like SELECT ALL to delete all SMSes and SCHEDULE SENDING to send SMSes on specific time we want,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Could use sound for sending messages or on delivery.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is PERFECT,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Good,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Loved it,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really want to love this app. It has everything I want. So many good settings and configuration options. The only disappointment is the icon. When I look at it, I don't think about messaging at all. As boring as it sounds, I much prefer a generic message bubble. Thinking about going back to the stock app for this one reason.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Excellent application.  There are occasional visual bugs that don't detract from functionality and disappear when closed and re-opened (for example: name of incoming message reflects most recent conversation instead of sender, empty toast displays; or, contact list shows numbers instead of names).  However, this is rare, and the app is in general very cleanly made and easy to use and configure.  The new icon (white donut-shaped Q) is ugly, and I preferred the previous one.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"doesn't interact well with twilight or eas or Spotify or even the system app. whenever I try to switch to qksms with these running, which either one or all always are, it tends to crash. it's my favorite UI though, so I'll see how long i can hang in there",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It started crashing a lot since the last update. The crashes usually occur when sending a message with the delaying option set on.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the app but if I look back on previous txts the time stamp is wrong by 46 years, apparently all my txts were sent to me on 1 June 1970 lol. Fix this and I might start using the app again.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the configurable nature and open source, has been crashing on me a lot recently, will look into it later",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great material design and look but with some ocassional irritating problems like not getting notifications all the time and app crashing. It is also annoying that not all messages have a time stamp and that you have to scroll the editing window to see the entire message you are writing. Going with textra again...,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I actually like the new icon, but I do wish the notification icon itself matched the app icon shape, like other SMS apps (Google Messenger, Hangouts, Textra, etc.). If that was changed or at least given options, this would get 5 stars no questions asked. Well done otherwise!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Your app is great and very useful but after update app I can't send SMS when I disable one of my sim cards. I don't know why your app try to send SMS just from sim 2. I just use sim 1 for call and SMS and sim 2 just for data. Please fix it. Thanks so much,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My friends are telling me that longer texts are being broken up into separate messages. I tried using the toggle to enable longer messages to turn into MMS to avoid this but it's still separating them. Any suggestions?  All is good otherwise!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Like the title says, this app is great. The pop-up windows and great interface make it stand out, and they finally fixed the logo.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I see ""QKSMS stopped working"" more often than I receive texts. 10/10 would download again.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When I found it, started wondering where was it hidden till date? I love this app. Does SMS right. No advert, no nonsense. Has every feature I could ask for. Has night mode, flexibility to choose theme colour, font, add a delay which is a life saver! Strongly recommended. 👍",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When trying to attach an image or take a photo to send through compose, it does not work. I have to go to an already given conversation just to send a photo. I Can't begin a new one and send a photo first hand. Also when going into conversations the most recent picture is a picture from another conversation, but it's shown as all conversations when looking at the most recent photo.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,No pesky adds. No extra junk you don't need. Clean interface with just the right amount of customization. Absolutely perfect. Wouldn't change a thing.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Clean interface,  highly customizable, useful features, light on my phones memory. So glad I didn't pay for a different sms app before I found this one.  Will be donating soon.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Still has intermittent bugs; sometimes texts aren't received or can't be found.  Some texts don't show up in the preview window.   Delivery fail reports don't show quickly.  Would love to use as my daily driver but just not ready yet.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is good. My only concern is that, the qk reply popup is kinda buggy, whenever I use it, instead of opening the reply popup, it opens the whole app. I hope this gets fixed soon.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really liked the app until I realized there is no ability to send an audio message.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Last night version 2.7 downloaded on my Verizon Droid Turbo.  The Icon changed but so did the ability to change the icon color.  Now it's just white or black.  No setting to update icon color.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Jag kan inte gå in i konversationerna som jag skickat mms i. Hela appen kraschar.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I do love the ability to block texts.  But swipe is horrible detection and the keyboard covers up my current outgoing message, so I can't see it.  Help",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's one of the few sms apps that allow you to mark a message ad read from the notification bar, and that is great! It is however force closing from time to time on my device.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really enjoy this app but it freezes and force closes a lot. Disappointing.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Since there doesn't seem to be a way to message the provider I must say that since the update the function for a small chat window pop up no longer works which was an important function for me. Who approved this?,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I would have loved to give you all stars- you are good -really worth having on the device BUT -where is the dual sim support or the option to choose the preferred sim to send the text through . If so then  I would love to send the first message to you only.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Light and fast open source sms app, does what it says without too much extra cruft. The icon is unfortunately both hideous and hard to see, given it's only in black and white. Recommend pickable colours at the very least.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Sad, I love everything about this app but no MMS messages will go through",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"...It has crashed four times today, and it completely lost me when I couldn't attach more than one picture at a time. Definitely did not make me love texting again.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Running wise, I don't notice anything different. Running on Marshmellow - Note 4.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I would really like this app if it didn't crash so much.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Can't send MMS though, fix that and it will be perfect",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I cant see whats in the ""appearance -&gt; message bubbles"" because clicking that causes fc. Also fc when clicked ""conversation settings"". Android 4.2 here. Also, agree with others, the app icon is soo ugly. And please rid of Donate menu in every conversation window, its displeasing. Let it sit in the settings and/or about, like other normal apps, its overkill. Please fix these for more stars, thx.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App worked wonderfully until a week ago then it went down hill!!!,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This is an amazing sms app. You will fall in love with it !,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Simple and easy to use please on the next update make a customized message bubble. 😊,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,New icon is awful. Please add possibility to use old icon.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really like this app. Do you have any plans adding a dual sim function? I hope you you will and hope we have it the soonest!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Sometimes when i send the message, the message bubble of the sender side (right side) shows strangely collapsed which hides the message and won't get okay after restarting app. And sometimes it collapses the bubble but does not hide the message but makes it one letter per line like ""hello"" becomes h  e  l and so on. I can send you the screenshot if u need. P.s: The receiver gets the message right.",2

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like it,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really love the app but it has a flaw, for my personal use, that makes it a bit useless. I have a dual SIM phone and the app doesn't allow me to choose whether I want to text from one SIM or the other.  I normally text through my work SIM a lot but the app always sent them via my personal one.  Please fix this and I will come back to have as my default one.  Cheers",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So I like the app, just have three main problems. One I wish it would use my edge features when I get texts. Two I can't send or receive pictures. And third I don't care for the pop up that shows up, even when I am in the conversation. I know I can block all information. I just wanted to not have it. Especially if I'm in the conversation already. I'll give it a few days and see if I can hang, if not I'll be looking for something else. Other then those, it runs so smoothly and I love how quick it is.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Well done and thanks for the latest improvements to the app. Thank you for being responsive to glitches and new ideas. The shear amount of brilliant qualities this app has more than out way any problems. Keep up the great work and thanks again.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the app, but have noticed quite a few bugs, for example, when I switch pages, the app seems to disappear for few seconds, and scrolling through conversations seems to be a bit laggy, but that's probably my phone, so dont sweat if you can't make it smoother 😉. Overall, the best text messaging app!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, but has started to slow down...  Don't know if it's the latest build, but the app has gotten to the point where I'll press a button and wait 3 or 4 seconds for the app to respond. Buttons also in notification shade are not always working either, sometimes have to press 'reply' several times before it responds.  Just wanted to let you know, other than that, still love the app!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Would be nice to add voice messages. I've been having issues when quick replying on Android N like when I have two messages in my notifications and I use the quick reply to the person I wanna send the message to it instead sends to the other person in my notification.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the simple clean design, especially the subtle yet elegant animation when attaching photos. I was wondering if I can request to have more of those small animations elsewhere, and/or to add the animated Android emojis? Great SMS app regardless",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Facing issue with search option. Once enter some characters and then delete those characters... observed that app got hanged. Cannot go back, neeed to forcibly close the app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Like this app a lot but I'm not getting notifications for MMS messages... I've checked all the settings and it's set correctly. I'd like to continue to use the app but the MMS issue is a huge problem. Please help!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I wish that you will improve the sms setting wherein I can Send a group message. I have a hard time in this matter because I will go back to my default messaging. Thank you :),4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Was good until new release... Now strange things are happening deleted and going back to standard messing app,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Textra's ads just started flooding my sms inbox so time to switch. QKSMS nails the important features without bling or ads. Nice!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But I can't receive any pictures whats the point of being able to choose colors if you won't get your message,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like it. it's simple and easy. couple things it's missing for my preference. I'd love to have more font options and be able to change the style of the emoji,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I just installed this, so I'll revise my comments after putting some miles on. Only thing I can't find so far is signatures. I use texts in business, so this is a necessity for me. I hope I just overlooked it. Thank you.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Like it a lot, but with the recent update the integration with ""Should I Answer"" app seems to have stopped working.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really appreciate that this app has more features than my default texting app and that they have constant updates to keep it running smoothly.  One thing is that it occasionally crashes on me but other than that its perfect.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"God only knows how many more, textra is good but didn't like bubble colors, problem with chomp mms, yaata couldn't answer on watch to messages(only predefined). THIS his has it all 👍👍👍👍by far the best, any chance of font color, i like Grey, thanks",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I wanted to send text messages without many frills--just the options to choose basic color themes and to decide the formatting of my messages. QKSMS fits the bill.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So clean and smooth to use, feels and works as if it were a stock app! I love this so much. I've moved here from Textra and Messages+ and I consider QKsms to be better than those two.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,it's a must have app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the fact that this has Samsung multi window support. Very clean UI. Only wish it has media button in each conversation to view images that were sent and received.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's a really nice texting app. Great design, easy to use, however there are some bugs. The main one is that about one out of every 4 times opening the app, it blacks out, meaning there's nothing on the screen and you have to back out or clear your open apps. Another thing is that sometimes when you try to call someone from the contact option, it calls someone else (I believe it's the last persons conversation you were in).",3

My one issue was that in big group chats, the avatars wouldn't show up each time people switch talking, which could make the conversation hard to follow. However, the dev listened and fixed this. Now this is the perfect messaging app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Only had this app for a little while but what I've experienced is pretty great. There's only one problem that I had which was no scroll bar. I have a lot of texts and I don't want to manually scroll to find something g k sent a month or so ago,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The app is quick and lightweight for sure and has a good set of features as well. Supposedly open source as well!! All great...  However on using it the app is a little glitchy. The settings toggles seem to not work correctly. Sometimes when off they are lit up and vice versa. The slide to view previous conversation is weird and doesn't work on my phone. It also showed the settings as a previous conversation. LOL. Tried on lollipop xperia z1,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've tried to use this app to replace my default text app many times in the past. It's a simple yet beautiful app that's also pretty snappy. I'm giving it 4 stars though because notifications are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes they work perfect, sometimes the sound works but there's no notification, and sometimes nothing comes up at all. I think if this is fixed, it will definitely be the best sms app out there! EDIT: This is more of a suggestion, but the proximity sensor feature is way too sensitive.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have tried each of the most popular sms apps (Chomp, textra, go sms, handcent etc) and this one is the best. Chomp was also nice but had issues with mms. QKSMS is beautiful, customizable and works well for now. The only 2 things that could be better are: Possibility to chose square contact thumbnails instead of circle, and a bit faster app opening.

However, there are two important functions that I still yet to get from this app. Firstly, Android phones commonly have dual sim cards and this app doesn't have the option for users to choose from which sim card they're sending the message from. Second, it doesn't have the option to directly save a contact from within the app. Also, a bug is literally annoying me.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Opening a conversation is not smooth. Allow color options for bubble background. Also vibration customization options would be nice. I found a bug where received pictures looks wrong but when you click on it it is the right image.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,One missing star is for laggy transitions to conversations. The other one is for lack of more traditional app icon,3

BEWARE PEOPLE AND STICK TO DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR REGION IN CASE ABUSE SO REPORT GETS RESPONSE.  THIS APP IS GREAT AND NEEDS A DONATE METHOD. I'll pay a lot to open source developers. Google+ me for info or any open source developers. Lets start a movement for a better internet.  I'm so serious ill put lots of money where my mouth ism,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the decency and elegance of the look of this messaging app. I just hope that for the nxt update you'll add some smooth transitions/animations like when opening a conversation and sending a message.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Just 2 stars because it has no emoji application that is needed to install just like what other sms app have. I don't like the built-in emoji on my phone. Please help me with these. Thankyou :),2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really love this app and want to give it 5 stars. However, one important thing is missing: an option that lets you add the number to your contacts directly from the app. I tend to mix up numbers a lot, so having this option to add to contacts would be great!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Has a major bug on my HTC One M8 GPE. If I change phone orientation while composing.. the text disappears and message comes up saying 'saved as draft' but is nowhere to be found, not fixed in 2 updates.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Loved it so much. All issues were fixed with th update. No complains so far. Keep up the good job 👍,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Started off promising but has started bugging out. When I open the app it opens blank and takes ages to find itself and has now lost ability to block messages from people and companies that harass! Main reason for downloading. Not only that the ones it blocked and hid historically have reappeared!,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"After such a promising start, this is just another complete letdown of an SMS app. So, so many issues/bugs in the last couple of updates, it's as if the devs are actually trying to break an app that was already working fine. Very frustrating after paying for the 'Pro' (or whatever) version in the early days of the app's development. Poor show from devs, I'm afraid. Just not acceptable. Avoid.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I just downloaded this app, and I can already tell that it's superior to others on the app store. Interface is smooth, there's LOADS of customization compared to Google's ""Messenger"" or hangouts, and you can even change the icon to match your theme color from the app! I can also send and receive MMS with Wi-Fi enabled, as opposed to having trouble with some other apps. Altogether, if you've had some trouble with SMS apps in the past and you're looking to call one ""home"", this is it! Keep up the great work!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"would love to keep using this as it is absolutely the best one there is but it is just too unstable on my phone. freezes as soon as it loads, most of the time it crashes. trouble sending and receiving messages. had to find another SMS app. PLEASE FIX!

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I didn't think I'd ever say it, but it has happened: I finally found an app I am willing to replace my stock messaging application with. QKSMS has far exceeded my expectations. So many great features.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Wow, this app is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, the UI is 10000 times better than Textra's... But where are my Gifs? I need the ability to send Gifs and vCards... Those are really important to me! Please add the option to send Gifs as MMS (not as links, and grab them directly from the app just like in Textra) and I will 100% switch from Textra to you... I love your UI so much more than Textra's, but I'll stick with them for now cause they have way more options! Please add Gifs!",1

I deleted the beta because I couldn't use it like that and now you launch this update with the same issues(app doesn't launch) LE: Sometimes the app doesn't open, so I have to close it from memory and try again.",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is amazing! It's so fast, much faster than the stock app! Great interface and customisation options. Really very impressed. The only issue is MMS images display really small when they're pressed on. Doesn't match the rest of the UI.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My only complaint is that when my phone restarts, which happens often, the app has to be re-added to my home screen. If this gets fixed, the app will definitely be 5 stars!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,You can reply out of the app with a pop up and its not broken like hangouts is,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"There isn't a perfect texting app for me-but hopefully if you guys consider my suggestions, there can be! I would like there to be a scheduled text option, so I can write a text and have it be sent at a predetermined day/time.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is visually similar to Textra (which I used for years, uninstalled after they loaded it with ads and make you re-pay for ad free every few updates).

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the way it looks and moves and feels but its lacking a few things. I want a better quick reply. AWsms has the best quick reply I've ever used on a texting app. I would like to see that added in. Also I would like more custom options, like changing message bubble colors. Other than that its a great app. So all in all I just really want a better quick reply added to it! Thanks again!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is fast and smooth, and has a proper quick reply that actually shows what you're replying to (looking at you, Google Messenger.) The only feature I would love to have is the quick reply window on the lock screen, like Textra has. Other than that, this is now my preferred messaging app. Thanks for all the work!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very small footprint. Fast and responsive with adequate customizability. Retains most of UI in Messenger. Mark As Read from notification could be the sole reason for replacing the stock app for this app. Miss the random colours on the chat list, though. The only issue I found was that it did not find messages containing search words, while stock Messenger did. Keep it snappy and error-free but do not weigh down with too many extra features.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"After divorcing 2 awful SMS apps I found this. I love the fluidity and simplicity this app has. My only quarrels that made me dock 2 stars are that 1. I can't customize my vibration sound, I got used to not having it in my last app but would love it here and 2. We'll this isn't really a problem but in previous apps there was a button to send a sample message to yourself to see things like notification changes, led blinker or your vibration settings if you had them. These things would have me hooked for life",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have an issue with multiple messages being sent when using my hardware keyboard on the Blackberry Priv.  I have enter set to send message. But it always sends two messages.  My original message. And then a second blank one that says sending and never completes.  I have to manually delete each one.  Other than that an option to add a notification on sent messages would be great .  Other than that,  it's a great app.  Keep up the good work!!   I just noticed it doesn't happen in pop-up reply window",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love this app. This has been the stock sms app replacement I've been looking for! I just have a small problem: whenever I compose a new message and send it, it doesn't seem to appear on the screen instantly. I have to exit the app first to see the text message I've sent. Hoping this could be fixed in an update.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I tried this out of curiosity because I'd been using Textra for months and didn't think anything could beat it. I was wrong! Qksms has a similar feature set but is much quicker to use. And it's (now) free! Seems to hang every other day, though!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When in typing new msgs to someone, it'd be nice if the dang notifications wouldn't interrupt, causing the keyboard and app to get interrupted. It's quite a nuisance.

I have multiple numbers for people, but I don't want to delete them because I want to keep them in the thread. And I can't change the message font size. I can change the settings font size, but not when I'm in a message thread. Otherwise, this app is really great!!",5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Completely flawless sms + MMS replacement,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I just started using this app and I already love it! One main reason is that the mms works much better than any app iv used! The only thing I would complain about is the animations because they are a bit laggy,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's great that you can change the color based on contact but you should make it automatic baced on the contact picture. Also it would be great if the quick reply box would open if I click a button in a notification rather then just popping up over what I'm doing,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I am still comparing to the stock messenger and later some competition. But so far from what I see it looks good. Love the customizations of backgrounds. Would like to see you add a privacy policy tho so I know exactly what's going on before I delete the app for Textra.. This app also seems to sync good with the Hub on my BlackBerry, behaves similar to stock google in that it launches the app to view message out side the hub...",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Clean design, many nice features and very user friendly, but many bugs. Not smooth. It still lags (albeit less) and freezes with a white screen. The pop-up window lags too, not showing the body of the message for 2 seconds or so. It tends to pop up even when I'm within the app! Drafts are not visible! I have to open my stock app to see them. Deleted messages are not being deleted (I still see them in the stock app). Also, the new message indicator on the qksms icon shows I've got a new txt when I have none.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The main bugs for me are, when the screen orientation changes when half way through writing a message, it clears what I have written and I have to start again, it doesn't seem to save drafts at all so if I start typing and have to refer to another app like Gmail for example, when I return back to qksms to finish the message it has cleared it again. Also the sender name seems intermittent in the inbox, most times its fine but sometimes it just displays the number and I can't get it to show the name.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I want to like the app, for a while I had primarily used this as my SMS application, however I have too many issues with MMS(picture and group messaging). Pictures will randomly not show up that have already been sent or received, scrolling up and down may make them show up again.  The biggest issue is with group messaging. The app does not always show which person sent the message and you have to check details of individual message to see the number. Had these issues on 2 different phones.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've struggled to find a sms app that fulfils all of my requirements: material design, mms support, read recipts, and integration with contacts; QKSMS does it all. With its countless colour palates, it's simple, custom mms settings, and easy to use menu system (which in my opinion is much better than stock HTC sense), it's clear what sms app I will use as long as it's supported. Keep up the amazing work devs, hope to see more amazing projects from y'all soon!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Rotating screen while composing a message removes the recipient from the text. Sometimes opening app when a chat was open causes app to have a blank screen.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I don't like how there is a pop up on the top when there's a new text. If there was an option to just have a new message shown as a ticker in the notification bar instead of the pop up, I'd be in heaven! (yes I have the pop off option turned off already).",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My daily messaging app. My only gripes are sometimes it gets stuck sending a message and that there isn't a less obtrusive qkreply. I would prefer being able to slide from the top and reply there. Or maybe do something different with qkreply? If you're gonna give a simple pop up reply function that every app has a special name, I think you should differentiate yourself more.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really enjoy the app, one thing I really wish is that I am able to assign more than on color to different people. Group messaging is confusing with the same colors for everyone and the only way to tell who sent each message is to click on the details of the message.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My phone is dual sim and there is no option in this messaging app for Sim 1 and Sim 2 when I'm about to send a message. Please work on this one. Thanks 😁,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This may be my new favorite texting app. I tried it early in the year and it was too glitchy to use at all but now I have very few issues with it (froze/crashed a couple of times but still pretty stable). It has so many features but wish I could customize the look more but as long as it works well... who cares? Well done dev team!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's nice, but missing signature support (while some say that died long ago, I still use it for large group messages where not everyone has each other's number)       Also would like to see the ability to back up and restore texts.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Few issues I've noticed: The composed message gets wiped out on phone rotation. Clicking on message bubbles under appearance settings force closes the app. Toggles under general settings work in a weird way.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is a must !! Quickly Reply or mark as read right in the notification panel. Very materialistic design . Also comes with an awesome speed of sending messages .. One of a kind !!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This has everything you could/would want in a messaging app. Simplicity, pop-up window instant replay, and much more! Amazing, just amazing.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Wish it had the option to add new contact from messages. Love it though, and I am very picky about my messaging apps.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Only reason for giving 1 star less is that it isn't working with the moto display on my moto x 2014,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Too much battery usage. Vodafone smart ultra 6. Stock 5.0.2. Sent 100 texts and over 50 % of battery is gone. ( in textra it remains 75% in same conditions),4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app deals with lots of texts and has no problem with performance. Way better than Samsung's default app. Being able to get texts over my lock screen is also great,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's slower when opening conversations than other apps like EvolveSMS and Messenger.  I like to see time stamps on each message sent within a conversation like some other apps and speed improvements.  That would make it 5 stars for me.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Good looking app, just need to fix a couple things. First, the animation when you touch the 3 dots in the top right corner of the app is very laggy on the animation. Second, when you change the color of the app icon based on the theme you chose, it's still the default color when you multitask and see it in the recent apps. Running 6.0 Marshmallow. Otherwise it's one of the best messaging apps out there.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is probably my favorite texting app I've found thus far, but there's one thing that I can't stand about it. When my signal is too low it instantly tells me the message failed to send and it won't even try to send it. I've never had this issue in any other app and it happens to me constantly with this one. I would like it if it at least tried to send it or waited a little bit until the signal improves instead of giving up instantly. Also some more options for customization would be nice.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the simplicity, neatness and sophistication of this app, plus its being ad free. Hopefully on you next update, it's something to do with group messaging. Like most messaging apps, when sending a message to multiple people, aside from it showing on each receiver's thread, every message should be found in one thread so I don't need to retype the names of my receivers in every message I wish to send by group. I tried several messaging apps available in Google play store and even the default messaging app of my Sony Xperia C3 failed me in sending group messages for they can't cater long messages that are mostly sent in group, it keeps prompting error messages before a message is successfully sent. And I'm hoping that this messaging app is not like that. With your next update, hopefully you'll have several options for font styles like the choco cooky font style of Samsung phones for that's actually my frustration in my phone (At least I can achieve it through this messaging app). I really love this app that's why I'm making an effort to help in its improvement. Kudos QKSMS team!",5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Group messages don't work on the one plus one. It sends each person an individual message instead.

Update: to be the best you'd want feature parody with the best....So adding ios style emojis would be the biggest one. And I see some of the top reviews on here asking for the same thing.. Glad it's not just me... And also add a sent sound.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I had to switch from this to Textra due to massive performance issues, but the devs of this app fixed every issue I had with the latest update. A very nice looking and now performing app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Best messaging app by far, and no ads! Would be even better if notification icon colour can be changed and multiple attachements added to single mms.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Best of them all, and I have tried everything. Great customization and will actually have an option to wake the screen with a new message arrives, seeing that this is rare among 3rd party texting apps. Thanks so much for this app devs. Keep making apps that are as great as this one!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I dowloaded the app today and i am loving it. So far this is the fastest ive used. I havent fully explored it yet but so far i like it. :),5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Latest update keeps running in the background, draining battery.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,When I downloaded it it didn't show up on my moto 360,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,New version just crashes all the time. The old version was amazing,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Has all the features you could want. In built backup would be nice tho,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great alternative sms, devs are very responsive.  I am using this instead of Handscent and Textra.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very good. MMS is getting better too!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Been a looooong time user of QKSMS. Huge fan of this app :) So I use HeadsOff to receive ticker-style notifications rather than heads up. Ever since I updated QKSMS to the latest version, the notification doesn't show the sender's name and message - it shows, ""QKSMS: New message"" despite my privacy settings allowing the message to be shown.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Not open friends my samsung glaxy note1st,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It was a great messaging app, smooth and a good black theme (amoled). but after last update, i get wakelocks en the app uses a lot of CPU... :(",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I just downloaded the app and it won't get past the welcome page !,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great work,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Various bugs throughout the app.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Latest version restarting often clear the bug,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Group messaging doesn't work...,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Looks great.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Why it doesn't support dual sim??,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Awesome,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Awesome app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Been using Handcent for a long time. I love all of its customizations but want a material design. Would like this more if it had the same type of individual customizations like Handcent. Different color schemes, sounds, different bubble types for each contact texts to name a few. Make it more customizable and I will change the stars.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"In size, but super annoying. The popup for replies should only really come up if in app. Seeing the squished popup displayed over the actual conversation I'm replying to is a bit weird. Without this the app is five stars, this just really affects how I use an SMS app (want a popup when out of app so I don't have to open it to quick reply, want that popup closed automatically if the app is open and the current focus). Awesome in every other way.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App is gorgeous and simple... Would get 5 stars but its still buggy... Constantly fails to send my messages and i have to resend messages manually. App will show i got the message and after i exit app it will pop up with the quick reply showing the message i already got. If not for these minor bugs i would give 5 stars,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been looking for a decent SMS app and I do believe that I've found it! It's like the developer took the best parts of other SMS apps and combined them into this app! The one thing that would give it five stars for me is if there was a ""private"" box, to shield messages sent/received with certain contacts from someone other than myself looking at my messages.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The only reason I replaced my stock SMS app is because of it's ability to apply scheme colors. Pls. make transitions smoother since I do experience choppy ones. Also, add more background options and the option to put sound effects when sending SMS.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really love this app. But mms does not work sending or receiving. Please fix and I will rate 5 stars and donate because this app has everything else I want and love. Mms is a huge part of my texting and I need it to work. :/,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I wanted to love this app, it's quite pretty and has some great features. One that is missing if the ability to archive messages, but that is not why the poor review. The app force closes and crashes all the time on my Nexus 5 running stock ROM. Unacceptable.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Will modify my rating if unacceptable issues displayed in other reviews here start to show up (which apparently hasnt happened yet), but I find myself immediately impressed over the features and customization that it boasts while remaining functional. Donated to the developer almost immediately.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I've tried many sms this one looks good. Couple of things would make a brilliant app 1. Allow contrasting colours. 2. Give avatars material design colours. If no photo. 3. Seems strange to scroll threads up rather than down. Only been using this for a couple will do a more in depth review after a couple of days. Having used this app for s week now its great but why does it keep calling people I text? Had to stop using this because it keeps calling people I text,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very nice app, but there's 2 things I would need to ditch my other texting app for this one: 1- Having a reminder notification sound when I have unread messages, 2- Swipe to delete a conversation instead of a long press and selecting delete conversation. Other than that, great job!!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Finally gave qksms another shot since I just got a moto 360. It's much improved, even mms is working for me now (turned off the Automatic Data setting in mms settings and it works now). Only minor issue is it tends to lag a bit in messages where there are a lot of messages and there's no way to delete older messages.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like that it's open source and donation based. It's fantastic that it's adless. it works well enough, and the customization options are awesome. it isn't without problems though. the quick reply pop up sometimes displays the wrong conversation and group messaging can get very difficult to read as there isn't a lot of distinction between different sender's. other than that, for the most part it works well and has very few problems.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very nice! Simple, clean, does the job. I like: disabling showing useless avatars, setting much bigger font, setting black background and no ads at all. I'd like: the delete button next to check mark on the incoming message window.  It doesn't wake up my phone. A had to install SMS WakeUp, uninstall QKSMS, install again and then it works.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Hey there! I got this app because I saw you in an HH group. I really love using it, but I can never get MMS to work well. Sometimes it sends, but it never receives. This might be due to data being off, but it should let me know that's the case, as Textra does. Other than the MMS issue, this app is amazing. I'm on an HTC One m8. Nice work!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,' Everything is almost perfect except the Pop-Up thingy.. when it Pops out And Im on a Certain App or watching Video. Its very annoying that it pause of stops the app that Im in. Please fix this :),4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app design is very elegant, my favorite indeed. However, there are some annoying bugs. First when I try to update the app icon color to match the app theme, it just disappears. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix that. There's also an animation bug that causes the app to stutter when opening any conversation.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"If I go back to a message that I've previously sent an mms from, the image shown is incorrect. For example, if I send 5 images to one person, the next time I view that thread it will show all 5 images as being the same, but show the correct image when I touch it.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love your app. I just have some issues..sometimes the app does not show the name of the contact that texted me. Although ive got my friend's number saved in my phone. Other than that. Its super great!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great color theme options. Quick. If I could disable pop-up notifications while within the app itself, QKSMS would get 5 stars. I don't want SMS popups when viewing other conversations. Outside the app, they're welcome.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Couple suggestions, archive messages, more animations, for example when you delete or send a message its much smoother and faster, and a better notification icon, the white letter blends in with the card it needs to be changed to the theme color I'm using",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I has many issues. First one is if u use this app in dual SIM phone you have no option to chose the sim while   texiting and sending messages. Difficult to understand from which number or SIM we have recived the message. We cant forward the old message in this app. Its UI is good. If these issues fixed I will give 5 stars,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is well made and flows well. The only problem I have had is the app not recognizing that messages have been read and still showing the badge on the icon. Other than that one bug, no other issues with this app!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"But, I have been using handcent sms for quite a while, and it started lagging and taking up all my battery. So the quest for a new sms app happened. I stumbled upon this after quite a search, and it has almost everything I want, I just had one suggestion for a 5 star review, can you let us change the bubble colors for a specific person? Like, I may want yellow for one of my friends, but a blue for another. Is that possible?",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"For some reason the app shows every conversation in the main app, but refuses to show a particular conversation in the widget. Have restarted and reinstalled the app several times to fix the issue to no avail. Otherwise it's a perfect app for messaging for me ^_^",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's definitely a beautiful app with everything I'm  looking for, but for some reason it won't show the name of some of my contacts,  and they just appear as a number. Once that's fixed,  it's a definite 5 stars",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The top status bar doesn't change to a flat color like stock lollipop. Instead it has that ugly gradient from KitKat, even when selecting the ‘flat' option.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Performance, appearance and usability are all on point, but I can't seem to get the long press menu for any message with a link or number in it...",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is pretty good, but the only issue for me is when I press on the quick settings menu, they flash up as they're supposed to and then get replaced by ""..."" for some reason. Please fix the issue.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Gentleman STILL NO private message box? I hate to be repetitive but you guys are missing A HUGE amount of users by not adding that. Please include one, cause you guys would be the best app out with that small addition. Would rate 5stars no question.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Hey i like the app alot its beautiful and works well. One suggestion is being able to change the font color. Just something to customize a little more. But other than that no complaints,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It also has my favorite feature mark as read.  But it needs to delete single messages and also way to forward recieved messages.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's pretty and I like the customization but still missing necessary features I would need to be my daily driver. I hope they keep on developing.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I prefer this one over the Google messaging app, more color options, plus night mode and delayed messages are great",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very happy with this SMS app. Currently my daily driver. Just one bug where when you exit and reopen app where it says conversations it will still have the last person I texted name.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Found it on reddit a while ago. It's a lovely and to the point app full of customisable features. Would like to see the ability to put custom hexes for the colors,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really good messenger app, I've only had problems with the widget showing conversations from months back no current messages show, the pop up box freezes sometimes Lg3. Overall very good!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is pretty good for sms, but crashes whenever there is an mms message sending, if this gets fixed i will increase my rating. Overall still a good sms app with nice themes.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"For my replies please add ""You:"" so I know if I have replied. Or fix the dot where new messages have come! Its rather annoying",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I would give this app five stars if it adds features such as scheduled sms and the ability to add custom backgrounds,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This would be and could be the best texting app I've used if MMS actually worked. I'd even donate if it gets fixed. Otherwise I love the ui and options.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Its so confusing how can i set the sim1 and sim2 messages i tried and i search alot in the QK SMS setting but i didn't find the option to set the messages sent sim.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this simple app, and thanks for making it free and open sourced. The only issue I've discovered is it sometimes doesn't notify for new messages, and pictures do not get sent all the time with the Share option (from the gallery app for example).",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"There is a problem with the widget. When it's set to white background, the widget sometimes just shows the avatars and not the text. Overall widget display issues.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Developers won't return my contact to help remove notifications from home screen after text conversations have been deleted. Other than that, the app is adequate.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really nice sms manager,  but I wish it had a feature that told you if the other person had viewed your message and at what time (if this does exist can some one tell me how to activate it?). Other then that it gets a thumbs up from me.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love the feel and look of this app. It just lags a lot right after sending a text. Hopefully it gets fixed with the next update. If so I would give 5 stars. I can't wait!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have been having issues with MMS. Occasionally the MMS messages won't show up in the thread, or will disappear. Sometimes my MMS messages don't get sent. I will leave a proper review and update once this bug gets fixed. So far I like it!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Its starting to take long when I click on a specific message to view details it takes about 4 seconds. Also when a message is sending it says ""sending"" even once you close the app n even minutes after. The sending doesn't go away until you send another message. I",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Too many bugs to use it as a replacement. Typing area much to small for long messages.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Dev fixed my complaint within a week.  Great job!  I really like this app.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Why is their a donate button on every page that doesn't work and crashes the app? Why can't I delete more than one text at a time? This app has so much potential but lacks in a lot of places. I would love to use this app some more but lacks so much. I hope it gets better one day.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this application, the customization is great... However, when I use it my data will not turn off. I don't know if it's a MMS issue through this application, but I can't use it because it's using my data no stop. Please fix!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the fluidity, but should have the option to customize different colors for different contacts (like Google's messenger app). Also, the ability to make the text box full screen to see a large message you are typing is a great feature.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Whenever I get a text the screen will turn on from the notification and not turn off at all. Burns through battery. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. I loved this app but this is a critical problem.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great job by dev to fix crashes very quick after reporting. Would like to have automatic removal of old messages past a certain amount.  Also, the auto-enabled data connection to get MMS doesn't always disable after retrieval.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It almost has all the configuration options I want in a texting app. However, these should be implemented: Different shaped/sized text bubbles and options to use background wallpaper. Even the default SMS app gives us that. It would be awesome in this app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love all of the features! Especially putting the phone up to my ear to call, that's very creative!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's been very unstable. Keeps freezing and crashing,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app! But I found a bug - every time after app's icon colour update the icon disappears from the screen or place where I put it. It remains only in main menu.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"There's no method for sending feedback. Almost every time I open the app, it presents a dialogue telling me the MMS settings have been set and congratulations. Otherwise beautiful, simple, good control of service.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,5 stars for no advertising 😁 Love it being open source.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Need work on animation - stutters from conversation list to conversation on GS6,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is smooth, fast and easy to use. Does not have a lot of bloated options or themes. Can't copy and paste text, can't save photos. Reducing my rating to 3 stars. Moving back to Messenger.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Fix the group chats and all the app crashes please.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very good SMS app. Less relevant now that Signal is out.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I liked this app till I figured out it was the cause for poor battery life,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Frequently force closes, receives most mms messages but not all.. had to install it.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the app but it continuously crashes on my gf's 2nd gen moto x and causes the phone to temporarily freeze with the screen just black.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Seems good, like the UI, but some of my contact pictures didn't import into QK, despite it working in other messaging apps and the pics being assigned in my Contacts. Any advice?",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Gorgeous open source SMS app that neither made any ugly tradeoffs nor went with feature creep.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Would like to see a way of scheduling messages and adding someone's contact info to a text.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is what I've been looking for in an SMS client for years! Thanks Moez for creating this! Just needs a few stability optimizations for OPO and life is perfect 😊,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Pretty good app overall. Multi-select option is a basic feature. Once that's added, this a five star app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like the app. Its fast, beautifull and has many usefull features. I will rate 5 stars once you add auto colour per contact like on aosp messaging app, I really love that feature. Great app!!",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Uninstalling since MMS doesn't work 100%.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Is there any way i can have all of my messages in one notification like before instead of displaying each message for each individual contact?,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,You keep making a good app better. Hopefully all the bugs will be worked out soon.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love this app. Used many other messaging apps but there was always something I didn't like. So far I am loving it, except that the transitions arent very smooth. That's the only thing I would say is a con. Please, smoother transitions. Update!",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app only recognizes photos from my contacts saved to my Google account. Any of my contacts (the majority) that are synced from Facebook won't use the Facebook photo my contacts uses. This is annoying as every conversation just has a solid circle beside it.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Exceptional. Popups with quick reply so no need to switch apps. Super customizable, including the app icon itself. Messaging delays (for those drunk texts I guess). Overall the best amalgamation of what I loved about Ninja SMS and other top messaging apps.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Tried it before, the features I wanted were pay. Deleted. Now that it's free I'm enjoying it fully and customizing it fully and I like it a lot! After a week of use if it still is good then I'll donate to help the Devs. Update after a couple days. It has started lagging significantly, and is becoming a bother to use. Not impressed anymore. Switching back to default app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My GF texted me, and the quick reply wasn't even labeled to her. It was for a completely different person. Also sometimes when I open a conversation to someone I've been talking to it'll be completely blank. It won't even have the person's name on the top, and after I exit the app and reopen it it's fine.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Hello, please add the ability to choose to quick reply from a locked screen. I have a S4 and the wake screen does not work.  I have a pebble watch and I do not receive notifications through my pebble when received on the app on my phone. Would like the option to change the font and bubble styles. Maybe later add the ability to make more changes to the background to place my own images. The contact information takes a while to update to the person's contact name when opening the app. So far no major issues.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the app but for some reasons, some numbers are not recognised. So i will receive a text and it will show the number instead of the name even though it's a savew contact. That's pretty annoying not knowing who texted you. Not sure if it's just me being silly. Any help would be appreciated.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Since the update, everytime I try to even get into the app it doesn't work. I can't get into it at all.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love it; except it crashes on me at least a few times a day. Sometimes while in the background,  sometimes while replying,  or while typing.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Hi there! Love the app. It is hands down my favourite messaging app on my phone.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,where can i change the dual sim settings?? or is this only good for single sim phone??,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Nice texting app. Clean design and ui. Two features it could use are: option to select iPhone emoji, and rejoining split messages (e.g., AT&T to Verizon). Update: I really want to like this app, but after using it for a bit it's not quite ready for prime time. Trouble attaching and deleting pics, deleting conversations, lack of notification of new messages and so on. Still some bugs to be worked out.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The design is nice but I feel plain (considering other text/sms applications). I really like Evolve and Go SMS, but feel there are too many glitches with those apps. QK seems to have strong functionality but I would like to be able to add my own background images as well as to be able to insert files that are saved on my device. I LOVE the delayed message option that another user recommended. i TRIED USING IT AND IT DID NOT WORK. This frustrates me. I need one ""reliable"" text app with features that both enhance and enrich the experience. This is an OK app and needs some work.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great features...EXCEPT... It is using way to many precious resources and constantly restarting. Can't delete messages automatically, takes too long. Pictures load incredibly slow and no video support to send even short videos.I do love the popup text alert box and instant response even when in another app. t is by far its best feature. But the other issues have me searching for something better.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have had issues with older versions that seem to have been fixed.  Recently, when qksms is open, and another message comes in, the notifier still pops up (with no message in it) requiring you to close the pop up to respond.  Seems awful glitchy for a paid app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"MMS functionality in the app is still a bit wonky, and the widget glitches out a good bit (and updates very infrequently). Really my only complaints. Everything else is top notch. The slight delay after hitting send is absolutely genius.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is super clean fluid and very user friendly. You can customize most things but not as much as some apps...I prefer it this way though, because it gives the app a unified modern look. It has the best pop up notification window out of any texting app. The major flaw which makes me remove 2 stars is the fact that it takes forever for photos to be sent while some don't ever send and you can't send video at all. Guess I'll have to keep looking for that perfect texting app....this was so close.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"But it desperately needs an option to automatically delete old messages i.e. Limit a thread to 500 messages. The app seems to lag pretty hard in conversations with thousands of messages,  and it's not really feasible to manually delete that many messages. I have to keep switching to other sms apps and use them to automatically delete old messages, before switching back",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,love the interface and notification options. two issues I'm having: screen does not wake up when receiving a notification. also the icon colour in the notification bar remains white despite altering it in settings. please fix for 5 star rating.,4

All of these new Material Design based SMS apps seem to have one fatal flaw each, if this one is fixed, it'd be perfect.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app. No ads love it. Make it where we can change the font please please please. And more colors and customize single contacts.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,5 stars if it worked. Never woke the screen even though I had it turned on in the settings. Removed the contact from the message repeatedly causing me to close the thread then go back into it.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the app and its looks good work dev. Since the latest update however after I send a message instead of reverting back to + it reverts into T. Just looks a bit out of place.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Every time I go into the app, certain names will show up as just the phone number even though when I click the portrait area to bring up the profile it shows their name. Will not pay until this is fixed",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app. Just wish that I could change the font to my system font. Please make this an option.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This is wonderful but I was hoping that there would be an option where you could select more than one contacts to be messaged. Thanks,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app seems to be better than Textra. Also made by EVERYONE,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I have one wish; can you add support for dual sim phone?,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,just made it as my default msg app... i hope u had already fixed d add recipient bar esp. on d black theme.. d letters and d box are same in color. but overall it was great. kipup!!!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Not localised for the UK?  Menus just have ... for them.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I installed this earlier and so far I am really liking it! I like that when I open it it says Conversations instead of the regular QKSMS. It looks like an actual messaging system. I like how it is clean and how lovely the interface is, I like the colors available and I will be using this as my default messenging app now and if I don't run into any problems with is app then I will purchase pro version. Thank you for this great app!! 😊",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,1. I use action launcher.... And I'm using custom color app icon based on theme in QKSMS.... The issue is that every now and then the icon from home screen gets erased. And i need to make its shortcut again and again 2 .In compose mode when background color is set dark gray or black....I can't see suggested contacts while typing recipient name. No problem when it's white or of white.  I love dark gray mode though and really want this big fixed. 3. delete button for new SMS received in notification drawer.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Nice relatively fast app. Like that new messages pop up for rapid response. Poor handling of group messages though. Frequently splits them into separate conversations with each member, and won't show new group texts in notification bar.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The app takes between 5-15 seconds to load contact name/image whenever the app is opened. That should be cached info. Please fix that and I'll actually be able to enjoy this otherwise great app.  Happens on both aosp and stock lg roms.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like the feel of this app.  I miss having blacklist though, and may opt for a different app for this important feature.  Because this is the most important tweak I need right now, its the only one I'll mention just yet.  Would be worth supporting paid version for this.  Does mute conversation effectively work like blacklist? That would be cool... Thank you.... Alright another important missing feature: can't send audio files, no audio record button.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It really is awesome. The night mode and markdown are such a bonus. The only thing I wish would be changed is the quick reply. It is annoying how it pops right in front of you. Maybe this could be a setting where you can tap the notification to use the quick reply? That's my only criticism as this app is incredible. I downloaded it to try after I read an article on the dev. Awesome work!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It appears that there is no google group contact integration.  Until this is in place I'll stick with other sms apps,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app, but there a a few things that should be changed 1.When notification is received, the reply and read options should be able to be switched off. 2. in a conversation,  when a long message is sent or recieved, it shouldn't stretch to the other side of the screen but instead it should stretch downwards",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,When the pop up notification pop up it doesnt give me a chance to type anything and when i try to open a text it wont let me open it until i go out of the app also it doesnt alert me when i receive a text and why is scrolling so difficult...its kind of irritating and slow textra is better,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It doesn't seem to be changing to a darker color for a more Material Design. It just makes the notification bar the same color and adds an ugly shadow.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'm really liking QKSMS having only installed it recently. It's extremely fast, which I can't say about some other apps (ahem, mysms), and its completely free with no annoying ads! It also handles the T-Mobile WiFi calling MMS conflict the best out of any app I've seen! The only problem I have with it is when you're in night mode and go to enter a recipient for a new text, the search results are in white text on a white background, so you can't see who you're choosing, womp.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's taking so long at app startup and most of my contacts doesn't show their avatars (or profile pics??). And its still a little bit laggish while scrolling through messages. It's very amazing and fast app overall. Keep going! But pls fix !!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The dark gray and black themes cause the suggested contacts to be unreadable when composing a new message. Otherwise good.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Add kik quick reply please,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Emoji please? I need emojis for texting thank you. Please don't ignore this,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I don't like this because this app has no emoji,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,How can i send group messaging?it keeps on failing..,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love itt!!!! Best one yet!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Literally, Perfect",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I used to have it on my device via a code, before i reset my phone. How do I go about getting it back",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I forget why I had stopped using this app but I decided to give it another try, re-installed and WOW! Tons of new improvements & the updated UI looks fabulous. I especially 💖 how the app let's you change its system icon color to match your theme color. And most important of all: pop-ups for new messages. Great app 👍👍👍👍👍",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Chose this over Chomp as it looks better. Problems start when notifications don't come through and the last message received isn't shown until you rotate the device landscape then back to portrait. Fix these showstoppers and its a five star rating from me,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app. Almost enough to make it my default messaging app. The only thing keeping it back is the way it handles picture messages. It doesn't seem intuitive or user friendly at all. Now it very well could be me and not the app, but it's the only messaging app that I've had this particular trouble with.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is incredibly well designed, and would be perfect except for two issues that make it borderline unusable. First thing, there's no option for notification sounds to repeat, so I might not get the message until I happen to look at the screen possibly hours later. Every dumbphone I ever had could do that, so it seems almost ridiculous that I've been using this app for almost two years and the feature still hasn't been added. And secondly, the ""Automatic data"" option for MMS is broken. Just completely.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It would be almost perfect if the crashes were fixed. Tends to happen when switching between threads.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"A no nonsense sms app that works.Very easily setup only gripe that it could have different speech bubble colours on incoming and outgoing messages,also maybe be able to change the background to an image.Just cosmetic changes,but in all its the best sms app I have tested so far",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have searched for a sms app that has such a customizable ui, such as this one. Excellent layout. Fast and simple. Already recommended it to all my friends.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Getting better! It doesn't handle group mms messages as well as other apps (like Google Messenger).,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App is good enough to pay for. And that is saying a lot from a cheapskate like me! Open source is a big plus too.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Completely crashes on startup for Samsung Galaxy s5. Please fix!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Would be nice to have different colors per contact,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Awesome Design and Features, but needs more Stability",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Under thread view there is no option to delete individual sms. Please include the feature.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It still crashes!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Good.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a 4.5 star app however there is quite a serious design flaw : the message editing box can only show 3 lines of text & it's hard to scroll. Should be larger or dynamically readjust based on message length. In the same way, you can't preview your full msg during a delayed send which is unhelpful.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app so far is quite satisfactory. I've tried many messaging apps and have paid a whole lot for themes and extensions but this app so far is a little ahead of the pack. Ability to change bubble styles would be awesome. I changed my rating to 3 stars because my screen still doesn't wake up unless I have the pop up option on.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Only a few bugs (that are fixed now), but still an amazing app that is worth the download and is way better than my default Samsung messaging app and the best one I've found on he play store with a beautiful user interface. Thanks QKSMS!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"First, I love the way this app looks. Fantastic job devs. Why does everyone make ugly sms apps??  Second, I would absolutely love if they could take their quick reply feature, and add in a ""heads"" feature. Similar to hoverchat and Facebook's messenger app. Please tell me this is on the way. Third, sending, receiving and viewing picture messages can be kinda buggy, but I'm sure they will fix it. Once those two are fixed/added it will be 5 all the way",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I don't know if this is possible...but the app would look much better if you used an iPhone style reply. The heads up notifications could become the reply center for this. Other than that great work.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"when I go to the message app from a notification, I can't click or long click on any conversation. I have to go back to the home screen and restart the app for it to work.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I want to get off Textra but can't send images with QKSMS. Textra wins out.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The new update is great but the unread count doesn't work very well. The unread count froze at 2,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This apps really looks great but somehow a bit laggy for my liking.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When qk reply opens, it acts like another app and stops the one your on! For example, if your on clash of clans, the qk reply will open and it will stop the game and you might need to reload the game if your not a quick typer.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is simply the best looking texting app on the play store, really wish I could send a file other than a picture,  but they're fleshing it out nicely.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Notifications aren't sounding even though the setting is on and the phone is set to ring.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Group messaging and sending pictures does not work on this app even tho I changed the setting and enabled the group messaging,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app group mms with the quick reply is a little wonky but besides that it's all good!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Add more customization. Realy liked the app. Erased all my recent messagig app for ths qksms. experiencing some bugs but totally worth it I hope the more you update it wont crash like the other sms apps. Good job!!!!! Gonna use this from now on!!!!!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Freezes and blank screens often...,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Can't delete from within a conversation.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's far better than the “regular android"" default messaging app. If Android wants to do it's customers some justice, they should team up with QK! That would be one heck of a collaboration!!!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice replacement for the standard client,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"QKSMS looks great and if not for some functional issues with group messages and night view mode, it would likely be able to replace my main texting app. As of now I cannot find a way of viewing everyone on a group message easily, and with a lot of group texts I cannot keep track of the conversations in any reasonable way in QKSMS. A recent update fixed the night mode issues I was having.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Hands down the most beautiful texting app on Android. However small bugs really detract from the overall experience. Sometimes SMS and MMS messages from one contact will temporarily appear in another conversation if you quickly switch conversations. Also, entire conversations sometimes temporarily disappear when opening the app through quick reply. It's these small clunky bugs that really hold this app back from being one of the best. Using LG G4",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I was looking for something to replace Textra since I hate the updated Textra. I found QKSMS and I love it. It is what I liked about the previous Textra and more. I only wish there was an option that Textra had; to change the return button on the keyboard to ""Send"" instead of having to hit the send button next to your message. Which would then make the keyboard go away after clicking send. Only option I see is to turn that button into Emoji's and I do not want that. Other than that it is great!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Sometimes when getting a message, there is a notification, but the pop up shows someone else's previous message. Or blank. Same thing when selecting a conversation thread in the app. It will show blank, or another contacts messages. Gets confusing. Sometimes messages are received and never got a notification as well. Still like it alot, but I need something that is stable, so I'm shopping around still. Chomp sms is pretty good, except delivery notifications don't work. So who ever fixes the bugs I guess.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It would be great to have the possibility to copy not only a complete message or numbers but to manually select any kind of text within sent or received messages. - otherwise a great app!! It grows better and better and the developer is really behind it, permanently delivering good and useful Updates. And it's ridiculously highly customizable.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It is great when it works correctly, but half of the time it starts group texts when I just send pictures to one person and when the pop up window comes up it doesn't show who sent the text it shows who I texted last even if they did not text me. Way too many bugs.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Is there IOS emoji support? And I've disabled quick reply but even when I press reply in the drop down notification it brings up quick reply. I want it to go into the full app. Also should be able to browse pictures and stuff through the app not using a 3rd party app. Apart from that its pretty nice,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Needs essential features like timed messages and multiple notifications. Menus/msg bubbles need animations so as to be less jarring. Colored navbar has a visual glitch if the navbar height is changed from default (via custom rom/xposed...) Been a happy user since the beta but pls fix bugs and add functionality qkly!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very smooth, great for replacing stock sms app.  One problem I am having is that I cannot see all of the names of people involved in a group message (or at least I haven't figure it out).  Hopefully this can be addressed in an upcoming update.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's a really nice looking app.  I love how you can customize it pretty much to your liking. I just hope you can add an archive feature. Also when you scroll through your conversations it kinda lags a bit so I hope it gets fixed as well.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Big fan of the app, I highly recommend it.  I cannot get mms to work though.  I've tried manually configuring but with no luck.  I contacted support a few days ago but never heard back.  I hope this gets fixed soon.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app. It's far better than the stock Samsung Messenger. However, ever since I switched, I haven't been recieving MMS messages. I've configured my MMS several times over, with no avail. Please help.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've tried Textra, Evolve, Hangouts, Messenger, etc, etc. None are like this one. Want to remove the stupid avatars while SMS? Cool, do it. Want to do tabbing? Lol no problem. You feeling blue today? Doesn't matter to me, change your color. Do you like quick reply but hate quick compose? Go ahead and make it that way. Like LED alerts? Fine, you have like 6 different colors to chose from. Like privacy and notifications? Screw it, block all those sexts and still get notifications. *MMS doesn't work though :(",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Many of my conversation are lost. at the end when I'm ready to close there is no send icon and when I tap to look for it your app just loses the whole conversation and my time is wasted. this happens way too often. I just had your app delete a whole message while I was trying to find your damneud send icon. there never is a send icon buddy!   The second point is a good programmer never deletes anything obviously vital without asking for a confirmation! not asking is just PMS!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'll be sending an email with a bug report, one thing I would like is a contact us within the app, I would love to continue using this app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Responsive, beautiful and tons of options. I love simple minimalist design and this interface does that in a beautiful way. Utilises the google material philosophy and is what google hangouts should have been.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's a shame. I really loved this app. But once I got the update to 5.0.2 the app became really unstable. Crashing almost all the time I use it. Very frustrating. Switching back to default messaging system for now.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is clean, functional, and has a quick reply feature that works better than other apps. Just about no complaints, it was money well spent. The only issue is that the shortcut on my home screen (GEL) deletes itself on restart.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But sometimes my font changes color. I have a dark red text background color for me and sometimes what I've typed is white and sometimes it's black and hard to read. It's random when it does this too.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When writing text you can then not add a picture and convert the message to an mms, you must first delete all of your text and add a picture first. This should be a feature as many sms apps do this (like Handcent). This needs to be emplemented please.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This the best texting app I've found but MMS doesn't work which defeats the entire purpose of the app, people want a reliable texting app, please fix in an update soon.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like to have more customization options.   Backgrounds and notification icons.   Other than that it flows nicely,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is the only app whose update notes I look forward to reading. The devteam definitely seems to consider every feedback. Thanks so much, guys!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app, but it never completes sending an MMS. I have to switch  to another app for it.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really love this app.  It works great and looks fantastic.  I do wish that the contact icons were colored separately from the overall theme just to make it look a little nice.  Overall, fantastic!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I'm so proud of u guys! but i found a bug tho. it wont allow me to pick a shade of color within one color. (i got the plus version),5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Got the code from Reddit! A billion thanks x! The only problem I've noticed however, is that since I installed, I repeatedly get a notification that my mobile data is switched off. Please fix and I'll rate 5 again :-)",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Bugs I've noticed so far is that the app does not actually delete messages, I have another SMS app and I go in all the messages I thought I deleted with QK are still there. Theres NO notification of received MMS when data is disabled. When going back into the app when i have a new sms the sms doesnt show up, its blank. And is there any way to make the send icon a little smaller? I think it would fit in well with the overall look of the app. Also, an option to auto enable data when sending and receiving MMS?",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the app! How about an option regarding the look of the text bubbles. To be able to curve the edges would be brilliant! Like the way it is in Facebook messenger! :),5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Exactly what I've been looking for! Smooth and great personalization options.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Everything is amazing!  Thanks for adding saving mms. Can you also add more vibration settings and  color wheel LED customization? This app is becoming perfect every update!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Delayed send doesn't stay disabled.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Currently multiple pictures sent as a single mms display as a slideshow. There should be an option to display them individually,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Its nice.. But there no private message..😎,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,great but lags on my s6 😱,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love ui and app works sooo fine. *****,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Scrolling isn't very smooth,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Switched to QKSMS+ from Handcent,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Perfect,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I had been using textra for a while. But since I saw the UI didn't get any updates I started looking for something else and this one came up. It is great but it's a bit buggy and needs some more personalization features. One feature needed urgently: send voice notes and contacts in vCards and plain text modes.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app. Sleek and visually appealing. Should add a list select and delete all option. &lt;3 listened to my last request,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I dont know if it was my comment about the locked message that you saw but still i was grateful! Lastly, i dont know if its just me but the coversation list is not that fluid when scrolling. But all in all, great sms replacement!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I would like to be able to delete multiple conversations. I also get messages and never know I got them.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Indeed a great app. But it should be smoother, there is still significant lag present. Fix that and it's 5 stars",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great features but just one downfall keeps on crashing on regular bases,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Mms problems are the only downfall to this app.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Tried the app, spent two days with the plus version and.. mehh. I like they have themes There are some cool features.But it's a little choppy with my HTC m8.. also can't attach pictures from anything but gallery. Doesn't have auto remind. Miss a msg, and your own your own",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Tried this app out using the reddit giveaway.  It's a good start and has all the functionality that most people would like in an SMS app. Unfortunately it has some bugs that preclude it from being the SMS app of choice, most notably, sometimes you'll tap into a conversation, and it will just be blank.  All in all, it's a decent start, and I love the community engagement. Good luck!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I rarely get any notifications that I have received a text message. Sometimes I see that I already had a reply but still there was no notif. Also the notif of sent message does not seem to work. I would greatly appreciate the improvement. Such sleek and simple design. Good job on that :),3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I just want to say this is such a nice SMS app from the rest. The material design and the ability to customize the text appearance and them is amazing!  My only concern is in the Quick Reply popup, the chatbox can't utilize Swiftkey keyboard (or any other) swipe-texting methods. Please fix this and this app will be the best on the market!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Every time I restart my phone the shortcut for the icon disappears. Same after running SD Maid.  Gets laggy on larger conversations.  The quick reply pops up even if you're in the same conversation.  If these would be addressed this would be my main texting app.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've only been using this app for about a week now but I really like it. It's a lot like textra but I consider textra a bit more polished and QK still needing some work. I do have a couple of things that I noticed while using QK, it doesn't have a setting for audible reminders if you missed your text and when I send a text but don't close the app I get a pop up of the response on top of the conversation list, why the pop up just add the response to the open conversation. I'm sure QK will keep getting better",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is great and has some huge potential. Now however the app is too buggy for regular use.. I especially have problems with the app quoting every time I switch be tween exe conversations. When most of the bugs are worked out this will be a 5 star review!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I am really enjoying just about everything with this app. It's quick, the heads up notifications work really well and the lot. But there are a couple big issues for me: 1) Auto night mode is not consistent, and the text does not change to a contrasting color without backing out of or force restarting the app. 2) MMS works well, for receiving messages, but they are displayed as this ludicrously small slide show at the top of the screen. Why can't I look at each image individually and zoom?",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"To be fair my phone is old so that's not the apps fault. However not having a text reminder is a big deal breaker for me. Also texting and navigating the app seems laggy. Speaking of lag I always close apps when I'm done with them, having to constantly reload all the convos and contact pictures makes the experience feel slow. Mind you it's not a very long load but it is still noticeable. I want to love this app unfortunately I'd I think I'll be using textra. Despite using textra I'll be getting qksms+ :)",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"At first, this app seems great! A clean interface with a good amount of customization. Unfortunately, after using it for a while some ugly bugs started showing up. After receiving a message, it occasionally will not show up in the message thread until closing the app and running it again. Additionally, for group chat when a message is received, the notification won't properly load the app when tapped. It loads the person's thread instead of the group message thread. With some bug fixes, this could be great!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really the only problem I have with this app, is the quick reply popup will still appear even if I have the conversation open.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I switched from textra and this is cool but it seems unpolished. The group messaging is weird and it crashed often.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Big issue with a main feature. Someone message history will show up blank. Hopefully this will be resolved soon or I will have to resort to another messenger application.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Would love the ability to have sent messages and received messages two different colors rather than the default when unchecked. Light and simple app.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Often shows a blank screen when I open the app, need to restart my phone to fix it. Also MMS is spotty and the pop-up notification isn't always for who should be showing",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Whenever I get a new text the notification has the most recent conversation... But when I open the app, the newest text is missing. I have to exit and renter the app to have it show the newest text. This happens ALL THE TIME.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Still obviously being developed, but lacking features. Please add an option to add someone to my contacts from message thread.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Sorry I do like the app but until I can get rid of the smiley key its no good to me,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,When im using pop up to make a quick reply . Sometimes does not sending . Please fix this . Please,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love everything about this app except that I have issues with MMS, please fix that. For now I'll have to switch back to Textra.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The app has a black bar at the bottom which stops me seeing all of the app. It's like its forcing a navigation bar onto my device which has hardware buttons.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,One little request... Could you please put a white speech bubble on an off white background where your texts come up as you type... So little I know but then would be absolutely perfect.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Got this app when you posted it to reddit the other week.  Randomly get a message saying unfortunately app has stopped responding,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"... scrolling through the messages list  seems a bit laggy on my OPO. I managed to fix my MMS issues, though. Still there's a few things that need to be polished for it to be usable on a day-to-day basis.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Sometimes when I open it it's completely blank. I have to force close then reopen. It's annoying.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Everytime I get a picture message it applies to all the contacts that send me a picture and when I click on the picture is a totally different picture. Please fix it and it lags sometimes. Will give it 5 stars!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Definitely needs a sending animation. It's so much more pleasant than just a sudden change in the text you're looking at. Also, the conversation drawer isn't really material either. It's barely even holo.",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, but status bar ticker isn't working. Still gives me heads-up notifications",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Some ways to improve is to able to  flick up the notification that appears at the top but still keep it in the notifications center.  It stays for far too long and sometimes I just want to get it out of the way but still see the icon in the notification bar,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This is a great app and it is my default messaging app too but I will give you five stars if you had a batch deletion feature. A app this good it is hard to start deleting messages one by one so guys help me out.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"SMS is a little shoddy, but I like. Add option in quick reply to show more of the conversation automatically instead of having to expand it.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The app does everything I could ask for and I paid for the Qksms + to get the colors and features. The developer is young but is very active in the community and listens to his users. Best messaging app I've used and I came from Textra,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Qk is nice but nothing close to being as smooth as textra and hello SMS. This app stutters too much when scrolling down or up.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Can't even save pictures. Grrrr,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,floating sms pleasssse update to that,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,1) Add unread message count on icon of app... (2) add schedule sms option .... (3) add sms sending delay option ...!!!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,loving the app but can't seem to save pictures that are sent to me??? help.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Good but a few bugs,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Mms working much better,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Contact names are not showing up. Just numbers. Also, no option to add new contacts using the app",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Heads up Notifications??,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"A great app with the color customization I have been searching for. Just have two problems: 1. The avatars for my contacts won't show pictures, it only shows the first letter of their name. I have synced contacts with Facebook and LinkedIn, but still no luck.  2. I would love to see a widget. With the same color options as the app, that is what would put it ahead of the competition and would make this a 5 star app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Coming from textra, I wanted an SMS application that also has reliable MMS. Textra didn't give me that. QK is slow and cluncky and pretty buggy. The battery drain is horrendous. But the biggest problem is the lag and slowness.  I'm on HTC one m7 5.0.2",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app does a lot of the things that I wish Google's stock messenger would do (HD contact photos, notification light, nice UI tweaking options, etc) while still maintaining some of the nice features found in both Messenger and Textra. The UI lagged a bit when quickly scrolling and during some animations and I wish it had the option to swipe to delete/archive messages, but overall it's solid",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"*Mostly* functional and beautiful, this app still lacks core functionality needed to fully replace the stock SMS.     It's missing the ability to delete all messages or selectively delete certain messages in a mass.     Also missing is the ability to save MMS.     The quick reply is nice, but I turned off the auto pop-up function because it would still pop up even if I was in the app. Under some circumstances it would pop up for the current thread I was in. The quick reply should not appear automatically if I'm in the app.   The application icon is oversized and doesn't exactly fit material design standards. would be nice if it looked more similar in size to other material design icons.   Aside from these few blaring issues I don't have many other gripes about this app. Could be a little bit quicker, but it's not horrible.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Switched from Textra, but missing a lot of the functionality (quick camera, scheduling texts to name a few). It would also be nice if the scrolling bar wasn't so thick and obnoxious (detracts from the clean look of everything else)",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is great but has one small problem. It won't remove the icon showing how many unread messages I have even though I've seen them all. (These are in a group text which is mms),4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I can't use this app :( the reason why is because I have bad service at my house. If I don't have service to send a text, googles texting app messenger and many other texting apps will wait until there's service to send the message. Can you PLEASE add this feature. It's unusable for me until you do. And I think it's the most beautiful app out there.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love how beautiful and functional QKSMS is, but there are a few problems I've noted. 1. The quick reply screen comes up even if you're already in the app, which is annoying. 2. Night mode does not work all the time, with some colors changing and others not.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app force closes moving from one conversation to another. I've send the crash dumps, hopefully will be fixed soon.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've had one bug, and the active devs make me very confident that it'll be fixed",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Been on board with QKSMS since the early days and I can't say enough about the great, super helpful dev and his work. Great app, and I am certain it will only get better.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It always force closes and it's getting really annoying. other that, good app",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Unfortunately, contact names are not shown and only their numbers appear. After so many updates, I think it's time they fix this ridiculous bug!",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Only problem is ""automatic night mode"" isn't working. It goes ""dark"" when I set the time only, and after reopening the app I get the normal white background.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Aesthetically pleasing and quite fluid. Quick reply works well. MMS messages are it's Achilles heel at present, taking forever to send and receive.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is so smooth and the colour support makes you fall in love with themes again! 5/5 definitely would recommend!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Maybe I'm missing something but it'd be nice if there were a way to delete multiple messages at once. If that's already possible just let me know.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It says that it has stopped working and goes to the home screen.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When you change the colour scheme and icon colour it doesn't change the card in recents in lollipop, it remains the original colour scheme. It would be nice if that was addressed.  But still a great app with excellent customisation :)",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I used Hangouts, and then Messenger, because I was loyal to the brand. This is so much better, for many, many reasons.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Devs are awesome, this app has everything you could ask for and more.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It should have the repeat message alert option that the stock messaging app has.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,best app for sms,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great work,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Got QKSMS+ from a Reddit post last night that the dev made and gave 5000 keys away. Making this my daily SMS driver for the time being. Thanks dev. :D,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Clean, simple, ad-free texting app. However I would like to see the option of batch editing/deleting. Or at least deleting old messages without it scrolling back down to the bottom every time. One major glitch : every picture in every thread is showing as either a picture of my favorite ice cream shop or one of my favorite British actors. Could be worse, but I would like to see the actual pictures. I have to click on the picture and open it in photos to see what it really should be.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I actually love this app. It's a clean setup, intuitive layout, and it just looks great. Only problem is that it doesn't handle mms very well, at least on my phone (oneplus one on AT&T). I'll get group texts days later, if at all. I've tried messing with the ATN settings to no avail. If this is addressed, I will update immediately to 5 stars",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This application is okay, but no matter what I do,  I can't send nor receive picture messages (I am with T-Mobile) .  This really bothers me.   Also,  the ugly gradient shadow bothers me,  too.  I'm on Android 5.0.2 (Samsung Galaxy S6 edge). Can't get the flat style notification bar to show.  Probably only for Nexus devices? Then again,  I do get the flat style notification bar with other applications. Oh well,  these two are the big reasons as to why I will be passing on this application for now.  :)",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It worked great for 4 days, I bought the paid version and mms stopped working. Emailed the devs and never heard anything back. Emailed them after 2 days and still nothing! App has potential but customer support is awful!!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like the material design and easy navigation. One problem that bothers me is that I can't easily send group messages because there is no batch selection of contacts on the recipients tab. I still need to select the contacts individually which takes more time. A little bit hassle on that group messsaging part, but other than that, it's really good. Hope that it will be fixed on the next update and if done so, I'll totally be loyal on this app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,please add more COLOR themes.  This app is a lot like textra...but it needs a BLACKLIST option. It would be perfect.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just wow. Fast, beautiful (so glad that both notification and the navigation bars can be tinted) and simply works and zero ads",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love how it lets you see how many  texts there are in each convo, looks fab as well",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"for some reason 2 things happen.  1st group messaging shows a picture of someone not in the group, 2nd when I back out of the app it still pops up the quick box and I have to back out of that too.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really love this new update. But there is a tiny issue. There is a 'x' mark above the '+' circle button. Is there any way to remove it? If it's a fault can you please fix it? Overall this app is really awesome.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Please add notification sounds to repeat at certain intervals please. Otherwise, this is a nearly perfect app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great messaging app, but it would be so much better if it had dual sim support",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It takes quite a while to send pictures,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Nice, great app! Pls add more feature like hiding a message and no bubble in a conversation list?..Tnx",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Excellent app all around.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,When you have a conversation with your textmate can it have two colors so it wont be so confusing? thanks!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,it lags every time i open it..pls fix it,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Well supported great app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Beautiful and feature rich, what more could you want?",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It actually performs well at the moment like the theming. The fact you have a lot of access to the settings. However great missing features is attachments of video, able to send voice recording, sending text at a later time, taking a current photo or video and quickly attaching it, gifs, and quickly sharing a friend contact info with another. If this is available it will be a five star. Performance wise is great",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Tried it for a few hours and I like it alot ,I even purchase the plus version  just to show love.I'd like to see the option to change text tones to certain people or even set  notification lights to different individuals. Other than that this this a keeper for me.great job guys",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app closes down on me at least 3x an hour... I'll be in the middle of texting a message & it'll just say ""unfortunately qksms stopped"". Also, please look into MMS... I have to redownload the app almost any other time i use a theme coz it wont allow me to send an mms. Additionally, i love the sms settings especially the message count. Thanks :)",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Most of the time that I fully go into the app, it would show me a different thread of messages from someone else under a different contact's name. Which makes me wrong send often; and the only temporary fix I have for it is to go out to the contact list, select someone else and then go out again and go back into the thread I actually want to read to be able to see the proper thread of messages under the correct contact.  Edit: also ever since the new update it's been crashing constantly on my Samsung GS6",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Lots of force closing problems. I mean lots, it force closes at least four to five times a day. Most of the time it doesn't notify me right away. Please fix and I will rate five stars. I am using an LG Optimus L90",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've had QKSMS since the beginning,  and it has come a long way.  I've seen every single thing I've suggested be implemented in the next update or two.  Great developer.  But I have been experiencing a really annoying bug.  My message will get stuck on ""sending.."" for seemingly no reason,  and not give me any notification telling me that my message didn't send.  There is also no option to retry sending a message if it fails. It's been happening to me once about every 20 messages sent,  super annoying.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Since newest update it keeps crashing on me if this isn't fixed I'll be forced to uninstall and I love the app,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have yet to find anything that I really don't like about this app, except how you can't match the app font with your system font. I love the customization, especially how the icon matches your theme. :) the sliding panel is actually pretty awesome too. You have to give yourself time to get used to it, but it's a great feature. :) I would suggest adding different notification icons, like with custom colors...especially for per contact settings. But that's all! Great job.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'm excited they've made an option to mark messages as unread 🙌 The  developers are dedicated to fixing problems with regular updates, for instance they've made at least 4 updates in the last 3 weeks fixing problems related to user feedback. MMS auto configures &  works perfectly, pop-up is reliable. my only prob is I have a rare,  vivo Xshot &  search function is crashing",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"UI, usability is slick. Love it. However lots if instances where it crashes. There was one non crash bug where ur current conversation/other ones went blank. Hopefully it logs bugs extensively, and maybe it can add a report bug feature? It got a lot less buggy than it was a few months ago but its still the only gripe you can have with this great app. Great work guys!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Omg there are more customization option then textra. However, it's not as smooth and fluid as textra.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My screen doesn't come on when I receive a message and the LED won't flash. I've never had that problem on other SMS apps,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I wish there was an erase all messages. I like the default messaging for that feature but can't seem to find it here.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's fantastic, but the one thing that is keeping me from switching is the ability to lock messages. That would be an awesome addition to a wonderful app",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like this app a lot as a replacement for the HTC stock messaging app. My only complaint is that it's a little slow;there's definitely some wait time when you open the app or the quick reply. Otherwise, no complaints!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"locked my screen to test if my screen will turn on if i received a new message , i already enabled the ""turn your screen on when receiving new message"" but it does not work 😥..",3

Cheers, - Ken",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Things missing: ""Add to Contacts"" button. Evolve also had a nice feature that allowed me to swipe between conversations. If I had those two things QKSMS would be the perfect SMS app. I just realized I can't save MMS pictures, I can only ""Set As"" :/ looks like I'll be going back to a different app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"As most of the reviews say,  it's a great app but just needs more features.  I've found that while in the app,  any texts I receive are not shown as notifications.  This is annoying as I may not notice someone texted me until way after they do.  Also,  per contact notifications would be great,  and the ability to set custom vibrating patterns. Overall though I'm impressed,  good work guys",3

I was using it for a couple of months but it seems that I wasn't receiving a text message once every while.

I liked QK a lot, I wouldn't have changed it otherwise.  Best regards.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When I saw the /r/android post when this app was in alpha, I knew I wanted it. The app was great at the time, but there were many bugs. Fast forward to now and it has come a long way, but the bugs still don't allow me to use it full time.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great looking, does all I need, but crashes a lot. It could be my fault for some reason as I see not a lot of other reviewers have this problem, but literally more than 50% of my messages i get an ""unfortunately, qksms has stopped"". It does always send the message though.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Needs the ability to batch delete messages, rather than long pressing to delete a message you should be able to click multiple messages to delete them all at once. In addition I feel the quick reply pop up needs to be given the option to only pop up when you hit ""reply"" from your notifications. This is because it is quite annoying watching a video, playing a game or reading something and the pop up reply window blocks everything. Please consider this change. Thank you !",3

It has everything I'm looking for, the only problem I've run across thus far is that the app won't let me delete photo messages but it will let me delete text messages.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I wish I wouldn't have paid for plus, but my only real complaint is that the attachment button is in the same spot as the send button so I accidentally pull up my photos nearly every time I go to send texts. It's pretty annoying. Other than that I like it, it's smooth and easy on the eyes.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very polished app. Beautiful to use. Had some problems with getting MMS crashing app but figured it out. I use a direct text widget and there is a quick lag before the pop up shows. Other than that, perfect. Keep up the great work!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is one of the best texting apps in my opinion, except for one thing.. I wish that we would be able to use our font packs like we can on the pre installed messaging app. If this changes, I'll give 5 stars!!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Ability to customize individual color bubbles and notification colors for contacts would be huge. Makes a big difference!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"There are still bugs to iron out but in general, for daily use this is a great sms app. Very accessible developer too.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I payed for this and after paying and having it for about two weeks it now will not let me knew when I have a text when my phone is asleep!!  What good is this app if you have to go check every little bit to see if anyone texted you. Have emailed them two times no one gets back to you. Don't not get or at lest do not pay for it!!!!!!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Excellent app. Would be nice if each individual text had its own time stamp instead of being grouped together in a future update but other than that the app is very polished. Great job,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,MMS files don't always show up. And some that are multiple pictures won't come up and sometimes can't get saved.  Now any MMS file is delayed and even some of the regular SMS messages.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Got pics an hour later. Goodbye..,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like the look and feel of this app, it does a good job following the Material design. One suggestion for a future feature: be able to view the person's phone number in the conversation that I'm messaging. Example: trying to text a coworker on his work phone number instead of his personal cell phone. Keep up the great work! EDIT 3/27/15 The notification LED feature is not working for me, hopefully this gets resolved! Thanks!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really great & super nice design but PLEASE add scheduled messaging!!! Would also love to be able to see the previous messages in the quick reply popup.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Trying to be a copy of evolvesms poor at that. Picture messages dont send,even after Vodafone tell me settings.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Unfortunately I am taking this away from default messaging for now. I'm having loads of trouble receiving mms where I'll suddenly get 5 at once or more and they're all time stamped to the time I got them so I have no idea when they actually are from. Also not getting notifications for unread messages which leads me to missing them for hours at a time.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is very fast, smooth and looks great. One issue I've noticed: the app doesn't save the context when switching from portrait to landscape - if I write a message and change the phone orientation before sending the message then it is discarded (lost) and I have to write it again.",5

I'm using Google Now launcher with xgels.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I've been using this since nearly the beginning. It's always been the best. Although there is one big issue that I would like to see fixed soon. It will never send messages through quick reply or quick compose.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Needs ability to attach multiple pics to one MMS message and have built in option of choosing between iPhone and Android emojis. Also have experienced problems when rotating my screen to landscape mode and the messages between the person and I just disappear,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like it. The only problem I have is that when the screen rotates, a popup comes up saying MMS has been successfully configured. This isn't really a problem since I have rotation disabled most of the time, but it's a bit annoying. Also there's no animation for when you send a text.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"App is great but every MMS pic is the same throughout all my threads, it's either the latest one I sent or the last one I received. Also, MMS doesn't work with tmobile WiFi calling, please fix this!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I've tried many messaging apps and this one is the best so far. No lag. Love the look,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's a very nice app but some features are not working properly especially in the notifications area. Wake up screen or vibrate is not working when receiving a new text.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,After seeing this app featured in an article online I figured I'd try it out and I'm not disappointed. The developer is very helpful as well.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Without a doubt, the best designed messaging app. Simple, and performs really well. However, this needs the option toggle automatic MMS downloading, like Hangouts has! Great work to all those involved:)",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love everything about it but it's missing one key element for me. Please add an option where you can select multiple conversations for deletion. Thanks.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I am missing signature capability.  Can that be added??  Other than that it's a great app.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the customization of this app. I love the solid-faded tinted status bar upon reaching the top. and I love the classy color. Just one thing, when i'm scrolling down the app gets laggy. and I wish there's an option when on the conversation list i can simply swipe from right to show a delete and call functionality.. Textra is the best reference. But still, stunning messaging app. richer option than others.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I enjoy the app and it works well. The themes are simple, but excellent. Also, the pop-up texts are well integrated. I do, however, have an issue with my notifications disappearing immediately if I lock my phone with the app open. Also, (and this is a minor thing) I would like the option to select and delete multiple texts/conversations at once.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just like pretty much every texting app, this has some major MMS issues. On this app it's really weird, I'll get the MMS and have it but can't view it. I have to go to my stock messaging app to see the picture. Please fix, extremely annoying. Other than that, this is my new main messaging app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Overall I'm very impressed with this app and despite it resembling Textra SMS, it's very nice!  It's much faster and more responsive than Textra and that's what I was looking for! - A few features that should be implemented to make this application perfect. 1. Message delay, for when you goof up a message and want a timer before it's sent so you can't cancel it. 2. Dong automatically make quick reply open. Open quick reply when you press on notification.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I only have 2 complaints 1) messages aren't being marked as read, even when I have the message open in the app, since the latest update. 2) Maybe I'm missing it but an in app bug report would be nice so I don't have to discourage people from your app for nit picking.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Between this and google messenger, this has better mechanics and a better ui. Unfortunately, bugs and crashes ruined this app for me.  Stock messages loads faster and doesn't freezer as much. Seriously, it takes me two whole minutes to get through one text because midway of writing, it freezes!! Then after I send it boom a second freeze,  I hope it's fixed one day but installing it from my m7",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Please have a plugin for iOS emoji. Also, every time I send a message via quick compose, it makes a new thread even though there is already an old one. Please fix asap because I really wanna co to us using this is default",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This is by far one of the best sms app. It only lacks one thing- dual sim capabilities,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great but i hate when i write something and rotate phone in landscape mode it doesnot save what i wrote :(,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the pop up messaging and notifications but MMS only works some of the time on my Lollipop Moto X. Really frustrating to never know if the receiver will get my pictures.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"One of the best messaging apps I've ever used. Fast, clean and simple. Other than minor functionality and aesthetic upgrades to give it a lollipop feel the way textra and google messenger look... Overall it's amazing",5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have finally begun using this as my main SMS app! I am looking forward to more updates in the future. If a blacklist option was added, this app would take the cake in all departments!",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Buggy, very buggy. Says I have 19 unread messages when I have 0 unread. Will permanently place a pop up notification if I get a picture message and will keep it till I reply. During this time hitting the notification will not take me to the message. Uninstalling for textra atm. I want to like this app since you're a solo dev who posts to people on reddit. Just fix the issues!",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The material design is beautiful in this app. Also has a pretty good amount of settings to change the design and functionality some However I can not receive ANY texts while on T-mobile with wifi calling turned on. I can Never receive MMS on or off wifi. That's unacceptable!,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like the look and layout (honestly the same basis as textra but I dislike the more centered FAB) my biggest complaint would be that this app doesn't support mms over WiFi ss a setting option, and that's the biggest reason I haven't been able to leave textra.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like the pop ups and how fast it is to open the full conversion easy and smoothly. Could use a more android l material design but it constantly crashes.

Hoping for a fix as soon as possible. I also just requested to join the Google+ page so ill be posting this on there once I've been accepted",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Its awsm app but some bugs irritate when i send message from quick reply the message is in sending condition not send. Suggestion is it not show the message came on sim1 or sim2 and it has no option to select either i wanna sent msg from sim1 or sim2 at run time please and add multi select conversations and message to delete at once please add these features :-(,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Design - well designed.   Functional - encountering many bugs. Notifications can't wake the device, quick reply doesn't pop over the lock screen, which means its not that quick at all.  Overall: 2/5, will change review when fixed",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Looks a lot like Google messenger and that isn't a bad thing. Lots of options and very quick. UI is slick. Would give it 5 stars if we could send more than pictures. Pop up notification isn't always reliable,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Pros: Love the customization, love love love the pop up notification and ability to respond on the pop up. Love the night time mode I keep it on even in the day and it helps my LG GFlex save battery. Love the whole style and look of the app. Cons: why can't I send picture msg? I can receive though. Other than that I love it and would pay for it if I could send pics.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really love this app! I've loved it since I've started using it. I am a QKSMS+ user. However, one major issue for me. MMS messaging... I group message with a group of friends constantly. And for some reason, I don't get notified for ANY MMS messages. So I never know when they're texting back in the group message or when I'm receiving a picture message. And on top of that, it CONSTANTLY refreshes the messages when I am in the app looking at the group messages. It's really irritating. I know the developer hates them, but I will be switching to Textra to test them out until this is fixed... :/",3

Thankd for an amazing app",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,1) Needs option to open a camera from the attachment button to quickly snap and send a photo. 2) User should be able to turn off the vibration and/or toast that initiate from delivery reports. 3) Colored text bubbles need to have dark text when the current theme color is very bright/light. 4) Being able to swipe to the left on any conversation to slide it into view would feel very nice and consistent with the swipe-to-left gesture that takes you back to the conversation list.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It is super great, with colorful chats and popups...but the app is laggy for 30 seconds when i open her...jut fix that please and it will be the best! :D",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Its beautiful and easy but it would be more better if it has emoji option and quick text.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It will be great if can save unsent messages in drafts.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Is it possible for you to add a feature which hides private messages like the stock MIUI SMS app? If yes I'll surely buy it! :))) Thanks for this beautiful app ;),5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Sometimes doesn't show recent conversation in window. Otherwise, awesome app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Conversations don't disappear anymore so it's great now!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Application is cool but it only allow first sim to send there is no option for 2nd sim plz devolved it,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Yes,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"works and looks the best out of everyone I have tried only problem is all the sudden my status bar isn't tinted to the same color.  HTC 510 android 4.4.2 * edit: 5 stars last update fixed my status bar issue.,best app by far. Thanks",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It won't even let me open the app. It will show the app for a second and then it will crash. I tried reinstalling it and still have the same problem.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"To start, I absolutely love this app, great work! First time I've been able to stick with an SMS app without switching back and forth! Just one suggestion to improve my experience and make it 100% perfect, can you make it so that the bubble length can be changed? So that it doesn't have to go all the way to the other side of the screen?",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,You still can't save photos you receive and photo thumbnail is incorrect. Two months and it still has so many bugs. Go with Textra.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The app is awesome. I would love it so much more tho if I could interact with it more on my android wear device. Just a small thing tho.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Now that full Wear support is here, QKSMS is the only sms app I use. It's fantastic.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just the one I've been looking for. Light weight, without ads or bunches of add on",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I thought textra was great. Then I found this. Literally the best I've ever used.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Excellent messaging application I have ever used! Impressed!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Please make it to where we can use our own font,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great Look,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"but doesn't handle group messages at all. Force quits every time I try to open one. When it does accomplish them, the avatar associated with the conversation is of a random contact not at all involved in the conversation. I have yet to find a 3rd party app that successfully handles group messages. That includes Google Hangouts.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I don't get notifications for group messages; I've double checked all my settings, and everything seems to be in order so I don't know what's wrong. Also, sometimes I get a quick reply screen that says ""zero messages"" after I've sent a quick reply. Otherwise aesthetically pleasing app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,LOVE this texting app. Beautiful and awesome! The only thing that bothers me is that I don't seem to get any notification(s) when I receive a picture message (MMS). Notifications work fine for SMS though.. I just don't get any at all when receiving MMS.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"A great balance between form and function. Does everything I'd want an SMS app to do, without being swamped in excessive ""features"" and options, while still looking darn good.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Would be awesome if you could add an option ""Vibrate only when in vibrate mode"" so that the phone would only vibrate when it's on vibrate and not when the ringer is on.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Far too often, when using the quick reply feature, it wouldn't send my responding text to the person I am speaking with. Unacceptable for a messaging app.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,it stinks wouldnt let me receive a picture that was sent last nite N i couldnt send 1 it kept freezin,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Works as advertised...,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App started to get a little choppy and pop up text notifications would display wrong names at times.. This would confuse me as to who I was actually texting. Also brand new text messages sometimes would not show up until I refreshed thread by going to another thread and then back.. Annoying... Textra is better,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I paid for QKSMS+ back in July of 2014 and have been patiently waiting for all the bugs to be ironed out. I just reinstalled QK to check on the progress and have already noticed a number of bugs that are still present. MMS is still broken, popup reply is hit/miss, all sent/received pictures display the same image, etc...",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is slick and beautiful. One issue however is the ""failed text messages"". I have a handful of text messages buried in conversations that failed to send and there is no presumable way to access them and delete or even remove the indicator. The indicator is the same colour and in the same location as the "" new message"" indicator and I just wish I could remove them! If I wanted to it would be hours of sifting up through conversations that have been ongoing for ages. Please help!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Started using this out of curiosity. Very attractive. However, this app is terrible in every aspect when it comes to group chats and the notification system. You'll see. Force quit more than expected but that can be fixed. And when you use the search and click on a message result, it doesn't take you to that message. As much as I wanted to live this beautifully designed app. It pushed me away with all these bugs and flaws that forced me back to Textra..",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The messenger is slick,  works almost all the time. But i need to report a bug. I have G3 D855 on kitkat 4.4.2 and the app crashes when i try to open and text to someone from the contacts. Plx fix this.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I don't get why its keeps saying APN not set when I open to read messages. Its a glitch in something that's so good. Please rectify it,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I'm using paranoid android with immersive mode enabled (my nav bar is pie control so for the most part hidden unless needed). This app seems to keep the space for the nav bar beneath everything... Leaving a big black strip across the bottom...,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app but when I receive picture messages. It doesn't tell me, I have to go into the app and see somebody sent me one. Please fix",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,One of the better SMS apps I've used. Tons of features and really like how smooth the transition between conversation list and open thread is. Will definitely use as my SMS app after most bugs are fixed and more features like customizable bubble colors are added,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love it but not letting me text from contacts any more,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Nice visuals, good customization options. Overall one of the best sms apps",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The app FC's when you try to text someone from the phone app. Using nexus 5 on android lollipop.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Transitions are great! UI is super friendly, and I like this BETTER than Textra. But did I pay $1.99 to only get automatic night mode? That was kind of surprising...",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Excellent work. Would be nice to integrate VoIP.ms SMS for those of us who have switched over to SIP. Thanks!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Performance is not smooth, no support for android wear.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Easily better than the stock text app.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Any chance to allow use of system fonts?,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app looks nice and functions well but it's missing some features that I use with Chomp SMS. I don't see a way to delete all conversations at once, it seems like you need to delete each one individually which is annoying and I like that you can set chomp to automatically pop up the keyboard when you open conversion, saves extra clicks.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, I love the customization available (status bar tint, contact image display) but the only thing that is a little irritating is how messages are shown a little bit on the right side rather than a whole home screen dedicated to all your messages. Other than that, this is great!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's a great and smooth work but kindly update these features.  1. Pop up window has no close button and it's setting menu. 2. Side bar should be less visible. 3. Individual color selection is not available within the conversation.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great apps. Absolutely gorgeous an  so glad you guys fixed the lag when switching convos. However, after using smitten SMS I love the ability to see the whole convo in the reply pop up.  Add this and it will be the best sms app ever and I will switch over! Great work an will keep installed in hopes of adding this.  Update: Thanks QKSMS!!! perfect.  Anyway to make the default and have that always pop up with whole convo? you guys are awesome.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is by far the best SMS experience I've ever had, great job developers for creating a wonderful app, even better that the famous Textra and Google Messenger. One thing to add is the option to just have transparent navigation bars, so the background on the nav bars match your background. 👌👌👌👌",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is the answer to all. Works as advertised. It's fast, smooth, responsive and most of all it's interface looks amazing. Coupled with the free customization options, I'm never going to look for any other. Keep it simple QKSMS! :) Edit: one star missing for slow response when replying in popup notification. Other than that it's awesome.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The plan texting is great. When receiving pictures, it acts kinda weird and doesn't take the whole screen when you tap on the picture. It goes to a smaller viewer. There is no mass delete option and no option to lock messages. No option to download pictures. Can't recieve MMS messages.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When I open the app, a notification appears in in the notification screen that, depending on the conversation I was previously in, displays either an empty message from nobody or my previous message. Also, texts haven't been delivering to any iOS phones recently. Like the app otherwise, hate the bugs.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's simple and has a great color scheme that I love!. The mark as read option in the pull down menu is awesome! It's fast too! I like the pop up message up option, nothing new, but very efficient. However I've recently gone back to my old messenger because sometimes I click on a thread and it is blank, and I get random quit unexpectedly messages. Not a huge problem but I use my phone for work and need to be extremely efficient. Trying it again though!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Installed after seeing it on /r/android and loved it initially. Having MMS issues, though. Whenever I try to send a picture it adds a second 'person' to the list that is just a 3 number chain and then doesn't send. Also issues with contact pictures displaying wrong in group chats. Keeping it updated as I watch for these fixes but not using it as my texting app yet.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the app and its material touches and such. Just a small suggestion. Could you allow for multiple selection of conversations? Because I tend to go on a deleting spree like a lot of people I know and being able to select multiple conversations and delete them with just one click is almost a necessity with my messaging apps. Having to delete them individually and confirm deletion is kind of a drag. Also there happens to be a few bugs left when it comes to sending new messages,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,good but some of my contacts names won't be displayed in the conversation.. Only the phone number appears.. please fix it.. And is there any possibility you can make  a way for us to reply from the notification bar itself?,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"But I have a message that won't go away no matter how many times I check it , I get a notification for it please fix or help me",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I keep getting an error that the APN settings can't be found and won't load. I use MMS all the time for group messaging so this is a real issue. Even when manually entering my carriers apn settings it doesn't n't work,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is borderline unusable. Sends quick replies to wrong recipients, displays blank conversation windows, sometimes you can see a new message on notification bar but not in the conversation window, problems with auto night-mode switching (black text on dark window), no multi-select, sometimes can't copy texts without any apparent reason, etc. Never should have gotten out of alpha testing. App is updated less frequently since and dev(s) don't even address the problems in updates. The ones that were supposed to be ""fixed"" are not really fixed, they just occur less frequently.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Only thing I wish to see added is the ability to use my specialized tones I have set for my contacts. It would be much appreciated if this were added.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This is by far the best and original material design sms app and its great to use. Looking forward for more features..,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Application is not notifying me of any new MMS, they show up unread in the messages list but I don't get a notification for it. Otherwise one of the best messaging apps I've tried",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"A really beautiful app, the only thing preventing me using it over Google's Messenger is the lack of an Archiving feature, and there are still tiny gremlins here and there, such as the wrong contact icons across multiple conversations!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is the best sms app and definitely a keeper... But there's one bug I just found out about. I'm on an xperia L non rooted and stock, and whenever I open this app and it is not in the ram memory, mobile data gets enabled and then disabled... It's kind of annoying and I guess it will ruin my battery life... Please fix it guys it's so awesome",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I used to manage sms with textra for a long time but switched to qksms at the first time I tried. Really good app with useful functions.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Stunning UI,  love the tinted bars. 5 stars and I will buy QKSMS+ if u can add blacklist and batch delete options",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Everytime I open the app a window pops up saying that it needs to set the apns and when I click okay it says it failed and I have to go under MMS setting and do it. How do I do that? I really hope you can help because I love this app.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been using this for the last month after getting sick of Hangouts, but had to uninstall after constant crashes and empty messages. Shame because I love the design.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Looks elegant, clean, and works like a charm. One feature that I would like to request would be the ability to change the incoming text bubble color. Cheers and keep up the good work.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I emailed the developer an about a graphical issue and run In's. And after a one on one discussion everything is great.  By far the most excellent support. Which will lead to a excellent app to come.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really want to like this app, but there are lots of bugs.  I'm working on the galaxy note 4.  I am unable to send or receive MMS while in WI-FI. The quick text box pops up with the previous texts instead of the incoming, and the sync between the full window and the quick window with most recent message in a feed does not keep up.   I paid for this app and I'm uninstalling. But I LOVE the simplicity and the UI. Keep working on it!!",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I can customize it and its easyy! I also have quick reply which I like and I can make everything pink! ❤❤❤ PLUS it doesnt take up much battery or make my phone hot 🙌,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love the app but I wish I had an option to have date and timestamps on every message and the ability to lock messages. Hopefully an update can fix that.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Incorrect unread count in notification, contact names not showing in notification occasionally, mms not giving notification.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love this app, but the titular error makes it unusable for me. I'll be using Messenger until this is fixed. Also, I would like iOS emojis - the ability to choose, like Textra, would be nice.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very easy to use and addicting. This app has made texting fun again for me but the errors of not being able to set my APN bugs me. I was able to send messages for a while but now I cannot . I would like to be able to replace my stock messaging app with this app but the errors doesn't allow me. I am running on andriod 4.2 and a Samsung s3 on virgin mobile does anyone else have this problem ?,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Favorite messaging app but there are some bugs with mms still and on 5.0 notifications and quick reply sort of clash,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Recent update made this exactly into what I feel it should be. Seamless step in the right direction; can't wait to see whatever else awaits!,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the fluidity and simplicity but when receiving group texts, the notification at the top will not go away, if I swipe it away it just returns, and if I check ""read"" it does nothing. If I click the message the app opens a blank conversation with no one. Only way to make it go away is to open the app and find and enter that group conversation. Great app other than this but if it persists I can't use it on a daily basis its too frustrating",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a great app, and I would certainly give it the maximum amount of stars if it didn't struggle with working properly with android wear. I made this my default SMS app on my Nexus 4, but it did not often push text messages through to my LG G watch, causing me to miss out on important and timely messages. Additionally, when I would get an sms sent my LG G watch, it wouldn't say from whom but display their mobile number only. Until these issues are corrected, I will hold off on purchasing the full app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"First and foremost the app is gorgeous. But has extreme issues. In my opinion it should still be in beta. Notifications barely work not making any sounds while music or any other special is playing, won't turn on my screen even though I have it checked, fails to state who is texting despite the number being saved, doesn't inform me of MMS, messages, and keeps saying message failed to download in group chats. I really want to love this app but beauty is only skin deep.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a great app, but it does have some UI issues. I pretty regularly see it  get confused & show the wrong contact-photo/avatar for people in conversations. A restart of the app always seems to fix it, at least for a while.  It also seems to happen more often in the summary window when multiple people are involved (shows the avatar of someone not in the conversation).",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Beautiful but glitchy. On my s4 running CM11, it often fails to show last text message in texting conversation, have to go to list of texts to see it. Also if I get a photo from someone not in my contacts, I have a ""Hidden Sender"" error message in my notification bar that only goes away if app is reinstalled. Wish these things were fixed. It's a lovely app otherwise",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Perfect except for this one thing, and I need it to stay up to date with my friends. Maybe I'm missing something though",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Can we disable quick reply for certain apps? With Snapchat I have to hold to view pictures/videos but when a text comes (via quick reply) it forces me out of viewing that picture/video.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just add Archive option, everything else is just great",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Lag when selecting conversation now fixed. Disappearing conversation when rotating phone now fixed. This app is back to being the best.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Constantly turns portrait photos to landscape when sending.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Can we be allowed to take pics and send them already? Also implementing a setting to turn on data when we send a MMS and then to revert it to the state it was at would be great. 8sms has this and so does many other AOSP clients.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love the app but the only problem is it always messes up the group MMS avatar. Also whenever I rotate yo landscape it jumps to a blank message with no recipient.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Woohoo !!! Love the tinted status bar n navigation bar concept!! It makes u feel totally deep into texting!! Better than textra i should admit animation wise,quick action,really user friendly !!! Haven't  tried all functionalities yet.Love at first sight ;) Great job !!!  Loving it !!!",5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Buggy,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very good looking sms app. Simple and clean but the settings section is so confusing, I can't be able to toggle them the way I want. I had to go back to the list to see my changes. My suggestion is to make setting more user friendly like add buttons in front of options. And it connects to mobile data even when I had it turned off. And if you can please add SMS counter. No other sms app has one that can count them correctly.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I find it really lags when i open the app or select a new conversation. I am typically looking at 2-5 seconds for the app to load and when selecting different conversation threads. Also pleae allow me to open the camera in the app to take pictures and send them via MMS. Otherwise beautiful app with buttery smooth animations.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I've found a bug and have tried to contact the devs to find the email address doesn't exist (according to google) I've paid money and think I deserve a way of talking to the devs. I know this is open source software does that mean no one takes responsibility for the app.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like this app, true black for amoled is a very nice touch. I am however seeing a bug where an sms thread can be empty if my phone is locked when I receive a message and the app was open when I had locked my phone. If I back out of the app and go back into it the thread will be populated again. Let me know if you want me to pull a log cat or anything, I'm running 4.4.4 on a moto x 2nd gen.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Using it on the note 4 and occasionally I will get a blank thread and then the whole app crashes, once it comes back it works fine again. Would like more color variations on the chat bubbles etc. even if that's just open to paid folks.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I overall liked the app, but not being able to choose which people to add to your group messaging and having to type each name in kind of frustrates me. If you can make this possible pls add it. It'd be a lot easier to group message",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When I open the app I get a blank thread in place of my previous conversation, and the only solution is killing and reopening the app. Also for some reason there's 2 quick replies that pop up for it, really stumped on that one. Textra has been working great on Lollipop.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Looks and feels great BUT it doesn't import all contact names and images. So I have a conversation list filled with phone numbers and I have no idea whom they belong too. Touching the # circle next to the number shows the correct contact card with name and image, though. Using xperia z3c.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I often get messages with only phone numbers in the notification. Sharing a photo from the gallery, the contact is entered with the area code as a separate string of text, which creates a new messaging thread separate from the thread for the actual contact. When you first open a messaging thread avatars will sometime not load or will be wrong. Program doesnt reflect contact updates. Not getting notifications for group MMS replies. Visible refresh loading a conversation. Can't turn off analytics.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really awesome sms app just needs some more polish. My LED notifications don't work and it'd be nice if it came with more vibration options among other things but I'll definitely keep using this regularly to see where it goes,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Group messaging takes forever to receive and when it does come it either shows the text and then disappear, failed to even download, or I get them in the wrong order/receive them twice. Contact photo sometimes shows on the wrong contact. Quick reply shows a previous text versus the text that just came in. Maybe include a feature where there is no pop-up when watching a video. There are more bugs but right now, these are my biggest ones. Layout and design is my favorite out of all the text apps. Please fix!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Add batch delete to conversation/messages lists please! Also is there a way to hide timestamps? I'd prefer my message view to look a little less cluttered. Also whenever I receive multiple images over mms it appears as a video, please fix this! Great app, purchased the premium version, I'd just like a few more features to make it perfect!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app worked very well for me for a few days, but I have gotten a bug where a notification keeps popping up even after I have dismissed it. It reads 0 New messages and it indicates that it's from me. If this bug disappears I will use this again.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app and can't wait to see it evolve and improve. Just a few things. I wish MMS or picture messages should be handled like other SMS apps where you can swipe through previous picture messages from the same contact rather than it opening separately.   Having a bug where looking at a conversation and rotating will wipe the screen and change the to ""compose message"" rotating the screen back does nothing to remedy it. Kind of annoying. I love the app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I used textra before this and while it is similar, qksms is better. I love the changes I can make to the appearance. There are some bugs that keep me from loving it though. When I open it from my home screen, it often opens to a blank page and I have to swipe left to see my messages. The quick reply feature is wonderful, however I don't like that I have to mark as read to get the notification to go away...I already read it. I would like to be able to integrate personalized tones for different contacts.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Awesome app overall, it'd be even better if you could toggle which side the swipe to your past page was on. Also not having the popup for a new text display over the same conversations active window would be sweet!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"the app is great and i would love to keep using it, tho i would like to see more color varieties in customization. my biggest gripes however are the blank pages created during screen rotations and the fact that there seems to be perhaps a glitch? according to my battery page qksms has kept my phone awake for over 17hrs, which doesnt make sense at all. tho its a relatively recent occurence its run my battery down and i may switch back to textra for the time being.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Functions not working like message forwarding.  Some times u get option to forward sometimes u don't.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great feel but buggy, lags and crashes on the Note 4. Really want to make it my daily driver but it's not ready for prime time yet.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like the new features like the pop up box, night mode and appearance customization. Missing some basics though like message forwarding and the ability to attach more than just pics. Rating goes up if this gets fleshed out.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love how the app looks,  but I would love the ability to mark multiple threads for deletion, or archiving or merging. One more thing: the options to add an unknown number to my contact list.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"...because I'm an active redditor and the dev hangs out in the android sub, so I like supporting fellow redditors, but it's way too buggy for me to keep using. I'm going to send an email outlining everything I've experienced because I don't have enough room here, but bottom line is I can't rely on the app to show my incoming messages, so it's a no-go. I can't be missing important texts because they disappear after the pop-up goes away!! (Note 4 user here...)",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app has a good ui, and looks good, but still has issues, few are : opening app on Lollipop sometimes never opens conversations and on the Android wear watch reply never works",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Could be one of the best messaging  apps, but for now you can't have a personalized notification sound or color per contact.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I don't know if this is on the devs part or my galaxy s5 but when I go to download the new update it only goes to 26% it just stops and won't download,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Amazing app but I only used it for an hour or so and it crashed 3-4 times and pulled up some conversations blank and wouldn't let me read new messages at all.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great texting app, beautiful looks, delivery reports which are missing from so many others. Love the pop up window",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Beautiful, fast and supports unicode stripping. The additional features like popup messages are a nice touch on top. I highly recommend this app to everyone.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Multi select, one tap copy of phone numbers, bubble color customization, colored emojis, one tap resend button and ability to search contacts on the searcher",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been with you sense the early alpha when I first saw a post about this on reddit. I fell in love with this app and I still do love it, but recently I've switched from my Galaxy S3 to a LG G3 and I'm noticing a bit of a lag. Maybe you could fix that? But like I said I love the app keep it up! This is my first problem ever with the app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is better than any of the other messaging apps I've tried,  there are a few minor things that from what I have heard are on their way to being fixed, other than that I love it!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I didn't rate 5 stars because when I turn my phone to landscape mode the messages disappear. Then I have to go back out and back in to the message.it gets annoying and I wish you could fix it.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Same here:  ""Crashes as soon as icon is clicked on note 3""",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love this app and have tried it since beta. MMS has always been a slight issue but not a big one as I don't picture message much. I get MMS but not the notification. Also crashes when opening images,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App is near perfect. Love the smoothness. If only you can still select a picture after typing your message and have support for gifs like hangouts and iMessage does then it would be perfect. Keep up the good work!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My only complaint is that I have to delete the messages one by one. I can't select the conversations that I want to delete and those I want to keep,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Buggy. Phone numbers with no names in notifications. When I open a notification text it brings me to new message screen,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a very good app, but it needs more transitions. Like when you get a message have it slide in instead of appear out of nowhere, and same goes for sending a message have it transition from where you right it to where it is sent.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Loving it so far. Just one thing I can't find an answer to. Does this app allow for separate notification tones per contact? This is an awesome feature I would love to be implemented!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Lots of inactive settings, some are active but you don't know if they are enabled or not... Very strange",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Beautiful material design and customizable. Unfortunately its a little buggy which can get really annoying.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"But could use some of Textras features such as ability to select multiple conversations, changing individual bubble colors and toggles for notification duration and ability to open quick reply from the drop down rather than have both appear.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It kills the battery BC it randomly turns on data and WiFi and other things,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Too many bugs, had to go to Textra. I'll be back once things are fixed.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Like the little details more than the other apps out (like Google Messenger and textra),5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Crashes constantly, missing features (like saving pictures from SMS), apparent attempt to support landscape that doesn't actually work... It's still good, but why use it if Textra will be more stable?",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I have a concern on your app but I can't send an E-mail. Do you have another E-mail address? I really don't want to rate your app 4 stars. I hope you'll put the feature where we can scan our fonts and choose our own font style. If you this, I'll change my rating to 5 stars. Hope you'll do some action on this and I'll wait for an update. Thank you very much!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Works very well, it is graphically pleasing and works from the status bar.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app! In first usage! But could you add option for multi selection, so we don't have to delete messages one by one. It seems to me it can't.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Been using it since alpha and it has come a long way. Thanks Dev! Needs work with MMS though,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Awesome but whenever the app accidentally goes into landscape orientation and then back to portrait, it switches to only a picture of my bathroom sink that I do not remember taking",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Hey great, simple and sweet. Landscape doesn't always work the way intended. Please fix, I will give 5 stars if you do!!!!",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very good app. I like it for the quick reply pop up,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this application, but little buggy when opening a messages . Please fix it thanks.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I loved this! I got the full version free so no problem 👌,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Crashes as soon as icon is clicked on note 3,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,At last this is official release. Love the ui.maybe a bit better than textra.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The material design implementation is even better than official M.D. Google Apps! Nice work,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Using this on nexus 5 lollipop instead of hangouts, I like it",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Will be 5 stars when I can use iOS emojis!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Blacklist feature would be great. App is superb. Still catching up.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,A little more work and its perfect!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Basically combined google messenger and textra. Love it.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love it so much :*,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Good UI but with lots of bugs,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"No MultiSIM, nonfunctional ASCII",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's beautiful... I love bright colors,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Crashes when I need it!!!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Why dose it keep crashing?!?! Plz fix problem.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love it,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Excellent txt app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Best SMS app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Wonderful,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's beautiful. No 3rd-party app follows Material Design more closely than this one. Expect some weird bugs and missing features. Although this won't make you lose any message, I'm afraid it's probably enough to make you remove this app from your device.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really want to make this my default SMS app. The only thing holding me back switching from Textra is the lack of iOS emoji support. A lot of my friends have iPhones and it's often hard to figure out what an Android emoji will translate to on iOS.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So amazed by this app. I don't mind MMS because I don't use it. I love the aesthetics so much, so much material. Might I suggest changing the chat bubbles to the one Google Messenger has for a full material feel. Or at least make it as an option. Also scrolling is a bit laggy but good enough. Keep it up guys",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"One big thing it is missing for me is texting to a predefined group already set up within Android contacts. Not exactly uncommon, Google's own SMS app skipped adding that. Still, a big feature for me in an ever day SMS app. Hope to see it soon. Otherwise, great look and it actually does feel different then Textra to me. Possible every day app down the road.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is great and IMO feels better to use than any of the alternatives. However the thing that stops me from making this my default SMS app: no option to display  full names in group chats, no option to hide ""no subject"" line from group texts, and its be nice to have the call button in group texts list the ppl in the chat and their phone numbers instead of calling a odd 6 digit number. These things are present in Textra and I find them quite helpful.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'm using this one the phone in the title and I want to love this app. I really do. The developer is responsive and it looks beautiful, but I have never seen an app completely lock up my entire phone. It wouldn't turn off and the screen was on, and I had to go to work. It routinely locks up the keyboard, crashes all the time, and stutters more than my car. I will happily change this to 5 if it gets fixed.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very fast and nice messaging app. One consistent problem so far is that the incoming message notification in the drop down notification bar does not always show the name of who the incoming message is from, nearly half the time it shows only the phone number. Will continue to use the app as it is fast and responsive, looking forward to a fix on this minor issue tho. This occurs on Android 5.0",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"MMS still has issues all over the place (oftentimes doesn't send, doesn't notify me when I get a new MMS, contact pictures all screwed up). Quick reply is broken. Automatic night mode doesn't work right and screws up the font colors.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Unable to fwd sms.  Long press on a message doesnt give any option like fed or delete.  Please fix this urgently.  Very annoying and stupid bug,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Had this since alpha, MMS still doesn't work, notifications didn't pop up. Bought QKSMS+ to support but this is still not a daily driver. Bunch of unfulfilled promises and awful support from the developers.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But its an overall great app. Absolutely needs the ability to see who's involved in a group text as well as ability to save MMS.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Super pretty and potentially awesome but as it stands now just a little bit too glitchy. Saving a draft saves it forever, messages appear in pop ups that don't appear in the conversation itself. A little more time in the oven and I'll give it another shot.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like the look and feel of this app, but I would love to see the ability to set individual notification settings. Being able to know who's texting me before I grab my phone would be very handy.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The default hangouts sms app allows you to reply to texts from the moto 360.  This app does not.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But the resolution is strange. I'm hiding the navigation and status bar but the app ignores that and displays an empty bar on the top and another one on the bottom. That alone makes me not want to use it.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I think it would be better if, once you select a contact when composing a new message, the old messages get pulled up. Second minor thing is to have the keyboard automatically pop up after hitting search.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app but I'm having issues setting it as my default texting messenger. Smooth and good looking otherwise,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Unconvenient that I can't swipe left from all threads anywhere on the screen to get back in to current thread. It's a bit of a pain having to swipe from the far right. Also being able to choose contact photos from Facebook is what would make me choose this app over hellosms.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"need to be able to delete more than one convo at a time, otherwise app seems solid",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like the customising options but it's still a little buggy. A few notables ones is when messages don't load when you open through pop up window. Also Messages don't fully load when you open from pop up, like just a few of the recent bubbles don't load",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Best messaging design but buggy, it constantly tries to open mobile data, contacts appear as numbers and sometimes a bit laggy.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Pretty great and definitely benefitted from user feedback. More options than most, easy to use, seems fast too. Looking forward to any new features that might come :)",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like how you made the ui look material like but could we get a little more animations/features on the main messages tabs.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love it. Only wish the pop-up box style was more like the floating chat heads on facebook's messenger. Otherwise everything is perfect. Very fast and fluent ui.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Group messages don't always come through. Pictures don't always come through. And we the users should be able to select and send grouped pics all from the app. Similar to Google's new messenger app.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"the best messaging replacement app I've seen. I'm running the latest HTC rom on my One M7, so the UI is already looking more material and similar to Lollipop, but might not get Lollipop until Feb 2015. So this app makes my messages match with the feel of the rest of my phone, and the customization is great for a free version of the app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Been following this app since it was alpha. I gladly donated. Awesome guy to boot! So glad it finally made it to the play store.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great customer service.  Theyvreoly within hours,even minutes. They address your comment and they app itself works extremely well. Proud to be a beta tester.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I chose to buy the + version because the dev seems pretty cool and invested in making a great app. 4 stars because I would really like to be able to customize outgoing and incoming message bubbles independent of color scheme, and I'm not the biggest fan of the font used in this app. I like the one used in Textra better, but I couldn't tell you why.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My messages don't always pop up and tell me I received them. Great concept, but it's just still too buggy for me.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Ur doing well.....,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Discards the message, which is currently written, and changes conversation to a new one, when I rotate the phone and screen orientation is changed.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Some of the messages can't be deleted in the app. Not sure why as I am able to delete it with stock messaging app.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Locks up phone for ~1.5 seconds each message :(,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Already this is sexy and sweet. However, I'm hoping you can add a small delay before sending a text, just in case.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Everything is good. Some minor problems. But I like it.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love this app. But when I am in a group chat my messages don't send unless I'm using mobile data.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's snappy and I love to be able to customize the appearance with so many colours. Dev is really responsive and supportive - keep it up it's amazing!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Such a nice app.. But can't block the unwanted senders. It's quite an essential feature for any sms app. Add that feature and this will become my permanent sms app.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,To Textra. I opened it and found even the settings to be very similar. Good app but now their is two.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Only thing is all contacts list for recipients would be nice. Instead of having to type the name to find it.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When you tap to view an MMS, it initiates a slideshow. If would be great if it let you view the MMS like Google's Messenger SMS app",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Black bar where soft buttons are. Use a custom ROM and true fullscreen should be possible! Otherwise great looking app.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But I didn't like the name. An option to block numbers should be added.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Beautiful app however I cannot send or receive pictures regardless of settings.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is quite refreshing! I'm running CloudyG3 on my G2 and the stock SMS app is looking good with it's flat design, but this app is on another level!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Has a few bugs but its a good start,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Loving the design and everything but can you allow users to change notification sound for individual people like in hangouts? Thanks.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Solid Dev who listens to users and updates often, would highly recommend!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Material is awesome but please i need multiple delete messages so i dont need to delete them one by one,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The only issue i have is a cant send pictures to my friends an error always comes up,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"What are you waiting for? Jump in and get QKSMS now - definitely the most stylish, easy to use text messaging app for Android.  5 stars all the way.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Definitely the best texting app, worth the upgrade to the plus version too!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,So beautiful. If only it could integrate Hangouts that would be amazing.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really love it so far. Great features and beautiful. Please continue to support. Thanks,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It wont set messages as read, no matter what i do. Have to go back to handcent for now :(",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love it, but for some reason I'm not seeing the contacts profile pictures.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Lol same thing like textra,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Amazing design, love the pixels!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really Great App. This is Material Design 2.0,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I'm missing the lollipop animations,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,custom fonts would make this perfect,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Latest update force closes every 5 minutes on my Note 4.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Both the app and developer are top notch.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,MMS doesn't work on T-Mobile Galaxy S6 Edge+,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The design and aesthetic is great. Just some issues with group message notification not showing up and attaching pictures doesn't allow you to change ur mind and ""x""  out. Also, there is no option to save photo by long pressing with save option or even delete it from the conversation.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Looks great and runs well. Has a night mode and color options,  default theme looks good and it wasn't as difficult as I expected to get MMS working. Love it  Edit: I've had some issues since my previous review. I've had the problem some others have mentioned where at times messages show up with phone numbers instead of contact names. In addition, I got a group MMS that would spam me with the notification but didn't show up in QKSMS at all. I had to change back to Hangouts, read it, and then switch my default back to QKSMS to get rid of it and the message still didn't show up. Lowering my score to a 4 because of the general bugginess but I'm going to keep using it.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app looks nice and performs well, and I really enjoy the interface customization. However, I have had issue with getting the notification LED color to be green, and not red on my particular device. I'm also consistently not notified of new Group or MMS messages. Overall, it's been a nice alternative to hangouts, and I'll be using it for the foreseeable future. Hope to see continued development and improvement.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've had this app for quite some time now, and every time there's an update, it essentially fixes many bugs. Except for one particular bug where the quick reply menu comes up, but with a blank space displayed. It either shows up as the person currently texting me or the one before (meaning that it isn't associated with the one currently texting me), but apart from that great job guys!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very nice app and functionality. A bit glitchy on my s4 for example the side tray still tries to pop up when disabled.. Unable to delete some messages. Minor niggles for an otherwise beautiful app. Will rate higher in future updates I believe...... Three days in I have uppers my rating. Still got glitches during transitions but I love the functions I will stick with this. This is in my opinion better than googles new app which is equally attractive but trounced on features.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great replacement to standard Texts App but had a few crashes... Would also be great to have an unread notification for the app when on the desktop and also see standard smiley face as an Android Emoji 😊 rather than :)!!  Add those extras and will pop it straight up to 5*'s!!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app so far however when I looked at a picture in one conversation, backed, and clicked to a different one it was the same picture as the previous conversation. Sort of annoying and would like to see a fix.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great design, I'm having problems with contact pictures loading properly, seems to be the ones from Facebook don't work but the Google ones do, not sure why. Shame I can't find out how to donate because it's a great app, fully recommended.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is really beautiful, like stunning. My only complaint is that I wish it handled Google Voice better.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I am unable to send messages to email addresses. Fix that issue and I'll give it 5 stars and use it again.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Used to be my favorite FREE sms app back in the days. Now the competition is way way better in terms of the Free features. ""Pulse"" as a simple example.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Beautiful, love the color options. The plus version is reasonably priced, too. It does everything I need in an sms app with none of the bloat of some other sms apps.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,So far it looks like this could be the one to knock chomp off the top of my list.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Was not getting notified of mms messages.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app has come a far way from its first releases. Now it is the most beautiful and feature rich messaging app. However this version is draining my battery like crazy!!! What did u guys do devs? Im so disappointed,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Recently could not send pictures anymore.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Pls put read button direct on popup and ability to attach contact number in message,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really enjoy the design scheme of this app, however I can't seem to send any mms messages with it. Back to hangouts for now...",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Please give dual sim function option for dual sim phones !!! Will give 5 star !!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really nice and good looking app!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Easy to use and very effective in case of battery,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,MMS is not working. I cannot send any pictures.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Will there be MMS gif support, location sending?",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,To have a widget.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,You added watch support but mms notifications still don't work?????,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's a nice change,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,An emoji app for this maybe ?,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love this app but it isn't able to select the APN for Verizon. It tells me to go select the the Preset for my career in MMS settings but there is no MMS Preset Setting.  Also I found if you want your contacts to have photos the the contact photo must be set from Gallery not imported from Facebook or Twitter.  Update : 02/23/15 Problems still exists,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Tmobile isn't showing my LTE APN settings as an option, just gprs and Metro pcs. That means mms fails entirely so I can't use this as a daily texting app. This is almost as good as Google's lollipop messenger, and then some.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been using QKSMS since its early alpha stages, and I've watched it become an amazing app due in large part to the dedication of its developer. It's not perfect yet, but even with the bugs that it has, it's more than usable and it's constantly being improved. QKSMS is definitely worth your time and money.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"However, there is some lag when going from conversation to conversation list. Also, it would be nice to see some of the other color options before I have to purchase the app to see them. Lastly, it would be great to be able to select different colors for in the ongoing and exposing messages rather than the same color as the theme.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Please add the option to have the keyboard auto open when you go into a conversation.  It's annoying to have to tap the text field every time to bring it up.  Also, the ""new message"" icon in the status bar should clear when you view the conversation but doesn't. Other than that, great work!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I was using EvolveSMS before, it was almost the perfection, then I tried QKSMS whom is very similar to it but it adds some features which makes it even better. Still it's not perfect, but it's my favourite app. The developers provide a great service.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is one of the nicest looking SMS apps available, seemingly combining the best bits of hello SMS and Textra SMS - minimalist, beautiful, and functional. Bugs to Work out: 1) Avatars don't always load correctly 2) Notification shows message count when that option is not selected, rather than showing a preview of the incoming message.  What would make it 5 stars: 1) Fix above bugs 2) .gif support 3) secondary color / backgrounds.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The design is beautiful! However the delete message button doesn't even work and I wish when I clicked the menu button better options would come up. Definitely a  potential and deserving 5 star app though.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It keeps asking me for my APN info. I'm on Verizon and other VZW users don't seem to be having an issue. Also very slow to boot, but quite speedy within the app when loaded. HTC One M8.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like this app but it keeps turning on my data automatically. Needs a fix unless there's a way to stop it from doing this.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app, however I am not able to send MMS messages. I tried setting up my APN but it still didn't work.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is good looking and customizable, which is a big plus. However, there are many, many issues with it. Force closing randomly, draft messages not deleting, slow after a while etc etc. Has lots of potential.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Been using this app since it was in Alpha and I can personally attest that the developers are great at listening to user suggestions.  If you're having a problem, message them and the support is great.  App is kickass too.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Still laggy when sliding, ticked enable tinted support status and navbar but nothing happened, no animation for conversation bubbles.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Good looking sms app but in very initial stage.  Need more feature like sending a contact via sms. Blocking  unwanted sms. Etc..,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Download this and give it a try, it really is quite powerful. Sending a message from inside another app is awesome! Although I would prefer it to pop up as a heads up notification rather than just pop straight up...",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app won't let me send sms because the auto detection feature won't work and there's no manual option to choose carrier like the toast notification says,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Some minor crashing and weirdness doesn't hold back how awesome this text messaging is,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Haven't been able to send group mms or solo mms. Interface is awesome tho.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Thought I had found my perfect sms app in hello but this is one step ahead. Taking it on a test drive. Impressed so far.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My main issue right now is that my contact photos will not appear in this app. That's something important to me.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great idea... Love the ability to change the colors. However there are some bugs that need worked out. One of the biggest problems so far is the inability to delete texts.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"But can you fix the nav bar,  checked the tinded navbar, but it changes color to black when my keyboard comes up. Kinda ruins the look tbh",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been using the app since its early beta days, but I just switched to a Verizon phone, and I'm having difficulties sending and receiving MMS with this app through Verizon.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app only misses by one thing: it needs to tell the user when it is not the default messaging app. I tried deleting a conversation, and it wasn't responding because  it wasn't set as the default",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Absolutely stunning on Nexus 5.  I really wish more developers would model their apps on the android design guidelines.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very beautiful app. Fully functional. No problems here. If dual-sim support is included, I'll buy the app in a heartbeat.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Got it working as my default SMS app now, works great! Design is good and the color schemes are just amazing! Definitely worth downloading!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Let's you choose colors, blends with lollipop excellently, great pop up for replies. Be sure to set it as your default messaging app, as it doesn't appear to prompt for that and it can cause issues with read message counts and such",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When I go to delete a message it won't delete no matter what I do. Also, I'd like to be able to change the color of the message bubbles to the color I choose",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I have HTC M8 and MMS messages aren't sending or being recieved. I can do both of those things with Hangouts but I love the customizability and the quick reply features of this a lot. So please take a look at that,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app exceeds in design and functionality, I think its the best one out on Google Play as of now! It has been getting better and better ever since beta!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Would've loved an sms filter based on sms content and not based on numbers. Spam is an issue.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Finally a good looking SMS app with strip non-unicode characters ability and no ads. Thank you! I will keep testing and will donate eventually at some point.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Only complaint is that when in a group MMS, it grabs a random picture from someone not in the group.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Swapped from textra the other day,  I'm liking all of the options and customization available.  Would it be possible to enable a swipe to dismiss gesture on the quick conversation Windows?",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Notifications is bugged as hell. But rest of the app is working great.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I cant recive photos and I have data and/or wifi please fix this,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Like so many sms apps I've tried I never get the full avatars of my contacts showing except for my stock android app or hangouts which showed all contact avatars,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Much better than dull android original SMS app.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very nice and fast SMS app.   Any chance of adding the option to prefix the ""*0#"" delivery report code for us who are stuck with inept networks?",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app. Just needs custom notifications per contact to be perfect. Will use as daily when this happens,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Please remove donate button after i donated,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this sms app but there is no option to select multiple conversations together and delete them.. If you can add that feature, 5 stars it is!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I would like to see the option to pin a conversation to a top of the conversation list and a scheduled sms would be nice to have.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Need to add quick reply on lock screen! But other than that, it's really good",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the app, question for the devs... I don't seem to get a sound alert when my screen is on and open to the conversation when a message comes in. Is this by design? If so, can we get an option to sound an alert?",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Versatile and lots of customizations. The best i've seen and used so far.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Best SMS app out there. Updates are frequent and the devs communicate frequently with the users.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Seems like the text is being cut off with symbols, for example :*** shows as :*",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Is it possible to fix the transparency on sense 6 or is that a root thing,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Copy of textra app ..slow app ..use mobile data when wifi is off,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The protocol. Not the app.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,didnt think 8sms could be beat but this wins hands down!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"If you would add, thats an edge over textra",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's good but it doubles my messages on Samsung galaxy s3,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I was wondering if there's dual SMS section in the full version? Can't find a feedback way in the app, so can u guys tell me?",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the design and function from the apps. But is this apps support dual sim capability ? Tried this now and it sends directly from my 2nd sim card. Explanation maybe :),5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Awesome! I wish it had a few more plus features though!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My messages cannot be deleted i tried a lot,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Looks lovely and does a great job, but stutters when my other apps don't! Xperia Z1 Stock",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Beautiful (loving the material design) and fast app. Keep up the great work!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,And keeps improving. Better than the new Google Messenger app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Way better than generic sms app that came with the phone,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Its a nice app have been using it eversince it came out but i still find it a bit slow but overall still works pretty good,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Thanks for fixed, I love this app",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Looks good... But Is it just me... It doesn't seem to really delete a conversation,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Frederick should install this app!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Needs wear support! Please,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This is really awesome sms app. Love it.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But no MMS notification on my VZW moto x 2014 :(,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Other than that, this looks/feels great! Will be replacing HandCent for me.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Looks lovely, but will not let me delete conversations! Why?",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Need ""private box"" and ""blacklist"" (block, silent block without any notify). Hope to see these features soon. Very nice UI, love so much.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Add animation and more theming,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like the look and feel, need widget",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,No notification sounds for mms.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The best SMS app, period.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice! And it works,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Well done.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love it!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Loving it!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Its not conpatible with 4.4.4???? Its not even opening.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Better than Hangouts,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Textra better,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Awesome,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Appealing,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,:D,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Battery killer,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Thanks for the recent great updates. A few more things are needed. Notifications only show number, not the name. Also, thanks for fixing the MMS, however, need to be able to save the picture. Keep up the great work. Looking forward to the next update. And it's so close to Google's new messenger app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I think it's the best once I finally figured out how to set up mms. Love the color choices, and I think its a very fluid app. There is one bug though where u try to fix the status bar, it crashes. Other than that, I wish I could give it 10 stars. Awesome!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is brilliant.. Exactly how a messaging app should be. There is a minor bug, when you let the list scroll in the conversations screen, the compose message floating button does not reappear unless you tap the screen and pull up slightly. Otherwise, a perfect app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The developer of this app knows a thing or two about material design! Love the ability to choose your colours and tinted status/navigation bar implementation. There is some slight lag on the swipe from the left menu, most noticeable when you launch the app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the app. It has finally taken over hangouts as my default. Little more work to do but I've been following this app and using it off and on since the start and you guys have done an amazing job!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,When replying through the popup the notification in the drawer doesn't go away until you press read.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Little bit problems with performance with lollipop. When these are solved 4 or 5 stars.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Installed and immediately tried to delete a conversation, which didn't work,  then tried to block a person I had blocked in textra,  which isn't even an option. It's pretty, but needs work.  Going back to textra for now",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Getting much better. Awesome app. The colors are amazing as well. I would like to see the ability to customize notification per contact. Then it would be perfect 5 star material.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Ironically, I've been looking for a new texting app recently to replace Textra. This app reminds me of an overhauled TextraSMS and is more customizable than Textra.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"All the same features I loved but better implemented. The icon sucks, but nova let me switch it. I'm all for great free apps that only get better with the purchase. Already recommended to a lot of friends!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The overall design and the range of user customization is great, however I would really appreciate more animations and better attachment system. Currently switching back to default android L messaging app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Followed it through the alpha process and the last few versions have really moved it forward so it's now my default SMS app. Really enjoy the look and feel and look forward to the app progressing. Top stuff!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Please move the attachment button. I keep hitting it on accident after sending a message,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Been using this since the first  alpha on G+, glad to see it reach release! Lag free, clean and beautiful Material Design UI. No hassle, no fuss - it just works, and it works well. Amazing. It's got all the features I want (even Pushbullet integration!). Wonderful developer, always receptive to feedback.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, liked it instantly. Very clean looking and simple functionality",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,At last the perfect SMS app!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The best,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Beautiful,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"A few features I feel the app would benefit from but for a beta this is great EDIT: For example, being able to have the facebook profile pictures of contacts set as the contact's portrait in QKSMS. This works in the stock messaging app but I don't see that capability in this app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I can't use APN it says it's set up with my carrier but pictures never get sent. It always force closes on me and sing be my daily driver. I have tried this app 4 times since the original beta version and our only seems to get worse and worse. Not even worth the one star!!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app looks great if you are to see a screenshot and it functions well, but attention to details put me off. No animation for sending a message is a really bad pet peeve I have.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've tried them all,  this just works for me. And it looks pretty nice too.  A few bugs here or there,  but I've been using it since it was in alpha and the development team is really responsive and transparent.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Formerly used Textra, Handcent SMS, Stock Messenger and a bunch of others. This is so slick looking, operates cleanly, and doesn't take up too much space.  The preview feature is so handy and convenient.  Night mode is wonderful.  Gladly paid for the enhanced version.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Lots of customization. But I couldn't delete messages/conversations. When it prompts me if I want to delete, I press Yes and it doesn't do anything. I really need that option. Please fix asap.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My main issue is with the disabling status bar gradient option. When I try to select it, the app crashes and the option does not get enabled.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very good app no complaints. Bought the QKSMS+ to support local KW devs. One thing I would like to see in the app is custom vibration pattern.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been using qksms for a few months now and it's by far my favorite SMS app, nothing compares.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just downloaded it after hearing out was released to the public.  Such a cool messing app, everything send very smooth and the quick reply feature is awesome!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It would be 5 stars if it didn't say ""no subject"" in front of every group message",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App is really good so far it took me away from textra one glaring issue to me is that it doesn't open the conversation you hit from notification bar it just opens the app. So if you had another conversion open in the app you might end up replying to someone you didn't want to.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,A small lag when openning a conversation wish it could be fixed. Aside from that its perfect,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Not had any problems  great so far best looking and design message app around....android l notification would be a good add ..,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very excited about the future of this app! Even if it is still a bit buggy, the devs are so responsive that I am not worried!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is by far the most aesthetic sms applications I've used to date. I've been very keen on using hangouts for the last year, but after 5 minutes on this, I doubt I'll be switching back.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Thrilled to have been using this in beta. Combines all the best features I like from various messaging apps. Would love to see a swipe to delete/mark read/etc. option in conversation list and pop ups? Thanks!!!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Works perfectly and looks amazing. No APN trouble like textra or other SMS apps. Very fast and responsive.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"been using this as a tester for months and now it's already out for the public to use.   if you want a sms app that is pleasing to the eyes and have awesome features you should use QKSMS. Thumbs up to ""Moez Bhatti"" for this wonderful app :)",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,When I first laid eyes on QKSMS I was blown away. It was the first messaging app to adopt material design and I thought it looked amazing. I'm happy to say that it has only got better and better. Cheers!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I've been using QKSMS for months and it's really great. Congrats on the alpha release guys :),5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'm not sure if this feature is already available and I just can't find it, but I usually have my data off and it turns on occasionally to receive MMS, but does qksms have that option where it will turn on data temporarily to receive MMS and then turn off again? That would be great!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Been using the beta for awhile now and it keeps getting better and better. Officially my default texting app.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I use this all the time. Colors are great. Joined the beta before the public. The QK is amazingly useful to not have to leave the app to answer a message. Would recommend.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,By far the best SMS out there I'm so excited for the public release as I hope people will appreciate it as much as I do !,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Its still buggy. MMS messages sometimes don't come through or send. It needs to be fixed. Other than that, the app is wonderful, and I hope to see its continued development.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Still missing some functionality such as taking a picture within the app rather than selecting from gallery everytime.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I'm running this on my nexus 5 and then I open a conversation there is always a little bit of stuttering. It has been like that for months. I hope you can fix it one day.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Been using the beta version for a few months now on my Moto X. My favorite texting app by far. Beautiful design in line with Material Design. Smooth and fast with no lag. Quick reply works great. Developer has kept it up and is attentive to users. Highly recommended.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very stylish. I look forward to seeing more functionality as the app develops. For me, Evolve sms, is the top dog. It has great features and I love the smooth sending animations. Eye candy for sure, but an important part of the mobile phone expierience in 2014. Fluidity is an important aesthetic! I wish you all the best!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Having beta tested this app for many months, I can honestly say that there aren't many developers this attentive, I don't think he sleeps!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very beautiful app and the dev puts in a lot of work into this app and is responsive to feedback and suggestions. Great app and an even better developer.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I'm using a bright magenta theme right now and I LOVE IT. Keep up the great work!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Simple to use with just enough features so that its not overwhelming in its customization. The design is very pleasing because its simple and straightforward!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This is a fantastic app. The (expandable) quick reply, among other features, ensures an effortless experience. On top of that, the app has a beautiful design (with joyful animations!), and developers who work hard to make the app the best it can be, and who care about their users.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Have been using this since its alpha release, it's a gorgeous app, customizable, and full of useful features. MMS has been working since the beta so no complaints here!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the app.  Seriously, 5 stars off the bat.  Would it be possible to change the attachment selector to the native file picker?  I use my different cloud accounts to send files at work.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Been using this since the beta and have fallen in love with it,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been in the beta for a while now, and each update makes the app so much better, but the 1.0.0 release has me force closing whenever I try and open a conversation! And I still don't have any check boxes for my settings! Are there any fixes I should know about?",5

com.moez.QKSMS,TJ,"Please bring back the old icon, I don't like how this one is essentially just a hollow ring, I can barely see it on most of my wallpapers no matter whether I make it black or white 😕",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Most of the texting that I do is group texting with my team, and there are 10 people in the chat. This app seemed to work well with it,  which many others do not. When I got a long string  of different messages from different people,  the name of who sent each was under the text. But then,  after 10 seconds or so, the names disappear, and I can no longer see who sent what. If I wanted to,  I would have to force close the app and then reopen it just to see who sent what for another 10 seconds.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the look and feel of the app as well as all the customization. There are a couple bugs though that made me switch back to my default messaging app such as poor integration with lightflow a notification handling app. Also, with Android L, I would get 2 notifications when the screen was on. One for the quick reply and one for the actual notification from the Android OS. Other than that it is a fantastic app going in the right direction. Will be checking on progress as you continue to develop.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Fantastic app that would just need one more change to make it five stars from me. Changes need to be made to the blocked messages section. Firstly the option to password protect this part of the app, furthermore the ability to hide it in the menus but access via holding down the compose button (as with GoSMS and a couple of others).  Other than that, perfect. For the reason above though I would have to stick with GoSMS",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really do want to use this as my primary sms/mms texting app. It's easily the nicest material looking app but it's very unoptimised. I needs to load my conversations every single time I open them and force closes randomly sometimes to the point of restarting the phone.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Installed on Motoro XT1045. Initially I liked the appearance and customization but soon experienced glitches. The most annoying one is that the keyboard keeps disappearing at random times while typing. This makes the app unusable. Second issue was that I was unable to send video MMS. Went back to the stock messaging app, which is not customizable in appearance but at least is reliable and let's me type.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Highly customizable thats what love about this app. But on my Xperia Z Ultra, I cant seem to get rid of the gradient on status bar and navigation bar, if I turn tinting off then both bars will turn black, tried the option in advanced setting, no luck either. Also, going into sms threads lag unpleasantly",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love thw app so far haha. I switched over from Textra. It felt less stable. And less fast. I do however miss being able to the message text from the reply window, changing the notification icon color for different people and a few other things like setting timed messages. Overall great app tho!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,That is the app i was looking for and finally i have it. But when i get notification on lock screen and i unlock the phone it enables data connection and some times cast screen.. Some times i open msg notification from status bar it doesn't show mag until i close and open again Pleaaaase fix these bugs .. I will give 6 stars.. I don't wanna delete tht ap..,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app idea but two major issues.  First being that the delay sending of messages did not work for me. Also,  within a few minutes of using it became quite laggy and almost unusable.  Had to uninstall for those reasons but will keep an eye out to see if issues are corrected.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love it although i cant see it completely. I have a meizu mx4 and i really like the app but the app doesnt mix well with my screen ratio. Hope devs can attend to my problem cause the app is good and simple then after i will rate this with 5 stars. Thank you.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really appreciate the good work but it would have been real convenient if you guys give lockscreen notification options when the sensitive option is active in the privacy settings on lollipop (like hangouts give the lock screen notifications, its like 2 new messages from two conversations.) Plus i dont get my screen turned on upon receiving the text on my nexus 5. Furthermore please give the whole conversation on pop up. I would really appreciate if you grant me with a few updates satisfying me. :)",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The UI and the app itself is execellent but could use some changes. For example the add buttin in a conversation should be on the left side and adding a voice recorder would benefit alot of people. Also the focus too much on the UI cause a little lag on the app. Making the response performance better would be greatly appreciated. This app is all around the biggest competitior of textra but, it'sHard to decide but for now i will use qksms and see what they improve on it and such.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I would love to use this as my default sms app, but it's been constantly keeping my phone awake when the screen is off, draining 10-20% overnight. I even reinstalled it and tried it again and the same thing happened. Please come up with a fix",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"As of now, its in good shape, i would request to improve the spam filter to add support for all numbers not in contacts and folders which can filter some messages based on set criteria, and label them. For such amazing sms app, these would really add value, appreciate the efforts",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I participated in the app beta and brought up the matter then, but I see that QKSMS has been released and it's still not done. The problem: When I compose an SMS, this app still doesn't display a character counter. How am I supposed to know if I'm getting close to the character limit? I'm not interested in having the app break up long messages into multiple SMS. I just need to know how much space I have left so I can make the most of one SMS.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Good app. Few suggestions if I may: Add multi-select for deleting messages in a thread / Bigger pop-up / Pop-up options to be visible & configurable, not in a drop down menu / When sending a new message, a drop down list with the latest called contacts would be nice.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Omg I downloaded this app and LOVED the material UI. That's where my love stopped. The m and n keys stopped working on my keyboard and I kept getting a persistent message that said ""message not found or expired"". Thought that was the worst of it until my brother called me and cursed me out because my phone was sending him and his gf the same message over 125 times. Wish I was making this story up.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app looks sleek and nice and is easy to read. The settings menu is difficult to navigate and could definitely be cleaned up, though. Along with that there are some big drawbacks to using this app. The inability to clear multiple conversations, MMS not working at all, and not being able to copy text from messages really make me want to switch back to the basic messaging app. I'm going to stick it out a little in hopes that it changes, but it sucks losing out on functionality.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like the direction this app is headed. It's a nice mix of the things I like from both textra and google messenger. But there are still many bugs. Especially with group messaging, I couldn't figure out who was saying what in my group message. If the bugs get fixed in future updates this could end up being my favorite SMS app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app. It's pretty, customizable enough, and I haven't had any bugs like in textra (and the no ads are a plus). The only thing that I don't like is there isn't a way to send video, and there isn't a way to choose emoji style. I would definitely upgrade to plus version if these features were added.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really love this one mainly because it is open source and has awesome features plus look. The only thing currently keeping me away is that it should also have dual sim support. I hope dual sim feature will be added someday. Thanks,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When making changes to customize your app, like the font, the changes don't take effect unless you scroll up or down and then back. If it had more customization options like ChompSMS, it would be better and I would definitely pay.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Was a great app until I suddenly ceased receiving audible notifications. My husband thought I was angry with him, but I had to explain that my messenger stopped giving notifications I could hear. I'd have to check periodically. And it stopped blocking the spam texts. And yes, of course I made sure all settings were properly applied. I'm going to reinstall. Because that might help. I shouldn't have to though...",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app has a great look and feel to it but still has some issues to work out. MMS is really poor, with the pop up notification not sending to the whole group on group messages. Also having trouble with it marking messages as read. A few more bugs to knock out and it will be a great app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"A great alternative to Google Messenger. I was looking for an better UI alternative to Textra, and I loved the feel/UI of QK, but it lacked many of the message functionality that I love in Textra (sending scheduled messages, VCards, and GIFs). Overall great app and I'm sure it's only going to get better. Love to support open-source software.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is pretty much perfect. The only way to improve it would be to add the option to assign different colors to every contact, sort of like Google messenger does. My main problem that stops me from using it is the fact that the app crashes all the time. I'll reinstall it in a couple of weeks to see if that gets fixed",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice design and functions well. Proximity sensor to call is a bit broken. When I place my phone on a desk while in a conversation it will start a call.  Fix that and customizable swipe functions like mark as read or delete a conversation and this app would get 5 stars. - Running on OnePlus 3 PureCM Rom,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'd pick someone's name to respond to, and it would send the message to someone else, which makes things confusing. It would claim it sent messages also, but then send them a day or two later. Overall this made for a very confusing time. Not worth it.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Installed to work with should I answer? app but this qk changes settings itself even after I've changed them back. Also, didn't notify with sound of new messages.  Had to constantly check the app to see if I had a message. Settings menu should be less complicated and settings should stick once I set them myself. Overall,  uninstalled after two days of trying multiple things to make it work properly.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I so wanted to love this app, I enjoyed how customisable it is as made my Samsung Galaxy S7 look more my style,  and that it works with the ""Should I Answer"" app, to block spam messages - however, this app fragments every text I send, even short ones with only a few words - are received in several texts,  often splitting individual words that need piecing together, as are always received out of sync! Each splintered text causes a notification, basically blowing up the recipient's phone, which they find embarrassing!! If I found this out sooner, I wouldn't have used it for the past couple of months! 😰  It's crazy how something so fundamental can ruin an otherwise great app, but this has, this fault has made the app useless!  ☹",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Disappointing that there's poor support for group sms otherwise this would be near perfect. All I want is a clean, simple sms app with the ability to quickly text a group of friends regularly. Should be able to create, manage and message a group.  Everything else is well handled.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"There's only one reason why I don't use this app (as well as Textra). I do a lot of group messaging, and when you try to add multiple recipients, after you type in a name, the cursor goes straight to the ""message section,"" rather than staying in the ""contacts section"" so that I can continue to add more recipients. I have to go tap the contacts section again to add more people. Not an issue for many, but an annoyance for me. Otherwise, great app!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Used to be cool. Now I can't send or receive MMS after I upgraded to N7. I Only needed it because my stock msg app was incompatible with my spam blocker. Now I have to switch default msg apps to send/rec a pic. Doesn't seem like the app will ever be updated again.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"i like it, it looks really nice and whatnot, but the auto mms settings threw my phone off so bad that i had to factory reset it to get them back. that and every mms i get now shows up as the same one picture. it might be promising in the future but as of right now it just isn't there yet.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"!!!Be Warned!!! Great App except it will continually sign you up to Premium SMS and also continually uploads your private data, messages and microphone on demand to a private paid Amazon server service in the background. I presume the App is legit because of the quality so i assume security it just compromised in the app itself or the server to which it communicates. So much for the Open Source appeal!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It took up to 5 seconds just for my texts to pop up in the conversation. Half the time it wouldn't open. I cant customize the light notification to individual contacts in another app like i can with textra. Plus the texts don't show up on my lock screen. I think the colors are amazing but at this point are to many bugs going on at this point i cant use it.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Clean interface and nice to use. Doesn't offer as many features as textra. Ended up changing back as the app would cause a lot of hanging on my phone and after the last few updates crashed on occasion too.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,MMS is really buggy and mostly doesn't work. Can't download pictures. Also there is no animation when sending or receiving texts. Was going to switch from Google Messenger but not anymore unless MMS is fixed. Otherwise it's one of the best sms apps on the Play Store. Developer needs to focus on the main problems first instead of adding new features. Will give 5 stars if this problem is fixed.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,QKSMS is the messaging app I want to use but the bugs just make it intolerable. Can't handle group messages without crashing.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The pop up quick reply is buggy and the app will make your pop up notifications for Facebook messenger disappear. If the bugs were fixed I would gladly give a 5 star rating and redownload. Everything was great beside that,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is just awesome and full of features I wanted in a single app. The interface with tabbed conversations, the new button from Lollipop Messenger, the overall animations are nice.  I would rate it 5 stars if it had the option to set custom ringtones for individual contacts.  I also noticed few bugs like there is no delete confirmation dialog box, please add it as its important. Also, the search button works like expected but, clicking on the search result should open that particular message instead of taking to the bottom of that conversation.  Keep up the good work!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the look and flow of this app, but my only gripes are: 1) lack of notifications for group mms. When I receive a group text, the only way I can tell that it's been received is by going into the app itself. All the notifications work for single person texts only. 2) frequently the quick text reply defaults to the previous sender, so if I get a text from person B, the quick text reply is for person A.  If these issues were fixed, I'd definitely switch fully to QK!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My saved contacts are not displayed when I receive a message I just see the number instead.. I found no option in settings. Kindly help me out.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I initially downloaded this app 2coincide with ""should I answer."" At 1st it was ok. Luv the theme changing 4each person. After a while I found several flaws n the app. Which were 1) It doesn't allow all messages 2come thru. I was missing out on quite a few mms messages & some sms. 2) It doesn't keep messages n last n at the top. My most frequent person I would txt, I always had 2scroll down 2find her name 2send another message 2her. 3) The same most frequent person had an exclamation mark next 2her name 4about a month. It was because when I sent a pic message, it never went thru. It was being held as a draft 4some reason. & There's no place 2pull up drafts. 4) Some mms messages were being sent sideways. 5) There's a delay n sending & receiving messages. & I didn't have it set 4a delay. 6) When I'm using another app on my fon & get a message, other apps pause & close out, giving this app priority. I don't always want 2read my messages right away. Especially if I'm already doing something else with my fon. I had 2go back 2my original txtn app. If u can fix these bugs, then I'd rate a 5 & re-download it. Thanks",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just started using this app and I love 99%of it, but it has one issue that keeps me from using it.  On a galaxy S7 edge on T-mobile, I can't send MMS with WiFi on.  Tried changing the settings but nothing worked.  If this gets fixed I'm going back ASAP.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app has everything I was looking for both function and aesthetically but, with my Nexus 5 running Lollipop, it crashes so often that it's almost impossible to use.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Almost the best SMS app I've tried: quick to launch, sleek interface and  beautiful police, and most of all open source!  A few downsides though:  -you can't disable that clicking on a contact icon in the app opens the contact page, and not the conversation  -i didn't find if it is possible to send group messages as SMS instead of MMS  -locked screen notifications don't seem to work if I set a password   Overall, I find it very good and use it daily  @Moez Bhatti : Somehow I can't reproduce my bug. I have configured QKSMS so that when I get a message, it is displayed as a popup even if my phone is locked.  A few weeks back I had a password to my lockscreen and I couldn't manage to have this popups displayed, I had to unlock the phone. So I disabled the password and everything worked fine. Today, I tried to reproduce my problem and I couldn't. I don't know if the bug was a side effect of sorts that has been corrected since then, or if I changed something in my phone config, or if the recent update of Android I installed has something to do with it... Anyway, if I can reproduce my problem some day I'll open a bug report on GitHub but for now it's all good.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It is a functional app but it just stops working. I made it my default text app and it worked for a day then just stopped. I changed my default to the previous app and back to QKSMS. I receive one text and it stopped again. I'll just go back to Textra.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,For those who liked but now doesnt have samsung messaging app this is perfect choice. Would be nice to have scheduled sms option.,5

First, sometimes when you go into a message thread, pictures from MMS' sometimes don't show up or show up all as an older or random picture until you back out and back into that thread. Secondly on AT&T, group MMS' take 10-20 seconds longer than the usual 3-5 seconds (I tested with other apps; it's not the carrier), and don't send sometimes until another group member has texted back.

screen. My phone heats up a lot, and then the app fails. Not sure what's 
going on. :(",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Looks like a great app will rate. Proper amount of stars when fixed,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Android notifications link to the previous conversation rather than the conversation from the notification.  Group message replies send a single message to each person in the group rather that the group as a whole.  Will not use again.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Could make quick response more convenient. Respond from lock screen and don't have quick response take up center of screen.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really like this app but I notice when its sending and receiving messages there's sort of a lag. I'm not sure if it's my phone or the app causing the problem :/,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So many random glitches. When it works it's great. Problem is, it rarely works without issues.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice app. I like its features. But most of the time it stops responding and won't open. When it does the avatars in the conversation list are reset to default. Please address this issue. Thanks.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app. It's beautiful, works well, and packs enough customization to make it feel unique. However it has a horrible lag issue. I can't do anything on it without it takes 3-5 seconds to figure out what I want. I'll gladly re-download once this issue is fixed.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app is really great but sometimes text messages remain ""sending"", it takes terminating the app, reopen, copy the old text, paste & send, deleting the old text to fix. Very annoying. Please fix if this is a bug. Thank you and keep the excellent work up!!!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the features, the pop up messaging, the way I can change the color of everything. It's broke though. Worked great for a week or two and then it keeps force closing and not responding. Uninstalled.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Battery issues fixed but it is now buggy and unstable. Avoid it. Shame it was good before they ruined it. Please roll it back!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App wouldn't let me mark messages as read. Didn't have all my contact names. No contact pictures. Poor.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Sometimes takes way too long to open. Need to use this more to really see the pros & cons,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app has issues with saving attachments from MMS. I was unable to save pictures that were sent to me. Had to uninstall for that reason.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Personally I think textra is Better you have to add a feature that makes it stands out. When that happeneds I will get it another try.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"But I just experience crashes when I try to edit bubbles, and some lags upon scrolling in all conversations and expanding and scrolling on pop up. But totally reliable and clean app. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Some animation lag when tapping to open conversations but not a big deal. Support for Android N's notification quick reply would be really nice!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Good app, lots of features but no emoji,contacts buttons in shortcuts, needs an update to fix it.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'd like the option to have system font, delete multiple messages in a conversation, and better mms. Other than that I really like it",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Qksms is fast, Reliable and it has a lot of customizations, with them we can change the entire look and the way of we text. A must have App for sure",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Everything is perfect. But every time i scroll it lags a lot. It would be great if it could be fixed. Thanks,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Lots of lag when scrolling,  both in conversations and through the conversation list",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very nice that scheduled sending of messages is now included. This has become my default sms app. Now, only encryption is the thing left to do for this nice sms app",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Joi Gleeners,No ability to mark SMS MMS as unread. Has any of you tried sending images/photos (MMS) using this app instead.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app works and look great. However, none of my pictures get sent 
recently since this update and it isn't working well for me. I hope the 
devs update this as i was thinking about getting the qksms +",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Very happy with this. I only wish I could delete messages through the 
pop-ups. I hope that's something you'd consider in the future.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It suddenly stopped opening up. Even reinstalling it didn't work.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,great app but please make it more like Google messenger for fluid design. It's too condensed,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love it! Immediately changed from Android messages to your app! I was 
searching so long for exactly what you have here! I even paid it. The only 
thing I'm missing would you add a sound when you're sending a message and 
when you receive one while you're still in the convo? Would be so much help",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"As small as the app it, it was one of the slowest and laggy apps on my phone. It often didn't open and took awhile to receive texts. I'm on a Moto Z Force Droid, so not exactly a lightweight phone either.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The app looks and feels amazing when it works. Sadly, it freezes 40% of the time I launch it. Not reliable for normal use.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Newest update absolutely ruined the app. Nothing works right, consider 
yourselves shunned",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I have an S4 on ATT. I never get MMS SBD group texts with this app. It is really beautiful though. I use Textra because I don't have these issues.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Terribly glitchy and never shows full conversation immediately, sometimes it stayed blank. Tried sending a picture message to a friend and ended up sending it to a random number.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,And it just can't handle group texts right. Constantly failing to send or receive.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My phone support 2 sim cards, but unfortunately there's no option to choice which sim card i want to use :( please add that option",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"OK, all I want is the ability to draw something and send it as a GIF showing how you drew it, like Mood Messenger. I don't like using Mood so I've been dying for this feature.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Please add quick reply from lockscreen after tapping on the notification. Popup should open directly. It should open when you tap on the notification. Have this feature and this app will be top sms app,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Best thing about this app is it is open source. The only missing thing in this app is scheduled messaging; otherwise perfect app. Finally resorting to this app after trying 5 SMS apps,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The new version is not as good as the old version, their whole re so many 
options in old version, I really loved the old version but since I have 
updated, have lost all the customization, and so had to uninstall the APP. 
Other I had really loved the old version APP",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I'm giving you guys two stars because it hasn't been updated since September 2016. It's like you guys have abandoned it. I hope it's something in the works for this app because I like the potential of this app.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'm unable to mark conversations as read, my navigation bar is dark gray with a gradient I instead of black and I can't delete conversations.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love this app, i love the design and its sleek feature. But what i hated about this app is that sometimes i didn't receive notifications. Hopefully they will address this problem as soon as possible.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Totally unusable at times. There is an excessive amount of bugs that makes this app not worth the features it provides at all.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"There is this bug recently where if I minimize the app and come back to it, it looks like I have no conversations. And then it crashes.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Latest version is broken. Launching the app and opening a conversation, actually doesn't load the contact number and name, which means that I can't send an SMS without a targeted phone number. I need to exit and open it again. Sometimes I forget about this issue, type a message and hit send, the app then empties the writing box and displays an error, so I have to type everything again.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I cannot get pictures to send on my Verizon LG G3. I've tried every automatic configuration. I would love to use this app as my default, but I can't!",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I think the app icon is kinda not catchy. Change your icon to something cute or something simple.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Excellent SMS app implementation. Beautiful. Please donate so it can continue to be improved. People's (developer) time is never free.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,…no matter what I tried I couldn't get MMS to send within a responsible amount time. Switched back to Textra for reliability.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I don't know what happened recently but this app will no longer open on my 
phone. I paid for the app but so far all the features don't work ie: 
delayed sending, sending pictures, and attachments. It just crashes so I 
uninstalled it.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Ive had this app for at least 6mos-1yr and up until 2months ago it worked fine. Now, Even after updates it keeps force closing on my Note 3. Uninstalling",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very laggy and caused phone to reboot. The interface seems cluttered.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app., thanks to the developer.  Unfortunately  I had to uninstall it since I have a dual SIM phone.  If in the future it does support it,  for sure I install it again.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love it, but it has been sending more than one copy of a message to another person, so when I send ""Hey"" they receive it 3 times, it vice versa.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Looks great but ran very sluggish in my phone. Other than that it looked perfect,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I want to love it. Its aesthetics are beautiful. But it has clunky issues. It has just too many minor issues. It simply isn't as good as Textra, as much as I would want it to. I prefer open source but this doesn't cut it, sadly. It's not bad. It's a definite second place on the Android store.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Everything's working well before the last two updates, now I can't seem to view my conversations. I really love this app, please fix. Asus Zenfone 5",2

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I can't receive or send messages for this. Why did I pay for something that doesn't work.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Doesn't work every time I go to use it it says start failed please try again,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It would often crash on my note 4. It also would not properly change colors for night time (white on white background..). Group messages would reply only to one person, mms slightly buggy. Does not receive contact .vcf files properly.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It would be nice to have more themes. Also, I couldn't figure out how to insert emojis. There should be a smiley face indicator that is easily accessible.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Checked out the app. Impressive, but needs a feature to delete old text messages so that the app doesn't swell and take up a lot of space. Evolve has it, which is why I can't move away from that app just yet. This app reminds me of textra. Textra also needs the delete old messages feature. If that feature is added, I'd install and use.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is great! Except the quality of my outgoing MMS messages is degraded even if I select unlimited MMS size,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I still have type each message every time and confusing to setup.just not what I am looking for.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,But could you add an option to change the text colors? Otherwise I had to edit the file to make it suited to my taste. But I don't want to do that everytime I feel like changing the text colors.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Been using this app for 3 days, just uninstalled it now. It crashes and sometimes wont display the messages.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Closes after every text, sometimes loses texts. Nice looking, but terrible function.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Well, I originally found this app while watching a YouTube video named ""Top 10 Best Texting Apps For 2016"" and this was listed as the number 1 app. I downloaded it and it worked for a little bit... well after a while it started to close the entire app when I tried to open a conversation with a friend.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the look and feel of this app, but unfortunately, I keep getting a ""com.android.phone"" when sending MMS. Really disappointing that this app doesn't support MMS for my S7. Had to uninstall after not finding a fix for this.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Best third party app messaging app. Best for replacing the old stock one. Simple and fast. Im so happy. It meets all my customization setting! Much better than android messages(google android messages).,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,My phone is dual sim...That app doesn't work proper in my phone and I want to see my message words limit...Please recommond any app that needs are have. Thanks,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I could not delete any messages.  I clicked on 'delete conversation'  but nothing happens.  For this reason I uninstalled it.  Would reinstall if this was fixed,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It works good just it keeps sending the same picture message like 5 or 6 times plz fix and I'll change my review,2

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Absolutely love the look and design of the app. Unfortunately I was unable to receive or send picture messages at this time on my Note 5 for TMobile.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's really good, however i can't upgrade to QKSMS+, it always fails at billing.  Edit: This version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play. Check the help center for more information.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Thankfully I had my previous text app set not to auto download MMS.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Fantastic app, needs a little work on the text input area though. I use the version on the F-Droid app store so I get the full paid version free. Thanks for making a great open source text app!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Please fix the lag when opening the conversations, and the app loaded empty conversations for people I haven't texted with.  Other than that I think it is getting there.  Keep up the good work!!!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"If it would stop crashing and constantly be force closing. It had a perfect layout, easy to use but the never ending crashes is a deal breaker for me",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"No matter what I do, MMS will not work on Verizon. Beautiful app, bit very frustrating!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,No scheduled msg sending :-( and many other good features are missing,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The title says it all. This app allows you to customize the look and feel. Plus it is open source that rocks!,5

send images even after changing the compression size.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Crashes every time i open it.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,its annoying that the below of the txt is still sending but its totally send i taught its was lagging but when i restart my its still the same please fix bug .. to make it 5 star .. thanks,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,There is no dual sim feature..it is a great drawback..else are excellent,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,why there's no notiication sound? Am i the only one who experience this type of issues? I like how the ui looks like but the problem that i have mentioned is the only reason why i am not using this app. If you fix this issue i will recommend this to the others.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's very handy and good but the multimedia doesn't work as good it will double send in your phone,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very nice looking app. Only two items I would suggest improvement on are to allow the attachment of a GIF from Gboard keyboard in the text field and to preview photos or videos in the default apps and not in the QK app itself. Keep up the good work!,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Some glitches I could live with, but having to MMS via ANY other app was 
just too ridiculous! Uninstalled..",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It cannot give specific notification settings to specific numbers like in go sms and handcent sms. Like giving another ring tone and vibration pattern and another notification icon to a certain number(s) Otherwise  its very cook,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Unfortunately contact numbers with country codes aren't recognized their names,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Would easily be 5 stars if MMS would work. Almost not worth having this as my default messaging app...,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,SMS keeps showing as unread even after reading it.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Freezes all the time! The pop up message window will often times pop up and not show the incoming message and then when you try to expand the window into full screen mode, it freezes in a black screen.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Proximity sensor to make calls is overly sensitive. Reply from lock screen doesn't keep you on lock screen or return you there.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I tried over and over again to look for the instructions how to give each conversation with its own ringtone. I couldn't find it. That is huge for me.  And if the background could be multi colored. Other than that,  I did enjoy the app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is causing massive battery drain on my N5 (took about 40% in like 5-6 hours when phone was idling!). Otherwise app is great looking and useful.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Lovely design, had all the features I was looking for, but still has a MMS wakelock that keeps devices awake when they should be asleep, killing the battery.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really fast and stable SMS/MMS app... The devs will get back to you with information that you need should you email them... I encourage you to go for the paid version!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,When sending a message it takes a minute to show up on the conversation.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"As a former beta tester, you decided it would be a good idea to charge us to change colors. We helped you fix bugs and now you betray us?",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When creating a new message, I can't find a way to access the groups from my contacts list - definitely can't leave textra without the addition of that feature.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really great idea and project except for the fact that it does not support group messaging which is a huge deal breaker and received images end up displaying in a broken galley format. I hope these are fixed soon because everything else is nearly perfect!,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It looks great, but doesn't function as well. Will visit this again later on after it gets more fleshed out.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Good app, simple. But after the update its laggy. Then may I request for unread messages nos. in icon? Thanks.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really want to try it but i think it should be able to send emoticon/emoji.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"When I uninstalled qksms, my android messaging app constantly says I have 11 new messages. I can't figure out how to get it to no unread messages. It's a very visually appealing app, and has great features, but I still prefer the standard app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This is the best sms app I've used (and I've tried a lot). The best thing of all: itps open source!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really like the App but can you add an individual notification settings? i really like to have important people like my family have different message tones with other contacts. just a suggestion tho. thanks for the app BTW. i hope you read my review :),4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"MMS fails every time. The app says it can't auto-load the APN settings. Inputting the settings manually doesn't work (I'm on Verizon). Since MMS didn't work, I didn't take an opportunity to test out the rest of the features of the app.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Switched from textra, but this doesn't provide a way to change color for different contacts",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Crashes most of the time. Smooth but... Shitty. Pls fix it. Its a cool 1 though,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Works, but is worthless.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It would've been just the perfect app for me to handle text messages, but a bug ruined it for me: it didn't show the names from my contact list, only the numbers.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app is an exact copy of Textra. It functions the same as all messaging apps but it copies Textra entirely in look.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Love the app..however will replace my existing sms app only when it has the feature to pin messages to the top..or star messages,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It is not absolutely applicable to my phone, I am using dual sim what I need is an option where i can select which sim will I use to send my message the time i press the send icon",3

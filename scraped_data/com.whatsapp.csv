com.whatsapp,Karen B,"I'd give more than 2 stars if I could reach someone to resolve issue. Whenever I attempt to attach photos/video from gallery, it wont allow me to select them. Of course, I also have to select Gallery from the 3 buttons on the right, but regardless, I cannot select and send. This is very frustrating as I use this for work and used to be able to do this with captions for each pic. Now I have to attach, write caption, send and do it again (from another app!)",2
com.whatsapp,Hilmy B,"Was good. But the latest update doesn't allow you to select multiple pictures to send, you have to send one at a time. It now also requires multiple steps to get to your album just to be able to share pics. So you have to go through multiple steps to get to your gallery (which wasn't intuitive after years of using it) and you can only select 1 pic at a time.....",1
com.whatsapp,RAF Strayhorn,"It's a good app and it does the job but changing from one phone to another is a total nightmare and nobody seems to be able to explain how to do it. The web instructions are confusing and wrong, the independent websites are confusing and wrong, and I just want to transfer everything, including chats, from an old phone and number to a new phone and number. I feel like it would be easier to build a faster than light spaceship and I also feel like it's a lot harder than it absolutely has to be",3
com.whatsapp,Rick C,"Been using whatsapp on my main chromebook flawlessly for about a year. Very few issues. A week or so ago, it started to crash about 90 seconds into my video chats. I would start it up again, and it would inevitably crash again. I would say out of 10 conversations, 9 would crash after about 1 and 1/2 to 2 minutes in. Very ponderous and frustrating. Switched the whatsapp app to another chromebook, same issues. Cleared storage, reinstalled, same. Will switch to another app that actually works.",2
com.whatsapp,alyssa vair,"Edited to include: I can't get notifications that I have messages . It literally pops up and says ""Popup notifications are no longer available in your version of Android"" Really?? What is going on with this app, does the app need an update to keep up with the new phones?? I have a Galaxy S22. Used to be a great app but I suddenly can't watch or send videos and their customer service sucks. I've cecked all my settings and they seem fine.... 🤯😖",2
com.whatsapp,Blaine C,Can't give this app more than a 3. It's definitely meant for transitory experiences and not keeping things longer term. You can export but not import chat histories. Restore from local database doesn't work. No way to keep messages if you somehow end up with them on multiple phones from say using a new number without merging accounts immediately. Sad situation for ppl who like memories. I would recommend Telegram or some other messaging app,3
com.whatsapp,Matt D,"Dog water app. Frustrating UI. Cannot properly sync contacts with phone contact list. Cannot verify account via email--phone only, which is very inconvenient. Each picture must be downloaded to the phone, taking internal space. Cannot log in on multiple devices as advertised. Calling is unreliable on WiFi and data. But hey, this is Meta, not sure why I expected a quality product.",1
com.whatsapp,Sophia de Gastelum,"WhatsApp has been amazing for me since I began using it in 2019. I've never had an issue with it....until last night. I can no longer send or receive messages. I went to the Help and Troubleshooting, I've done the suggestions ...still can't send or receive messages. I've checked for updates as well, my app is up to date. Is there a different suggestion or a fix for this issue? Thanks",5
com.whatsapp,jordan morris,"I have an issue with the call features. Every time im in a call, the screen needs to be on and the app needs to be open or the microphone wont work. I can hear the person im talking sometimes, but they cant hear me if I multi-task/open another app. If I put the phone screen to sleep, it cuts out. I have had this issue since the beginning of the year. Idk what I could be doing but that is the only issue. But its a big issue for be because I call alot.",1
com.whatsapp,Gil Cohen,"Used to be great, not anymore. WhatsApp does not recognize phone's media after the latest Android upgrade. This creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files. In addition, phone calls disconnect after a few minutes blaming the phone's microphone. And on top of that, their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time. So slow and useless. Such a big disappointment!",1
com.whatsapp,Edward Hammock,"Image attachments have stopped working. You can no longer type a message and insert an image. It has to be two separate messages. It also opens up a different gallery view to the normal one, meaning that you can only see the images already in what's app. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it is still not working. Please can this be resolved ASAP.",1
com.whatsapp,Yiliu Siow,"A couple of issues: 1. When selecting photos to be sent, it no longer shows the phone's gallery folders by default. Very inconvenient to have to access it through the 3 dots on top left hand corner. 2. Unable to select multiple photos to be sent at once. Extremely inconvenient. Please look into it and fix them. Thanks",2
com.whatsapp,Elnaz Moein,Since the last update the app doesn't allow you to send multiple pictures. You have to send them one by one which is frustrating and on top of that you no longer have access to your camera gallery. You have to go through multiple stupid annoying steps to try and find the pictures from your camera to send 1 by 1. This app has changed for the worst. It is now useless and garbage. So disappointing,1
com.whatsapp,Humarno Schoonwinkel,"Since the last update, the chat don't organize according to the date of messages. If one is to delete sone messages in a chat then the date of the last message is what it gets organized by. Since the update, the messages are organized since the last time there's been communication with that individual, even if you delete some un-important messages the chat doesn't get reorganized. Please fix this. The previous way helped a lot or at least give us the option to choose. Thank you for listening.",3
com.whatsapp,Diederick Muller,"i love this app, it's very reliable in my opinion, and it has good quality. I don't know what I'd do without it. I just wish there would be more features with the status viewing, where you can make different groups of people who can view your status, and also that you can see who viewed your status when your read receipts are off. I do however dislike the fact that we can't screenshot 1 view photos anymore.",3
com.whatsapp,Bilal Khan,"hi head WhatsApp is a very high and an easy means of communication. Through WhatsApp, people from all over the world are very close to each other, but sometimes there is a problem that is the problem of speaking the language, because one country is different from another country. I don't understand the language easily, there are many countries in it that the language is very strange, such as China, Japan, Indonesia, etc. Sir, I suggest you to use all language voice translator, call translator an",4
com.whatsapp,Ben,"As someone has already mentioned, the latest update has messed around with the gallery whilst sending photos. Yes, you can click the 3 dots in top right and find the main selection of photos but you cannot select more than one at a time now and making it a timely process. Seriously needs to go back to how it was. Please fix!",1
com.whatsapp,Robin Deacon,"Something has gone very wrong in the last update. When attaching photos, the Camera album is no longer accessible (only albums showing images from WhatsApp chats are visible, which is basically pointless). The workaround is to click the three dots, select 'gallery' and then choose 'camera'. This workaround only lets you select one image at a time though, and no video files are shown either! It's a complete pain. WhatsApp Devs, ease un-break this feature!",2
com.whatsapp,Malaz YI,"On Xiaomi mi A3, the app has 2 major problems: 1. Voice notes get sent empty after some random amount of time, force stopping the app and restarting usually solve, but it's super annoying, you be talking for minutes and boom the voice memo is silent! 2. When scrolling up in the chat, the chat glitches for a split of second and scolls itself up way higher than you'd expect it. Like I just wanted to see messages from yesterday, but suddenly I'm at the messages from 3 days ago!!!",1
com.whatsapp,Graeme Francis,"Ever since the last android update on my Samsung gs21, voice and video calls have issues with the sound breaking up. Occasionally it drops the call completely complaining about a microphone fault. There is nothing wrong with the mic. I've cleared the cache but that made no difference. App is currently unusable for calls which is totally infuriating!",2
com.whatsapp,LoW,"Recent update: an update. POP UP NOTIFICATIONS NOT AVAILABLE - I haven't been able to receive notifications on my phone unless I open the app, I am no longer able to turn this feature on at all. Help! Also, when I try to connect to bluetooth devices, my phone is connect to the bluetooth but whatsapp doesn't recognize this and remains on the normal/loud speaker.",3
com.whatsapp,Oxid Media,"used to be very reliable but since FB/Meta took over it's a buggy mess version upon version. lately I have lots of problems with audio clips. they're sometimes completely silent, and after sending one the whole thing bugs out and no further clips are sent. you're just there talking to yourself the whole time. furthermore opening the camera for in-chat pics or status updates locks the phone up until the app crashes. we don't need more features, we need the current feature set fail and foolproof",3
com.whatsapp,Lutfi Ice,"A simple and lightweight chat app. You can send images with reduced size or original size as you like, and almost any file with ease. The main concerns are: 1. Somehow I can't reply any status at all with newer versions. The reply box and enter button isn't shown by swiping up, is it a bug on tablet devices? 2. Please increase maximum pinned chats/groups. 3 is not enough. 3. Somehow there are random business accounts those chatted me for unknown reasons and unrelated to me. Is it a bot spam?",3
com.whatsapp,Ravshan Khudoyberdiev,"It is a terrible app. When you will have to switch from Android to iOS or vice verca you will understand what I mean. It will be impossible to move chats across and you will have to pay $30 to some weird software for this. Telegram doesn't have such problem since it is cloud based. Secondly, they limit account to 1 device when I have 4 phones that I use all the time. On Telegram you can add as many devices as you want.",1
com.whatsapp,David Raju,"I had a very good experience of using this application, and it's so useful for the person to have a conversation with the person who is far from us. just one suggestion you must add up the music in the story uploading so the people who wants to add music with photo or a video can be possible eaasily. Must do this change and update it soon, people will so happy to use it. Thank you very much.As a user of whatsapp , I have seen one of the new features I.e. poll selection. This feature is not so us",5
com.whatsapp,Penelope Sampson,"Nice app but unfortunately when I reinstalled the app due to a problem it was having, all the photos downloaded from WhatsApp to my phone gallery were erased, over 2000 photos and memories lost. I didnt have it backed up but I thought if photos were saved to my phone that meant they were saved. Apparently WhatsApp has the ability to erase photos from your phones photo gallery. This seems like a massive oversight in the way the app works, it should only be able to add photos to your phone.",1
com.whatsapp,G O C,"Update: Media Permissions had been revoked by Android 13 update. Working fine again. Lately, it's just unusable. Can't send videos or share anything as easily as I could. The Gallery only shows media I received, unless I go to a sub menu, which only displays photos. No videos. The main reason I use this app for.",5
com.whatsapp,Elizabeth Galary,"Before the update WhatsApp was amazing. Now, when I go to send pictures I can't. It only shows the pictures that I received from other WhatsApp chats. I then discovered that if I touch the 3 dots on the top right corner I can open my gallery, but I can only send one picture at a time and all of my videos are missing. I have to go to my gallery app to select a video and send it one at a time. PLEASE FIX!",2
com.whatsapp,sahil khan,"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in the last decade. All in one, from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way, WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in the near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing.",5
com.whatsapp,LoL XD,"Latest update wasn't good, the app does not recognize phone's media and instead only shows its own (which is useless when it comes to send recent pictures from phone's camera). Also because it needs several steps now just to send a recent picture/image from phone's gallery, it can only send one at a time, which is tiring as hell, and finally, it can't send videos from the phone's gallery, since the app only recognize pictures. Fix this garbage. This update is really inconvenient and pointless.",1
com.whatsapp,Juan Manuel Diana,"The worst messaging app. Lots of bugs, notifications arrive late, the chat backup works terrible and there seems not to be any intention to improve it, the audio quality when recording a voice message is quite inferior compared to other messaging apps... I don't understand why you don't solve all these problems that have been in the app for YEARS. Not even a thing is good in this app. DISASTER.",1
com.whatsapp,Hamza Khan,"Used to be great, not anymore WhatsApp does not recognize phone's media after the latest Android upgrade This creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files. In pddition, phone calls disconnect after few minutes blaming the phone's microphone. And on top of that, their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time. So slow and useless Such a big disappointment!",1
com.whatsapp,Владимир Федоров,"1) Constant backup issues. Now I have to use two copies of the app. 2) The app for Mac wants to update but it doesn't for some reason. And doesn't open either, so I use a web version instead. 3) Can't make a voice call quiet enough—even in the quietest mode it's too loud so that people in the same car can hear everything. There is no issue with that in other messengers. 4) And of course timeless classics—no way to use it on the laptop unless your phone has an active Internet connection.",1
com.whatsapp,Francois Fourie,"The latest update in Whatsapp is HORRIBLE! The whole gallery is meased up. Only certain images/videos pop up in ""recent files"" when you either want to send an image/video or upload a status. You cannot select multiple images to upload into status from gallery, so using your status update to market goods is taking way more time than usual. I am dissapointed and frustrated. This is NOT a functional update, it does NOT increase user experience in a good way!",1
com.whatsapp,Mohmd Rishal K,"Major issue faced is, after the recent update video calls automattically stops while talking. Especially while connected to a bluetooth device. It shows the ""microphone have issue please restart your phone"" but after that also the same problem is detected. It's very difficult to face a problem like these, from this application. And it's very uncomfortable for me to deal with these kind of BUG. Hope these problems will be solved.",3
com.whatsapp,Abha Kulkarni,"Keeps getting WORSE. I cannot view one-time photos, even though my Whatsapp is fully up-to-date. Even my system OS is up-to-date. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling WhatsApp to fix it but it ended up creating more problems - the ""Restoring Media"" has been stuck at 4% and it is doing absolutely nothing. WhatsApp developers - please help me and FIX all the bugs.",1
com.whatsapp,Gill K,"Like others have mentioned, ever since the latest Samsung update, I can no longer attach a photo from my camera gallery to a WhatsApp message, I can only access media that I've been sent on WhatsApp. My work around has been to attach a document and go to images, but the photo attaches as a jpeg - not ideal as I can not see the image of what I have sent. Please fix this WhatsApp!!",1
com.whatsapp,Shiny Luxray,"I really love this app! I use it to text all of my friends, and it makes it easier to identify that I have their correct number (because of the profile picture). Although, the call quality is really poor. Also, on video calls, I would like it to show nothing when I turn my camera off, instead of just a blurry screen. Maybe you could show it as a blank background with my pfp/profile picture on it? What I meant by poor quality is that I can barely hear my friends. The audio becomes glitchy.",3
com.whatsapp,Mumtaz Wali,"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use!",5
com.whatsapp,Daniel South,"Overall the best messaging app I've ever used, it's easy to use, free and uses WiFi to message, when connected. But I'd like it if you could make it so that if you call someone but they don't answer/decline they could leave a reason why they didn't answer/decline, and you could leave a reason why you called and vice versa. I'd also like it if you could make status videos longer, so like 1 min/1 min 30 sec instead of 30 sec. And you can send any type of video and it won't just say can't send. Thx",5
com.whatsapp,M Z,"Good messaging app. The fact that you can choose more than around five reactions is pretty great. What's still missing is the possibility to add more than one profile pic, which would be amazing since, the way I see it, it's usually not easy to abandon an image you've had for, let's say, months. Even a maximum of 5 would be enough. Apart from that, keep it up.",5
com.whatsapp,Amanda Coughlan,"I used to be able to send voice notes but now I cant. I can receive them and listen to them. When I press and hold the mic it just says recorder can not be set up right now try again later. This has been going on for over a year and no one has fixed it and say that it is a phone issue which it is not because voice recording works in every other app (Instagram, Snapchat etc) all permissions are granted, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times and cleared the cache. Very frustrating",1
com.whatsapp,mikhaela tiara,"I have a problem when I was calling through video calls. It's happening ti now since the recent updates. The problem is when I was on the video calls and then my camera is turned off accidently or not, the screen is turned on profile pictures (PP) instead of just a blurry screen like before. Honestly, if it's compared, I like more the previous ones than these recent updates. Please to whatsapp's team to FIX this. Because it's so annoying thing for me as a one of daily user of video call. Thanks",2
com.whatsapp,Jola Potentas,"It was great until I lost all my chats.. The app crashed 5 times in 4 months, each time it was struggling to restore backups and it would show no chat history. The last 3 times I somehow managed to restore it by, ironically, skipping the restore option.. I would lose a few days/weeks of messages. This time I've been trying for 2 weeks in different ways, following tips from others users experiencing the same issues, but it's not restoring the chats. I'm very disappointed and frustrated. Any tips?",1
com.whatsapp,Jen Shaw,"Been using for years. I've just got a new phone and can't have pop-up notifications on my lock screen - this is seemingly unavailable for Android 10 and newer, which is crazy! Why would it go backwards with a newer version? It's a real flaw, especially as my notifications are always on silent and I usually just glance at my lock screen to check. Everything else still has pop-ups so WhatsApp is the only one - come on IT folk, get your act together! Pretty please.... 😉",4
com.whatsapp,Andrea Gyopár Nagy,What on earth is going on with this app? It worked perfect until the last update. Now when I'm trying to attach a photo from my phone it's only showing the photos between me and that specific contact. If I want to attach a video it wont even appear at all. If I want to attach multiple photos I actually have to go into my photos app and share from there to WhatsApp. Like it's completely the opposite of user friendly right now.,1
com.whatsapp,Kay Zarei,"All videos send without audio constantly since android update. New update so far has been awful, please fix bugs. Deleting last message doesn't move contact down the list they stay right at the top, also harder to access gallery photos and only able to send 1 at a time. Quality has dropped quite a lot. Notifications have also reset somehow.",1
com.whatsapp,Helder Diego Câmara,"I was forced to update the app to latest version. That's bad. Frequent crashes when using it with wireless earbuds during the call. The main problem is for sure we can't listen to de Voice notes in private way, I don't wanna listen to my audios through the speaker! Added to this, keeps the screen on causing accidently touches. Summary: used to be really good, currently is very poor.",1
com.whatsapp,Pie Face,Would be good if you could add location to pics/videos shared on Status. And have Live video sharing on Status. Also Why does it have to have 'contacts to invite' under your list of contacts. Very annoying if you want to quickly scroll to the end of your contacts to now have all these random numbers that you would never invite. Some are just short codes listed not even proper numbers. Very annoying and messy looking,3
com.whatsapp,Gail Dear,"Like a few people have mentioned, since the last update, I am not able to attach photos from within WhatsApp. I have to come out of WhatsApp and go to my photo gallery and attach photos from there. Which is really annoying and time consuming. It was much easier before. Can this feature be restored please.",3
com.whatsapp,Joshua Okoro,"After the most recent update, every time the app is not visibly open on my phone, notifications would not come in until I open the app and everything shows up, I've checked background data settings on my phone and everything is intact, this has happened to me twice and always after an update. I really hope this could be fixed immediately. It's very disturbing.",2
com.whatsapp,Philip Ade,"As much as I like the app, since I was forced to update few days ago, it's been the worst app ever as i no longer get notifications for messages. Even when calls come in i only hear it ring so i have to open the app to see who is calling and also be able to pick the call. This is crazy at this point. Please fix this quickly it's no longer funny at all. Thanks",2
com.whatsapp,Jay-Dee Hermanus,Samsung S20FE Please fix the notification glitch. They either show and don't go away after reading messages/backup is complete or they don't show at all. Messages/calls also don't come through/deliver when I'm not in the app (even on WIFI). I've missed some time sensitive communications due to this. PLEASE FIX Phone is set to show all notifications.,1
com.whatsapp,Aster Dcosta,"The app was working fine until the recent update. When you call a person via Bluetooth headset, it connects your call to the receiver. But the receiver can't hear your voice. But can hear you when then receiver calls you themselves. Also the quick message notification feature doesn't deliver texts properly, with the sender not receiving the texts unless one opens the app. Please fix this issue as I think it is related due to some bug.",2
com.whatsapp,Olubiyi Oyetola,The issue I have is the notification. There is no more pop up messages anymore. It makes me loose so much messages to read and replied on time. Even calls don't appear again except through sound which I have to go to the app before seeing the call. This really affecting. Pls fix! Especially the pop up.,1
com.whatsapp,Muhammad Zubair,"This is OnePlus phone. On WhatsApp only, the sensors don't work right. I cannot listen to a voice note with my phone at my ear because sometimes it will switch to ear and at other times not. Similarly, it will not switch back from ear and it becomes impossible to switch back from ear before the voice note/call ends (the screen stays off meanwhile).",1
com.whatsapp,Nidhin Suresh,"IMPORTANT PROBLEM TO FIX:- The App was fine until the recent update. After that, while doing a video call especially via Bluetooth headset, the call is getting disconnected automatically. The mic and audio during the call also gets canceled at sometimes. It's been a real headache, since i was regularly using whatsapp video calls. A lot of people are facing this same problem after the recent update. Please fix this glitch in the next update and provide it as soon as possible. FIX IT SOON. IMP‼",1
com.whatsapp,Thaomy Nguyen,"I (and others, clearly) have experienced troubles with attaching media from my gallery since last update: it does not recognize my own media and doesn't show it as a option when I try to select. Instead I need to take a detour ( ... option upper right corner) and even then I can only select 1 file at the time. It's a huge hassle",2
com.whatsapp,Vincent Zothankima,"Two missing stars bcoz of 2 cons. 1. No customizable timer in ""Disappearing message"". At least add ""3 days"", please. 2. It would be nice to be able to turn off/pause the app's access to net quickly and easily, and without having to tinker with phone's settings. I don't even know if i can block net access in phone's setting. One would need too many tappings anyhow. Everything else is good..",3
com.whatsapp,Rashawn Diallo,"Won't allow me to send messages to existing contacts anymore on the 2nd installed version on my Samsung phones. I can't find anyone on the 2nd app unless I unistall, delete data, reinstall and re-verify numbers again, switching back and forth. The primary app reads contacts. The 2nd one won't. Terrible if you use multiple numbers like me.",1
com.whatsapp,Bint E Zehra,It is a great place to use chat services. However I'm a bit annoyed with its privacy features. I don't want any random contact outside my contact list to message and call me but I don't have that settings. It becomes annoying to receive calls and messages on Whatsapp from random contacts. I hope there's a way to block this unnecessary traffic. Also I cannot report suspicious numbers.,1
com.whatsapp,Scarlett Messenger,"What a miserable user experience. I can no longer attach more than one image from my gallery, it can't find most of the images on my phone for some reason, the backup function stopped working months ago, and good luck finding answers or getting support. Another helpful product ruined by greed and laziness.",1
com.whatsapp,Jasmine Clarke,"Why only a 3 star rating, when it is one of the dominant messaging apps? Because it isn't secure, irrespective of the end to end encryption it claims to employ. It is great that only admins can see certain changes, but admins should decide if a group needs disappearing messages or not. Indeed, it should not be possible for a hacker to take over another person's account !! I have received messages from people who didn't send them, many times...this is an identity issue and needs to be fixed ASAP",3
com.whatsapp,KULSHUMA HAQUE,"Over the last few months, this app has been the worst! It's so annoying, because I would use this app as my main source of communication with others. However, recently my messages just stop sending and video/voice calls are bad quality. The app doesn't work and it looks like it's because of network issues, but it's only that app that stops working!",1
com.whatsapp,Emma Ryan,Recently annoying. Every day for last 4 days it's constantly trying to backup and failing at 98%. I've tried turning backup off and it's still attempting it. I've restarted my phone. I've deleted some chats to reduce what it has to backup. Nothing works. There's plenty of storage space. I've just tried uninstalling and downloading the app again. Let's see if that works....... it didn't........,2
com.whatsapp,Paul Pociask,"It's great app in general. It worked perfect until the last update. Now when l'm trying to attach a photo from my phone it`s only shows the WhatsApp photos, won't show camera gallery photos or screenshots . Now to attach multiple photos I actually have to go into my photos app and share to WhatsApp. Update, Fixed - Ther reason for not being able to send pictures from the camera folder is because update removed permissions for ""photos videos"" just go to app settings and add permission.",3
com.whatsapp,Carline Askew,"WhatsApp backup and restore option is trash. I spent days backing up my information such as chats, pictures and etc, on my old phone, to be able to restore on my new phone. Even though, it appears to back it up, it did not. I've worked so hard and was extremely patient still nothing after multiple attempts, I gave up. This app is a fraud. Backup and restore data should be one of the top priority for WhatsApp.",1
com.whatsapp,Sushil Chavan,"A lot of important work remains to be done. Like view delete messages, hide personal messages, lock personal messages, put gift cover page on top of messages (like Instagram). Edit option, The world is moving a lot, man, a lot of changes should be made today. I agree the app is good. But how to hold on to the same thing for a long time. Change is human development. Live not ahead but at least live with. I think messages can be sent from anywhere. So I didn't like this app very much.",1
com.whatsapp,Coconut Palm,"Can't screenshot 'view once' media anymore. This is really silly as my friends use 'view once' to send things without using storage on our devices (since WhatsApps saves everything locally) so if the receiver wants to save it, they just screenshot it. How about just giving the sender a warning that it was screenshotted?? Big tech needs to stop forcing us to do what THEY think is right for US. If you send things online then assume that they'll be saved (take responsibility for your actions!)",1
com.whatsapp,Naomi Maxwell,"I was having the same issue when attaching photos to send. I fixed this by going into phone settings, apps, WhatsApp and changing permissions. Photos and videos was in the 'not allowed' permissions. Change this to 'allowed' and it should fix the issue. I had to allow audio and music when i did this.",2
com.whatsapp,Alessandria L,"Sending photo function is totally fussy! Nowadays click on the camera icon to select photos will only show the photos that already been sent in WhatsApp but not the ones in any other folders in the gallery, esp the latest pics! Plus, been directing to the gallery which show the camera folder, it will only allow you to send one photo even though you choose to add photo, the last added photo is the only one you can send, totally nuisance! What happen to the setting here!",3
com.whatsapp,Amit Lodhia,"Support is poor. After I upgraded my phone to Android 13, WhatsApp has an issue with video calls where the sound cuts out for me and the recipient. When I end the call and close WhatsApp, the microphone indicator shows that WhatsApp is still using the microphone and I have to specifically disable the microphone to stop it. I tried uninstalling the app, and reinstalling. Still happens. I wiped the partition cache of my phone. Still happens. I have contacted WhatsApp support, no help so far!",1
com.whatsapp,majula Deesthree,"Wow this app is the best thing that a person could have but there is this one issue that I think happens to other people but I'm not sure but anyways like we all love voice messages right? So when I try to use it and when I send it for some reason the voice message shows 1 sec and when u tap on it, it doesn't work and it won't say anything about what I said but please fix this issue because if I wanna type a long message but then I don't wanna type so I can use voice message so please fix this😭",3
com.whatsapp,mel bsk,"Been using WhatsApp for years now, and it's my first time facing any inconvenience at all. I don't get notified for my calls because it is “silenced by Do Not Disturb”. I don't recall turning such a thing on, and I tried everything to solve this but failed even though the app has permission for calls and notification. This is really frustrating, so it would be great if someone can tell me how to fix this. Thank you.",2
com.whatsapp,Queen Ashfaidhy,"After the most recent update, every time the app is not visibly open on my phone, notifications would not come in until I open the app and everything shows up I've checked background data settings on my phone and everything is intact, this has happened to me twice and always after an update. I really hope this could be fixed immediately. It's very disturbing",3
com.whatsapp,Yuki Desouza,"This app wouldn't be so bad if it didn't insist on taking over every aspect of your phone. I linked my contacts for one minute and now my contacts' photos won't show up, even after I've unlinked them. Whatsapp is a horrendous disease for your phone, I'd recommend using a real social media app for texts and calls instead.",1
com.whatsapp,William Anton,"Great app! Could you please add a checkbox for those who use cellular data under international roaming? I noticed that my phone does not perform a backup once the checkbox for cellular data is selected, mainly because I am using roaming all the time. In this case, it is only working when using wifi connection. Thanks!",5
com.whatsapp,ADITYEY SINGH,"Whatsapp is the best official apk for sharing photos, videos, documents and much more. It gives you complete security when you talk with someone. It's video call and phone calls are really good because you can make a call from one country to another country without any cost (only mobile data required). You can chat secure, call secure and a lot of things are secured 🛡️",5
com.whatsapp,Jennie Bean,"After new samsung update, my photos wouldnt show. If youre having the same issue, go to the device settings, apps and permissions. My photos and video permissions was unchecked (was checked before the update). Allow permissions for photos and videos again. It should sort the issue out. Hope this helps a few people.",5
com.whatsapp,Ashish Tiwari,"It is a best messaging and photo , video sharing software. But I think audio recording and video calling recording feature should be add in it while calling.although you all are upgrading it and adding some of the advance feature. Keep upgrading by which a user could get a better experience and don't face any types of problems while using it. I would like to thank all of your team members of the company who are doing hardwork with honesty 🙏 . Still My experience is good to use it. 🇮🇳",4
com.whatsapp,Onyii Amakam,"I really love this app...And the improvement and upgrades made on it. It's really get more interesting....🤗🤗. If you don't mind, I would like to suggest that some more features be added to it.... Such as video record, where one can drop a face recording of him/herself jxt as we drop voice recordings...I guess this type of feature exist in telegram.... Thanks 🤗🤗",5
com.whatsapp,Soumalika Basu,"Restoration of the backup process is full of glitches which can easily cause you to lose access to all your backed up chats, media, etc. Customer care is non existent when it comes to any solving issues. Automated messages are the most you can get out of them. For such a widely used app, this is extremely frustrating and disappointing.",1
com.whatsapp,titiz Costa,"Great App! There's just sometimes some glietiches but overall great! But i suggest that on status we can make them so only certain people can see, so of I'm making a surprise party, I'll make a status about it and put only the people that are going to be in it, in it! Another one, i think it would be fun to go live on WatsApp! The people on your chats can join and see! I would also like that i can record videos without pushing the button all the time but instead you click on it to make a video!",3
com.whatsapp,Hannan Zahra,"good app, all messages can be sent and calls can be answered perfectly fine. although, i really wish for status they could add settings. it would be much better if we could customize the fonts, how big and small it is, and so much more possibilities. with each update the size of the fonts keep changing, it was so good before, small just to my liking but now its way too big. i know for some people they would prefer big fonts, but i would prefer small ones.",3
com.whatsapp,Shashank mishra,"First of all app is awesome but need to update on Status Bar. For example some one wants to upload a video message to on Status,if he/she wants to share video which is more than 3minutes. So he/she have to post for 6times(30 second) that is very annoying. Update on Status bar,so we will post the video of more than 30 seconds in one time only. That will be very helpful for all of us.",4
com.whatsapp,Shubham Varun,"As a user of WhatsApp , I have seen one of the new feature i.e. Poll Selection . This feature is not so useful. One can change their option as per the majority of voters . This feature is useless . It's is not baised at all. Another thing is we can select both of the option at same it . It's the major drawback of this Poll Feature . Not accurate as well as trustable at all . According to me , you should modify this feature so that it'll be helpful for others.",1
com.whatsapp,Maya Sharma,"Good alternative for Messages, so you can chat cross platform, with read receipts, stickers, and actually somewhat decent quality video. Some changes would be suggested though. Most important feature missing, can't be singed in on two phones (or a phone and tablet) at once, unlike ¡Message. Also could better image and video quality shared.",4
com.whatsapp,Dolev Levavi,"""Something went wrong with your chat history..."" This happens to me daily for monthes now, daily! It is such a bother!! The 2 AM backup triggers this everyday, plus, sometimes it'll also accure seemingly at random throughout the day. Worst thing is, the restoration is not working properly and I have to guess when to force close it and hope to not lose days of my chat history. Many times I do lose several days and have to resort to reinstalling the app which causes of course the loss of settings",1
com.whatsapp,Jai Starr,"Since I had a recent update, the replacement WhatsApp keyboard has changed and there's no carriage return. You cannot have paragraphs any longer. Like what I'm doing. What are the developers thinking!!!! Derrrrrr Put back the original authentic qwerty keyboard with a carriage return, as opposed to this rediculas new send button replacing the carriage return. It is now a send button. How many send buttons does it need to have one, NOT two. It is a ZERO star for me.",1
com.whatsapp,Poetic J,"Edit: I take back my 3 * - I can't even post a photo status, it shows up blurry to others! Usually would be a 5 * but like so many others have said, since the latest update, the gallery attachments don't work properly now with android (Samsung) & now not even photo status. Previously couldn't send edited videos with sound. Why do these things keep happening?! Can this get fixed please WhatsApp?",1
com.whatsapp,Kepo Pisimi,"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in last decade. All in one , from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way , WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing team.........",5
com.whatsapp,Erwin Steiner,"Local Backup doesn't work at all. Lost all my chat history because there is no option to simply tell Whatsapp where to find the backup file. It should be found automatically but it dosen't. Being a Software developer I'm pretty sure it's not my fault. But never mind, mostly switched to Signal anyway. Due to other reasons like data security and so on...",1
com.whatsapp,Marcelita Dlugosova,"I love WA but lately, I would dare say already months, I don't get any notifications unless I am right in the app. Calls are simply not ringing and often noticed after couple of hours like a ""missed call notifications""! It's very very inconvenient and I would vote for some fixing before I will be forced to swap my favourite chatting and calling tool. Thanks for taking into consideration!",2
com.whatsapp,Fatin Abdulrazzak,It is very annoying that some media can't be sent to more than one person at a time if it was forwarded too many times. This doesn't make any sense. It is an app to share thing with friends. What's the point in making restrictions. Another annoying thing is that some of the sent media doesn't load and that's very frequent and it's happening too often with so many poeple. That wasn't the case before.,3
com.whatsapp,Jai Shree Vohra,The recent update is the worst. Now you can't see all albums from phone on WhatsApp. Broadcast lists don't work (you can't find any pictures). The gallery is not available on one click and when you do go to the actual gallery you can select just one picture. Useless. Useless Useless,1
com.whatsapp,Lou Brown,"I am having problems with not getting notifications through, it doest show on the icon that have unread messages. If you can help please tell me what is going on? I have made sure all my apps are up to date, I am getting other notifications, all the settings seem to be set correctly and still not working.",4
com.whatsapp,Aakarsh Garg,"Good cross-platform alternative for Messages. Some changes would be suggested though. Feature missing, can't be singed in on two phones at once, unlike iMessage. Also could better image and video quality shared. Biggest drawback: doesn't use cloud storage (Telegram and Discord have implemented it). WhatsApp eventually takes up 10 GB on my phone and only option is to delete messages.",3
com.whatsapp,Princess Ezeuzoh,"Still much space needed that one has to dedicate all storage space in the phone and the forceful upgrade of the App is very annoying, even when one is not ready to upgrade. So frustrating. One should upgrade when one is ready to create the space. Imagine 292mb for this App upgrade! A very convenient and handy App. Great in all ramification except in data and storage consumption. Awesome indeed, very useful and almost indispensible and so easy to use!!! Consider blocking group than exiting.",4
com.whatsapp,Alexa C,"What on earth is going on? Half of the notification settings have been removed and what is available doesn't work. I turned the group notifications off yet still my phone has been blowing up since half 5, it's currently half 9. I used to be able to select who I can get notifications from specifically, that option has also gone. Pls stop changing things that make the application redundant. Thanks.",3
com.whatsapp,Himanshu Sahu,Overall it's one of the best messaging app. It's too smooth and gives best experience in conversation. But 1 thing which it should have and will be very appreciating is auto-splitting of complete video in parts while uploading status. If it can upload a complete video in parts of 30sec than it will be very good as it will not break the continuity of the video.,4
com.whatsapp,Ines Pernar,"I keep missing video chats because the phone doesn't ring. It's been happening for over a month now. Used to think that it had something to do with my phone, but the persons phone I'm calling also didn't ring, only notification shows up. Edit: Lately video chats are impossible because of the noise, everytime I say something, this terrible noise appears. It's so bad that it makes video chat impossible so we switched to another app. Please fix this noise.",1
com.whatsapp,Shamila Lethabo Adegboye,"The app's mostly fine. My biggest issue is that when I want to upload a video that's longer than 30 seconds and I trim it let's say somewhere in the centre, whatsapp does not save the trimmed part but instead, sends the first 30 seconds. As such, I'm always forced to use a video editor (InShot) and then forward to my WhatsApp status from there. Finally, please stop with butchering image and video quality; at least make it an option instead of forcefully compressing size and quality. It sucks!",3
com.whatsapp,D,"There are only a few things missing that would make me give this app a 5-star rating. Other apps let users respond to a message in a group via a collapsible thread. That would improve group chats in a big way to save space, because I know some people are annoyed by lots of text. Also, it would be great if sent messages could also be edited instead of just deleted. I have asked about this last part before. Editing saves time instead of deleting and typing over again. Apps like Telegram do it.",3
com.whatsapp,B L,"Oh dear! It's not sending messages, despite amazing internet connection. It's generally a good app. But rather than say memory too low it just removes some of my chat before I can back it up. Really upset ☹️ no reply from app. Also why is the video editor bit next to the back option. Stupid really as it loses the video if you go out by a millimetre.",1
com.whatsapp,Blue Diamond,"I love WhatsApp cz its easy to use & has many great features. But i recently installed dual WhatsApp and i noticed that not a single media shows up in my gallery or storage. I need to manually click on each photo/video and upload it to Google photos only then can I see them in my gallery.I have media visibility on, i have selected all media even for mobile data, restarted my phone and much more but nothing seems to work apart from manually uploading them on Google photos. Pls fix this.",4
com.whatsapp,J Chaudhry,"Good app, but what I dislike the most is that anyone who gets hold of your phone number can see that you have Whatsapp installed. It needs to change. If anyone wants to add you, the invitation should go through text message and only after you accept they should be able to see you on whatsapp. Also under privacy settings for last see, photo, and about, there should be an option for 'Only these contacts' so that any new contact you add will not automatically see it unless you include them.",3
com.whatsapp,Sanjida Akther,Great app indeed. But would like to suggest to add some new features. It would be amazing if there's an option to turn off online status so that when you're on WhatsApp others can't see it. The option should be customizable for certain people just like the status option provides. Last seen option should also have the exact same facility. Happy chitchatting guys!,4
com.whatsapp,Tioluwani Ogunnika,"It's been a good experience, please consider the following features as additions to the app. Deactivating autoplay/loading of status videos and pictures, activate a 'do not receive status update' for a specific period, clearing already received status, pinning or having favourites status updates. Hoping to see some of these features, if not all in the near future. Thank you",4
com.whatsapp,Bourne Vexed,Keeps telling me I need an internet connection when I already have one. This plus the other issues that most of us have already complained about which don't get fixed renders the app pretty damn useless at the best of times. Had to give it a star to write the review. Doesn't give the option to restore from backup lost all chats absolute shi*e. Won't be using it again. Was once a great app. Sick of all the issues.,1
com.whatsapp,linzi a,"Cannot see or download pictures or videos keeps giving error message. Plus when pictures are sent they cannot be seen they are just blurred out! The app crashes allot more since updates recently! And now the call quality is worse than before, sometimes can hardly use calls it just doesn't want to work! This used to be such a good application! But not just problematic sadly! I really wishe these glitches would be fixed",1
com.whatsapp,GR,"Messed up. 😡 They left everyone (even landline & toll-free numbers) in your Whatsapp phone book with an ""Invite a Friend"" link for each entry in your phonebook--Even if already listed as whatsapp users. Now cluttering the whatsapp contact list with this USELESS feature in the send a message screen. NO WAY to hide/remove. It's obvious the developers/owners are trying hard to get you to invite everyone to use whatsapp. Don't bother asking for help. Their auto responses don't help either. 👎",1
com.whatsapp,Jessica Newcombe,WhatsApp is a great way to communicate but it all comes down to when u start voice or video calls and your on WiFi but when your off WiFi and using your data it's perfectly fine. But when you use WiFi it always crashes and WhatsApp is down for no less than 2 hours. It's a joke!!! It's not just my WiFi or my phone either. I have tried multiple phones and WiFi and it still dose the same thing. I would not recommend this as most people like to call instead of text each other.,1
com.whatsapp,Emilia K,"This app is really annoying as: it doesnt notify me of messages half of the time and sometimes i don't get them (even thought my wifi is on and is very good) unless i literally have the app open allllll the time. And whenever i'm on call, after a while, it just starts cutting out and the call ends and needs restarting. Why?? Also, why do my reviews keep disappearing? So stupid",2
com.whatsapp,Nahida Kousar,"Worst app!!! I tried the new feature end-to-end encryption password on chat backup, but while trying to restore the chat backup, whenever i enter the password everytime it shows ""something went wrong please try again later"". I contacted WhatsApp and sent a mail along with screenshot but got no solutio. Why you introduced this feature when you have no solution to this problem.",1
com.whatsapp,Melanie Lowe,"Why is there no way to contact support? I can't get into personal WhatsApp or business. Both say no connection, try again, but it never happens. I can't access WhatsApp at all. I've been using the same phone number for the last 22 years. I've rebooted, uninstalled, reinstalled. My internet is working for everything but WhatsApp and I've tried to send a message on your website, but after filling it all in, there is NO button visible to actually send it, on phone OR laptop.",2
com.whatsapp,Goh Siping,"From bad to worst after the update. All files that wanting to share and send have to go to the most troublesome ways by going to files and select it 1 by 1. The camera taking through whatsapp is still blurry compare to taking pictures using camera app, and also the delay even at the best network area. Also this problem has always occurs everytime when there's a big update.",1
com.whatsapp,CA Rajesh Pabari,"The back up on google drive never gets completed. Suddenly in the morning something goes wrong with data, as it says on the screen. Whatsapp tries to restore and it does restore a month old data. Why in the world there are multiple everyday versions are being stored in the internal memory of phone? What's the fuss? Can someone explain?",1
com.whatsapp,Katze Root,"I'd give it negative stars if I could. An absolute HORRENDOUS app. Whenever I take a picture it takes a whole year to load it (and it's far from being my phone's issue), when I send 2 or more pictures to someone it kicks me back to the picture picker even if the photos still send, and the PC app on the Windows Store is absolute dogwater. It is so unstable it's not even funny. It's just sad.",1
com.whatsapp,Info,"I don't see why if you don't have the newest version of a phone you need to sacrifice receiving notifications. Twice now this app has stopped allowing me to receive notifications, claiming that the option is no longer available on my version of Android. Getting a new phone fixed it at first but that's not going to be an ongoing occurrence.",1
com.whatsapp,Gabriella Basi,"It's a great app and it worked perfectly fine for years UNTIL a few months ago when a lot of the time when I try to open WhatsApp, it lags SO much and takes like 10 minutes to open properly and send a message. I know for a fact that this has nothing to do with my phone in general because every other app on my phone works smoothly, and because a few other people I know have the exact same issue as I do, and the rest of their phone is working fine too. Thanks❤️",2
com.whatsapp,Cindy,"After an update, the whatsapp web really delayed. I can't view my previous message, document, links like before. And in my phone, it really not friendly user anymore. When i want to upload my picture , i can't attach it many in the same time. And i need to click it one by one. Please fix this. I prefer the older version of this whatsapp app.",1
com.whatsapp,Shaf Ahmed,"Hey Whatsapp Developer Team, The app is fantastic as the numbers and ratings already tell. I just wish there should be a way to turn off Whatsapp even when you are connected to internet, you are unable to receive messages until you turn it back on. Like a log in log off button without the hassle of adding credentials. Just a toggle button to either receive or not receive messages no matter you are connected to internet or not. Looking forward to such update soon. Other than that its awesome.",4
com.whatsapp,Naufal,"Completely exasperating experience with the backup and restore system. Neither the google drive nor the local backup able to get restored on the new phone. Not to forget the exhausting verification security system since I had to go back and forth just to get the chat restore working, which ultimately isn't. Media files are safe but had to manually copy and paste them to other places other than a phone.",1
com.whatsapp,Party Quest,"You touching things you're not supposed to. What I mean by that, is you touched something that wasn't supposed to be broken but you broke it. Listening to a 15 minutes message then replying to it and then trying to resume it where you left off, the message starts all over again and you cannot skip forward meaning you have to listen to 10 minutes of the same message to be able to finish the last 5 minutes really terrible.",3
com.whatsapp,randomitaliano,"Great app for texting. However the biggest issue is backing up the messages. Can't neither backup nor restore messages while roaming and having no wifi around. Wish I could log in on to my new phone and have all my messages on the ready like Facebook Messenger, without having to worry if I have backed up my messages from my old phone. Also, logging in seems to be a struggle as you might get send verification code to your number and never get it, as you might not have phone signal.",2
com.whatsapp,J D,"As much as I like, and use this app daily; I have one niggle, when on a video call. I have a z flip 3, and it automatically goes into split screen if I flip it up!

com.whatsapp,Dia Sheikh,"Quite recently, I'm facing an issue with the Online Status of my contacts. If I'm chatting with a friend, they are NOT shown online but as soon as they start typing, the typing status is shown. Same is true for recording audios. Problem is only with the Online status. Why is that happening? Kindly resolve this issue and I'll update my review to 5 stars. Thanks!",4
com.whatsapp,Idel Tanessok,"1)When posting a video on status, the video sometimes is not sync with its own sound which is very annoying. 2)When I select a large video for my status, it takes alot of time before loading. it's very borring please try fixing that. Maybe the app is trying to compress it. 3)Adding a way to separate group chats from other conversations will make the chat page less choked when there are many messages. Please try fixing it.",3
com.whatsapp,jonathan cohen,"I he options appeared without Audio. I tried the Photo/Video button and changed file type to All. I sent, but at the other end the ""Unable to complete download"" message WhatsApp on both my laptop and mobile. I had an issue with the Web version on my laptop. I had to send voice files that I made, to a group. When I clicked Attach , only five appeared. Eventually, I sent the voice files by mail to my phone and then sent them successfully by WhatsApp. Why no Audio button on Web?If poss please fix.",4
com.whatsapp,Lohkay,"This app is terrible, at first it was working perfectly fine until the app literally stopped being useable. Any time i tried to call someone? Black screen and the app would stop responding. Any time i tried to listen to a voicemail? App stops responding. Redownloaded many times to try and fix these issues but they kept happening. Dont download it, its garbage.",1
com.whatsapp,himanshu sharma,The app is good. Constantly improving and adding new features to it. WhatsApp may think to add a feature where a sender can send a message in an encrypted or in locked form which a receiver may unlock after a due date or on happening of certain event or after putting a password shared by the sender. This feature will help the people to convey their feelings or emotions on real time basis which they don't want the receiver to know right now right away. Looking forward to it.,4
com.whatsapp,Joseph Matimba,The latest update has RUINED the text status feature. Before the update the text would change size gradually from big to small depending on how much text was used. Now the text just drops to a very small font even with just 10 words. What's the point of text statuses if we have to squint to see them?,1
com.whatsapp,Oluchi Ogwuegbu,"The app keeps crashing. I have tried to install the latest update, this did not help. And there is no option to downgrade to previous update. Can't open, click on or respond to new messages. Or view /click old messages. Error message ""WhatsApp is not responding"".

com.whatsapp,Artur G,"Has become frustrating. Why cant I attach multiple images to messages anymore? Also, when selecting the gallery from the message attachments, the first thing that opens up is Whatsapp images folder, not my phone albums, which is annoying. Why break something that was working?? I contacted support about this and the only thing it replied was that Im probably using an unofficial whatsapp app, which is ridiculous. I'd give 0 stars if it'd be possible.",1
com.whatsapp,Umesh Babu J,As the app working is good but only one defect was found that when we delete a person message then after chat list was not showing based on the date list. It is showing the deleted person contact as a top list.previously when we delete anessage from one contact it will be removed and sorted based on the date of conversation now it's not working in Android users. Thank you,1
com.whatsapp,Ama Badu,"New community feature is terrible. It's not useful for 99.99% of users. I thought it's up to me alone to control it. But when I used it, it merged ALL contacts in the 2 groups that I added to the Community!!! Without prior notice and it notified everybody in those groups! As a result, some people left, because you can't use their numbers to merge in same community WITHOUT ASKING THEM! I was ashamed of what the What's App did.",3
com.whatsapp,Charith Dissanayake,"Biggest problem is that the more media you have in the chat, more time it takes to load media/files section. Telegram loads it almost instantaneously. Also it would be nice to store (encrypted) media on the cloud storage without consuming storage space on the phone. Also have Issues with chat not automatically scrolling down, and suddenly jumping way up when scrolling up.",1
com.whatsapp,sathyapramod belgaumkar,"The application was good until the recent update.. after updating, the new feature called ""Message yourself"" is actually not working properly and whenever i text myself and delete the texts, at the same time the display picture getting disappeared. I checked for several times and it's happened again n again. Kindly fix this issue.",2
com.whatsapp,WOBNIAR G,"This is helpful to contact people you want to contact yourself but is also unhelpful in the sense that it won't even let you send a message to someone without requiring access to your phone contacts. If I want to add them from my phone, I will, I don't need WhatsApp making it so that the option is forced out of my control.",3
com.whatsapp,Adrian Sándor,"Usually works fine for chatting, buy I hate that it's tied to a phone, fully proprietary, and somewhat crippled when not giving it the invasive permissions it requests (such as contacts). Also transferring chat history to a new phone is an absolute nightmare, doesn't work, and restore only happens when reinstalling, which has horrible timeouts for the verification code.",1
com.whatsapp,arolyo,Used to be good and the tech support is 10th rate. About 3 updates ago they managed to break a perfectly good app. The ability to send video stopped working with an unable to send video error message. To compound this none of my messages to tech support have born any fruit and have to explain the fault every songle time. Months later it still doesn't work. I now absolutely dread these mandatory updates.,1
com.whatsapp,Mona,"Good app. Works well for me. 12/01/22 update: since the last 2 updates I now have issues with notifications. Sometimes I get notified of new messages, sometimes I don't! Very frustrating! 🤨. I have to constantly go to the app to see if I've gotten any new messages.",4
com.whatsapp,Quiana Wiltink,"Worst update ever. I can't send videos from my gallery anymore and when you want to send pictures from your gallery you have click on the three dots and go to your gallery separately instead of having acces to it immediately when you click on ""gallery"" in the chat.

com.whatsapp,Aiden Mertin,"Generally great, use it as my preferred way to communicate with friends and family, but do have a couple of complaints: 1.

If we talk in a full video call like in a video call, then I can put my own video of any other video call there, But since this is your last update problem happen",3
com.whatsapp,Anthony Ezeh,"It's been a beautiful experience, but do something about the Media compression when uploading.

com.whatsapp,Brendan Chew,"Backup needs improvement, backing up either encrypted or not, takes HOURS. I will sit by my router literally for best connectivity with 1 Gbps fiber line and still take hours. I think a main initial 11gb backup is ok, but every subsequent backup take just as long.

com.whatsapp,Shailendra Chaudhari,"It is the best application to work with, we can chat , talk to anyone .You can add status so that everyone can have a look for the picture for a special events. I 'd love to say that this is the best application to talk,chat with anyone . You can even send sticker , emojis , gif . You can make video calls and send images , files ,ppt , exel etc.. I think it's the best ..........",5
com.whatsapp,Shreya Srivastava,It's a good app. But i think it must need some new salient features such as a Like❤ option on a status like an Instagram which may be helpful for the people who don't use Instagram. Through this they can show their feelings towards that people whom they like the most. Through this option the people who don't talk to each other due to shyness but they like each other can share their feelings. So i think the whatsapp should add this feature for making it more worthy.👍👍,3
com.whatsapp,Chris Rutter,"As mentioned previously, the latest issue now prevents the user from directly attaching photos taken with the camera.

Needs fixed!",1
com.whatsapp,Winston Mwamande,"User friendly. Simple but effective. I really like this app, one of the best ways to keep in touch with friends and family.

Of you do a Google search on the topic HUNDREDS of articles are written on it. Meaning it's been an issue, and for so long that hundreds of people wrote about how they fixed it.

For example it glitches and doesnt show if my message have been delivered unless i close the chat and re open it. Or if i'm on a call and the person doesn't respond and i call back, the camera freezes and it unfreezes unless i close the call. Each of your ""updates"" are just downgrades. Really disappointed of how WhatsApp have turned into. What is the use of this community thing? Why does my photos/videos compresses each time i send it?",2
com.whatsapp,Nermeen Emaduddin,LATEST UPDATE IS TERRIBLE. this is my worst experience since I've started using WhatsApp. it's been so bugged ever since the latest update; messages be sent and still be marked as 'unsent'.

Not sure if it's a Samsung or whatsapp glitch. I am messaging with a rep but feel it's a robotic rep. Added: I figured out the issue! I had to open permissions and go to whatsapp and add photos and videos""",2
com.whatsapp,Khalid Mehmood Arain,Overall the app is good and excellent. But now there is a time to insert some new and advance features like to have some password or pattern or fingerprint on some person chat or group setting will have also to be updated to have the lock 🔒 features. please make it sure for the case of privacy of every person. This will makes it more efficient and advanced for the users to use it as compare to GB and other whatsapps.,4
com.whatsapp,linda xx,"the new update is the worst thing ever - you can't even send one time viewing pictures (which you cannot make Screenshots off no more either which is completely dumb) from your laptop no more let alone open them - and for me, someone who uses their laptop for everything this is just so silly.

com.whatsapp,Srikalpa Bhat,Please remove the feature of veiwing status from profile picture by the side of the chat so that the mantra of connecting people of the app stays intact because I feel people will eventually start getting used to see status there itself then the status section of the app. Disappearing message is a really good feature🤩 include group chat also for Disappearing messages.

Because the receiver will always be ready to screen shot (it's not possible now, which is great) or screen record what they're going to see if they see view once icon on their screen. Please make this possible in the future update. Thank you.",2
com.whatsapp,Sinmi Oyedele,This app is becoming rubbish I can't increase volume of sound while watching a status and it keeps glitching every single time Your Video cannot play every single time I'll be trying to Increase the volume of the video watching a Status it will just show and stay the same actually telegram is better than WhatsApp this has changed my whole point of view,2
com.whatsapp,Graham Laird,Not Good on Pixel 7 Pro. The camera button in WhatsApp doesn't take as clear pictures as the camera is capable of taking. Particularly on the front facing camera which doesn't have a focus function at all in WhatsApp but also on the rear facing camera. It's far better to take photos in the camera app then click share and go to WhatsApp that way.,2
com.whatsapp,Mikołaj Kondratek,It is good until you need to move from Android to iOS. There is no way to move your chat history once the iPhone device is set up. Only paid 3rd party tools are available. Why don't you make it possible to restore Google drive backup regardless of the device type?,1

com.whatsapp,Hannah Parker,No idea what's happened to WhatsApp but now it doesn't show my photos to send. It only shows media I share with other contacts. It's incredibly annoying when this my primary app for contact. Tempted to swap to something else if this isn't fixed.,2

Recently got several updates but still doesn't work I don't know what's going on",1
com.whatsapp,Kristian Þ,Latest update has broken photo sharing functionality. As others have pointed out in recent reviews it's no longer possible to easily share images from your phone. I can only assume this is a bug but I've no idea how to report it so I guess we just have to hope they fix it and release an update,1
com.whatsapp,Oli Robinson,This was great but I can't send vidoes anymore to anyone for the past few weeks. Redownloaded the app maybe times but when I try to send a video it keeps telling me to restart my device. Plus I have data backup that all disappeared or won't load,1

All I get are variations of ""request a text and if you had many attempts - wait"". I do not receive texts I have waited for way too much time to get it resolved. There is zero help from Meta. At this point I have had enough and ready to switch. If your account is still ok - set up 2fa. I would not have this issue if I did.",1
com.whatsapp,Imran,"I can't use WhatsApp phone call and my phone at the same time, it mutes my voice for some reason and I have to stay on whatsapp the whole time.

com.whatsapp,OM,WhatsApp first of all I am thankful for you've added the poll feature which is super essential nowadays.Now secondy requesting you to add two more things.Adding a survey option in which questions might be asked and people might give the own replies instead of selecting pre-written replies in Poll. 2nd. Add a highlight message option in which the message might be highlited by admins/owner. This is not to be confused with Starred messages,5

com.whatsapp,Siddhant Shenoy,While scrolling there seems to be a new bug which directly makes us skip a few of the messages and secondly there seems to be an error with the message delivery system where I have to reload the app to know that the message is either sent or seen by the other person ( the tick and clock remains static while in the chat without changing until I come out of the chat),1

com.whatsapp,David Divine Tisha Lungu,"Simple, fast, quick and easy. Although, it doesn't have it's flaws here and there.

Anyway 4 stars, until this little thing is solved (then I give a 5 star review)",5
com.whatsapp,Max Rodriguez,The last two updates come with annoying issues when personalizing sounds for contacts.

Please fix this!",3
com.whatsapp,Rasilaben Mokani,"I like the app, but updates weren't getting worse till date. In the new update, Archived section shows on top!

Who would like to write caption again and again? Please improve the app. Otherwise my rating is 5 stars. Thank You.",4
com.whatsapp,Athar Khan,"Remove the image compression.

A user don't have to check all those criteria before sending image. Just remove the image compression and there will be no problem. Also, add feature to hide online status.",2

com.whatsapp,Eileen Ay,"This used to be a highly reliable five star app. But since May I have been unable to send videos. On top of that when I reach out for help, I get a bot response and nothing else. A few months ago I reached out and got a response that they were aware of the problem and working on it. I have updated the app, run through all the various troubleshooting I found online and nothing works. I'm pretty disappointed in this app. Ever since Facebook took it over, it has gone in the garbage.",1
com.whatsapp,Stella Adimchinma,"My experience in using the app is nice but I would appreciate it if you add my suggestion in your settings. I suggest you add a setting where by you can set your WhatsApp in such a way that only those people in your contact list can chat you up not some stranger you don't know, and not for one to wait until the stranger chats him/her up before blocking, but if there is such in existence already please I would love to be directed on where to see the setting in the app, thank you.",4

If we wanna send something: Status,Chats, Emojis and what not we think of can be sent to our close relatives/friends whom we miss. I love the new features but just one major problem that if we send a video of 3-4 minutes on Status we have to send the same video 5-6 times,as it only allows a video of 30 seconds.

com.whatsapp,Vincent Michael,"Honestly, I have no issue with WhatsApp until now. The update that shows a list of common emojis when replying to a status is a big flop.

I really wish something can be done about it. Thanks.",3

Secondly, even if we back-up all our data to google drive, it doesnot restore things properly, never. Most of images, videos & audios are not recognised they are shown to be downloaded again. And during the shofting process, most of the new unread messages are gone away. Pretty annoying. And there are yet many more issues.",2
com.whatsapp,UMMAY KULSUM ABBAS,"Nice app. But the latest update is weird, if I am clicking on a anyone's dp who has posted a status then it atomatically shows the status of that person, and If I want to see anyone's dp then I have to go inside that contact and then tap on the picture and then it will show a pop up box after that I have to choose whether I want to see the status or dp, so its a long process for watching dp.

My phone can do a billion interesting HD vibration patterns, all of which are quieter and less intrusive than even the ""short"" setting in WhatsApp, and all of which have no issues playing nice with my other apps.

I've got all my voice notes and all videos from last month saved on my phone and they are fine, but when I go to whatsapp to tap them, they say, ""sorry, this media file does not exist on your internal storage, when it does"". An admin shouldnt get to delete what others post, and why will only Admins be notified of a gc exit. Dumb. Fixing what ain't broken. I'd give it 0 stars if I could",1
com.whatsapp,Vishal N,Don't see the point of disabling screenshots altogether in disappearing photos. Atleast allow the user to toggle it off for themselves if they don't mind their photos being screenshotted. Or allow it on a per photo basis. The point of disappearing photos was to not clutter the storage and save only what was needed (by taking screenshots). This completely removes the benefit and reduces it's usecases to extremely few. Please allow users to toggle it off for their photos.,2

Have never been so annoyed of any app.",1
com.whatsapp,Riniam Tassar,Whatsapp just never notify me when i get messages. It's been like 5-6 months since it started to happened. I only get notification when i turned off my power saver mode and if i switch it back on it just doesn't notify me anymore and i have to go check on it myself every now and then to see if i have missed out on any updates. Please fix this issues as soon as you can!,2

com.whatsapp,Aafaq Ahmad,I am using this application. It is working very well. But if whatsapp company add a new feature in it then it will be very helpful. I recommend you to add the mention feature in status. So that one user can mention someone and if one person mention someone then the receiver get a message that someone mentioned you in his status. This feature will be very helpfull. It will like the Instagram story mentions. I hope you will check my feedback Thank you...,5
com.whatsapp,Lexi J,"Was great until recent update. Now when you go to a group chat it opens at the most recent message rather than your first unread message so you have to scroll endlessly to fond when you were up to. It also stacks repeated messages from the same person without repeating the contact name so it can get confusing tracking who messages are from in a group chat, particularly when people send repeated messages or are replying to someone elses earlier comment. Please undo these changes!",3
com.whatsapp,Programming Only,Suggestion: As of now status video length can be 30 seconds and if user want to keep longer length video on status then it needs to crop video for 30 sec again and again. So Whatsapp should add feature like once user choses longer length video it should allow to select from and to more than 30 seconds and automatically there should be split into 30 second chunks. May be the case like same feature is available but I am not aware of it. Sorry if already present. 1star for attention only else 5star,1

com.whatsapp,00 7,Can WhatsApp explain the inexplicable reason why there is a feature to invite LANDLINE contacts on my phone to join WhatsApp? What a stupid feature apart from having to scroll past to reach the contacts that are MOBILE numbers. A green dot notification on a green background for incoming messages is a real plus.,2
com.whatsapp,Mary M,Don't like that it changes my parameters/ settings when I update. Plus seems to use a lot of mgb to do so even though it only takes 30secs- 1 min to do so. I have lost contacts & other critical information when I have updated previously.,1

com.whatsapp,Paul Tersoo Orkpe,"Pretty nice, but I would like the developers to enable the delete functions for admins to delete messages that are not needful in a group chats from other members view to avoid group interruption. Thanks plz you guys have done a good job. Also the developers should include online notifier for all contacts, not necessarily when you open one chat page before you can see if a person is online or not, but once you open your WhatsApp page it should notify like FB messenger does. Thank you",5
com.whatsapp,anurag deol,"I want to give u some suggestions.  You guys just got a new poll feature out. Similarly, you can also add new feature like a reminder. As in big companies the employees have to be reminded again and again. An alarm should be set in the group so that this work does not happen again and again. Same type as the alarm works. If you are interested in my suggestions, then I can explain to you in full details.",4
com.whatsapp,Kiara Nicholson,The latest update does not allow you to play music in the background during a video call. WhatsApp use to allow this. I loved it! I would call someone and talk to them while I listened to soft music or if I felt like having company but I needed to study then we would have a muted call while I listened to music.

com.whatsapp,Kristi Qirici,"I hate that this app is so popular, and it sucks if you have a busy life. There are no options for me to go completely offline without making the other party aware that I was on and ignored their messages. I've gotten in many fights because i ""ignored"" their messages.

If this feature gets added, (making me completely offline/invisible) this app will be perfect and i will change the rating back to 5 stars.",1

I have been using WhatsApp since it was launched with regular updates and changes when I moved to another country. It suggested to go to the Google store to get the correct version.. which is exactly where I am right now. It raises suspicion about the controls that they have in place.,3

com.whatsapp,Pratik Telgani,"SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE UI 1. Just justify the content in the text box, it is not very satisfying to see the text messages not properly alligned. PLEASE JUSTIFY THE SENTENCES INSIDE THE TEXT BOX OF BOTH SENDER AND RECIEVER. 2. And it would be better if the dark mode is DARKER (black not grey) 3. Adding a smooth transition for chats rolling up and down for new messages would be better to use",4
com.whatsapp,Anju Badhan,App can be more efficient if an email is attached with it for recovery.in case if we lost the number we can access to whatsapp through email. Also one more feature can be added that is message request. If any unknown person send us message it should have an option to check the message without the sender knowing.,5

So whatsapp cannot even let user know that it detected any existing,1

Please do something I can't lose my messages.",3
com.whatsapp,Karly Elizabeth,Has something just changed? Up until a few days ago if I had multiple voice messages they would play automatically one after another for however long they went for.

How do I make them keep playing even after screen timesout and locks?,3

But if I want to type ""Hello ❤️"", I want to be able to type that without having to go to the sticker panel and the switch to the emoji panel. Please.One last thing, the app constantly disconnects from the internet. Whereas other apps are working fine, it'll disconnect itself & I therefor cannot receive any texts or calls.",2
com.whatsapp,Joy Chen,"I appreciate having this app to communicate without boundaries whenever WIFI has reached. But I think that there is room for improvement.

com.whatsapp,Jaguar,If I could give you a minus rating I would. Everytime I upgrade your app I loose all my saved emojis. Your help centre gives me nonsence like the emoji is not compatible.

They also give some other uselesd advice like clearing cache etc. Very disappointed in your app.,1

com.whatsapp,asonye josephine,"The app has been good but with the recent update it's been really bad. I can't send pictures or upload pictures on my status. It's either blur or won't load at all saying ""the file is not a picture"". Please resolve this issue as soon as possible.",2
com.whatsapp,shiromi !!,"Hi, WhatsApp LLC. i rated this a 4 Star, because there was some bugs that was ALWAYS happening almost everyday! every time i'm chatting with my bestfriend, sometimes it randomly wouldn't let me send the message and its the clock logo. i don't know what happened, tried alot of tutorials but still didn't work. thanks.",4
com.whatsapp,עדיאל טוסון,"Awful, who is the idiot who thought about an update that literally all it does is making interrupting a video call a lot easier. Every time i touch the screen in a video call for more than half a second, the video does that weird thing.",1
com.whatsapp,SOUMILI KAR,"I am forced to give two stars. Because I don't know, I am having a lot of problems with contacts on WhatsApp. Sometimes I see that the number is saved on the phone, but it does not show on whatsapp. In case of others, half the name is showing. Someone is showing two names.",2
com.whatsapp,Nwokolo Godwin,"Please remove the ""add participant"" button from the WhatsApp call UI and put it somewhere else. Somewhere your skin or ears can't accidentally touch 🤦‍♂️. I find it amazing that accidental touches weren't considered when adding the buttons to the UI. Just build great software c'mon!",2
com.whatsapp,Augustin David,"Previously had issues but looks like it has been resolved. The app appears to be more reliable than the network service providers, especially mobile calls. Really appreciative of the effort and service provided by the Developers.",5
com.whatsapp,Viraaj gowda,"It's really good, but just one thing about the new updates. The feature that allows admins to delete anyone's message only works one message at a time. If you highlight more than one of someone else's message then it doesn't come up with the option to delete it for everyone else. Is that intentional?",4
com.whatsapp,Keenan Richmond,"I love the apps purpose and most things about it. But for some reason I can't get any pop up notifications. So when people text or call, I don't even know untill it randomly notifies me 12 hours later. This really is inconvenient for long distance and important calls for my family and I.",2
com.whatsapp,Nicholas Salmon,WhatsApp I meant tell you guys from a long while about this... I don’t who out there feels the same way also but is there way that certain videos can be sent to someone’s status without having to trim them in stages because it really takes up time esp. if it’s a min or two sometimes you have to just send the video link instead... Could you please do something about that limitation & give an update on that ASAP? 🎞️🤷🏽‍♂️,4
com.whatsapp,Okparaocha Samuel,"It's nice o, buh I frown at the low features of the WhatsApp. It does indicate when a friend is _online_ It should separate friends chat from group chats...having different role for each...so that one can easily locate any chat or any group. If the features of Gb-WhatsApp can be included in this one, I believe it'll become more interesting.... Thanks. My WhatsApp keyboard has changed o, the place for another paragraph has changed to sent... And since, chats haven't been interesting 😩",3
com.whatsapp,Kay Tzu,"Doesn't let you add contact in manually. Forces you to make a new contact in your phone's list, then it cannot find the new contact you made 3 minutes ago. Then I made a new contact in whatsapp contact list, and whatsapp cannot find the contact either. Now I have no way of messaging the contact. HORRIBLE User Interface!",2
com.whatsapp,Hayford Obeng Yeboah,A good communication app but there should be a feature which should enable a user to determine whether he wants to join a broadcast message or not. Some people just add users to a broadcast without their intent. It's irritating.,3
com.whatsapp,TheSecretCh1ldren,"I can talk to all my friends and family easily on this, and I call my mates every night on it. So far, very few issues apart from a recent glitch where group calls bug out. I'm sure it could be fixed on a software update though. Overall, geat app!!",5
com.whatsapp,Tumisang Softy Kgoadi,"The app is great in terms of messaging, and voice calls and video calls, the only problem I have is statuses. Please better your image quality. We take wonderful pictures, once we post them in our stories they become blurred .",2
com.whatsapp,Ram Spencer,Mist ridiculous frustrating back-up and restore system. Why can't you back-up and restore your chats locally? Features are also behind every other good similar app. Hardly any new features ever added. Theming options are also ridiculously terrible. Only keep this app around because of a couple of my contacts.,1
com.whatsapp,Kayleigh Wells,"Too many bugs. My app keeps saying it cannot respond. It is very annoying please fix. I have used what app for years and this is the first time I have experienced any issues, but these are super annoying issues that are really frustrating me. Please fix.",2
com.whatsapp,Clarice Chee,"Overall good app but WhatsApp has a glitch that even if I have internet connection, I still can't send any messages. Some of my friends have also tried sending messages but it didn't work too. And if I call someone, it says that I don't have internet connection even though I do. Hope you can fix this glitch",2
com.whatsapp,Nadha muni Tapala,"Hello, The main function.. notifications are not working in what's application latest version.

com.whatsapp,onkar mali,Unable to update status. Don't understand what is the issue. Able to receive and send messages. Mobile network is at highspeed no issue with the mobile network service provider. Tried reinstalling the app and lost data despite of backup.,1
com.whatsapp,Sina Ghassemi,WORST.APP.EVER this app is deprecated in technology and sells your personal data. Talk about a product with your friend and boom! You see the ads of that product everywhere. It also backs up your messages to the google cloud which is vulnerable to be hacked.,1
com.whatsapp,Kaycie Leigh,Now this is a really good app but there are a few things I would like to be added! 1: I would love if you could make little avatars and I heard you might be doing that!! Also instead of the caption at the bottom it would be cool if u could move it and it be like snapchats! Speaking of Snapchat you should also add some filters that u can post on your status or just save them 😉 thanks for reading ! X,4
com.whatsapp,Joy Adeboboye,"This app is so frustrating. If i wanna upload pictures on my status, it takes up to 30 minutes most times, and if i wanna delete a post, it can take up to 2 hours and during that time, no messages will come in and i won't be able to send messages",2
com.whatsapp,DjorO,"Stopped receiving pictures, files, calls. Deleted app, reinstalled app, gone through every fix and nothing has worked. I don't have an SD card, I have tonnes of space, I've restarted my phone (pixel pro) several times and still nothing.",2
com.whatsapp,Santprasad Vishwakarma,"After turning off read recipient, people who are in group with me can see my last scene and it shows double blue tick. Can you please tell me that, this is WhatsApp's feature or just a bug. Also, provide feature of editing sent message.",5
com.whatsapp,Galie Cheung,"Good app, I always use this to communicate with friends and family. I like the Gifs and emojis that are added. What I really like about this is that you can send youtube videos in the same app instead of going to youtube and sharing back and forth. Overall I will give Whatsapp 5 stars to rate this awesome app. I like that this app doesn't require any wifi but still, it doesn't always work. Like one time I was in the car using it and then I randomly logged out so pls fix the bugs and problems 🙃",5
com.whatsapp,Zeeshan Iqbal,It's quite amazing app ... But now I'm going tell about a new feature... Sometimes I was writing a message but accidentally closed Whatsapp so my message that I was writing has been deleted ... So I thought if it has a feature that while writing a message if Whatsapp closed automatically then the message I wrote will be saved as draft it is quite usable... I hope you see my review and think about it... Thank you...,5
com.whatsapp,Abhishek Kumar,"WhatsApp should bring a feature in which only saved contacts can message. Because Fraud messages regarding lottery from foreign countries comes every week. Blocking the number is not solution because they message the same from other different no. As well as allow calls only from saved contact. Thanks ,WhatsApp user",2
com.whatsapp,Ukpai Paschal Ebele Elmer,"The app is great and you guys are doing a great work to better our life both in communication and luxury. Please If you guys can include a feature where you can use Audio or voice clip to update ur statues, also please add a feature where one can change to different theme apart from dark and light.

com.whatsapp,Chenod Karunaratne,"Whatsapp is so useful. And Whatsapp have group messaging. And we can get Whatsapp calls. That's why I love what app😄😁.... Overall the best messaging app I've ever used, it's easy to use, free and uses WiFi to message, when connected. But I'd like it if you could make it so that if you call someone but they don't answer/decline they could leave a reason why they didn't answer/decline, and you could leave a reason why you called and vice versa. Thx bro..... 🤜👌👋",5
com.whatsapp,Ayat Shouman,VERY BAD app I keep doing backup so not lose my data ... but one morning woke up and found all chats deleted .. and when i downloaded the backup it kept saying you have backup but we can't retrieve it and for 2 weeks mailing with WhatsApp technical team they couldn't help at all .. never trust this app as save place for your data ..,1
com.whatsapp,Vanessa Paul,"Since I updated few days ago, I haven't enjoyed it. In the last 24hrs, I've been blocked 3 times already, currently I can't even verify coz codes haven't been sent to my line till now. It's so annoying. I can't respond to any vital messages and cut off from platforms without understanding why. Kindly resolve this issue, it's exhausting.",1
com.whatsapp,Veronica Ajunwa,I think this app interface needs to be improved. For instance: 1. Contact chats and group chats should be put separately. 2. There should be a widget that helps users download photos from other people's status 3. There should also be customized texts and colors. As this helps users in generating their brand colors and text. 4. Incognito mode for preventing unwanted contacts from viewing wether you are active or not. 5. There should also be a widget to download texts from status.,3
com.whatsapp,Vivek Gupta,"For some reasons my whatsapp is showing a few contacts that are nowhere saved on my phone. I tried reinstalling the app, changed permissions, resynced contacts but its still the same. How can I get rid of it ? I don't want to breach anyone's privacy as the phone numbers, display pictures and status for these UNKNOWN contacts are visible to me",1
com.whatsapp,Michael Kozikowski,"Abhorred Experience. You need to have a sim card to add a contact. The only way around this is if someone messages you first. Only then can you use this godforsaken application without a local sim card. On top of that the UI is garbage. I'd go in detail, but I'd be doing them a service and despise them to the point that I will only give them a garbage review as they deserve.",1
com.whatsapp,Anish Kalghatkar,From the last App Update WhatsApp Notifications and Notification Sound are not at all poping up. I have to open the Application to see the new messages and also there is no alert for them. This is a serious problem as from past 3 to 4 days this has started and since then there is no update pushed from WhatsApp. I request you to please resolve this issue soon.,1
com.whatsapp,Mevin_ Leo,"It will be better if you add a function for archive chats to stay archive on the very last end of chat list in whatsapp. When we archive chats,archive named icon will come in the top first and if we change it when message come archive chats will show in chat lists.It is a trouble or bad feature.so if you can change it please change it I'm giving one star less because of the problem in mentioned above. Although whatsapp is very nice♥️",4
com.whatsapp,Mikko -,They disabled the feature when you could play multiple voice messages in a row. This is dangerous when you have to listen messages while driving a car. Now you have to touch your phone to play every message and you could end up in an accident... SMH.,1
com.whatsapp,Daniel Ovando,It was fine and worked really well until the latest update. Now it's horrible to use. Bluetooth connections barely work and video call is impossible. You're better off using other apps at this point,1
com.whatsapp,Shailendra Karambe,It requires Phone permission to make or receive voice and video calls. This is unnecessary and in previous versions was working without this permission. And I'm surprised that Google isn't taking any action on this for asking Phone permission. This reveals the hidden agenda of stealing data and keeping watch on users.,1
com.whatsapp,javed iqbal,So good app. We like it very much. It will be a great opportunity for us. We send voice messages and pictures to others people. We are highly motivated our all friends to use this app. It is a good way to talk one and others. So we request to you make it more powerful and easy and economical. This app serves is better than all other apps.,5
com.whatsapp,Rishabh Gupta,"All over app is good, but i would like you to fix the live location issue. The live location stops updating when the phone is locked. It should be continuously updating the location even if the phone is locked or the app is closed. It will be a really great update.

com.whatsapp,Sharon Rosenow,I can't even access the app now. The past two days I've woken up to the opening screen with no progress past that. Ive reinstalled. Cleared cache. It'll work for a few hours after reinstall than nothing again. Started on Wednesday night,1

com.whatsapp,IFRA Q,"If there was a zero, I would put it. Can't change contact name. Pictures took on the app is so trash. Loading is very slow even with good internet.

com.whatsapp,Jane Obiako,"After this most recent update, if I edit pictures either by putting an emoji or drawing a line on it, it can't be posted or shared. It says sharing failed everytime...

com.whatsapp,Eunice Boterere,"Your problem is making this app unusable when out of date. Some marginalized people like us will not be able to update it instantly as soon as you release a new version. Allow it to work and notify users of the new update, they can update if they like the new features. Some people are just here for text, audio and video calling and not worried about who last did what where.",2
com.whatsapp,Joshua Atinyo,"This is a very simple and easy to use app with recent and relevant updates. However, kindly consider giving group admins the capacity to create a broadcast list out of groups. I think the recent feature only supports creating a community. This is necessary because some group members pay swift attention to direct messages compared to group charts. As well, group charts are most likely to be flooded with irrelevant messages and thus some group members miss out on relevant information. etc.",4
com.whatsapp,Kayula Musonda,"I love the creativity and innovation of the app! It'd really be nice if the ""archives"" can not be at the top of the chats' page. We archive chats for a reason, if you know what I mean😉. They can appear in the settings as a ""go-to"" option. Thanks in anticipation!",5

com.whatsapp,Henry Okoro,"Wonderful... Just wonderful I love all these new features They're too exceptional... Keep it up guys Though I think there should be one minor change... I think you should be able to at least see how many people have viewed your status Even though you turned off the read receipts... Please if you could try to do something on this, I'd really appreciate 🙏🏾",5
com.whatsapp,Tina C,"I still don't have the latest features, even though I have reinstalled the app twice now. I tried to get some advice from the developers, but they either send me a generic reply unrelated to the problem, or tell me I've already been replied to. Thinking of moving to another messaging service.",1
com.whatsapp,Oladimeji Favour,"I love the app. It's good. But it would be really greater if a chat could be created for 'saved messages' as we on Telegram, where one can save info, recording, and messages, to be sent later and not immediately.",4

com.whatsapp,Kishan Reddy,This new poll feature is not up to the mark because the voters are able to choose all the options in the poll but will be good when only 1 option can be chosen.....except if the questioner need a multiple opption answer.so i request watsapp devolopers to make some modification in this feature...or else i personally think it will not be much usefull......,2

com.whatsapp,Didi Henning,Chat is no longer private for voice notes. Does not mute the sound when trying to listen to the voice note in private. Plays voice note over the phones speaker for the whole office to hear. Tried changing settings bit nothing seems to work.,1
com.whatsapp,Shivum P,I hate this new interface to send pictures or videos. How do you revert to the old way? It is impossible to find screenshots using this new method and it also feels more difficult to find what you are looking for!,1
com.whatsapp,Michael Gomes,"The Beauty of WhatsApp is it's simplicity. Don't add unwanted features trying to make it the second facebook or second Instagram, just let it be WhatsApp. Simple, private, secure, messaging app nothing more. Need more features? Like community and organization of different groups on a very large scale? Use whatsapp business. Keep it simple aye? If it's not broken don't try fixing it.",3
com.whatsapp,Eric Murungi,"Google drive back ups take too long to complete. Also, please could you enable a two panel UI for foldable phones and tablets so that we can see the message list on one side and the messages on the other at the same time.",4
com.whatsapp,Muhammad Nur,I love using this app. Easy to use. I use this app for works. But it is quite annoying bcs i have to log out every time i get out of my desk at my office so that nobody can accidentally read my text on the screen. So each time i do this i have to wait a quite sometime for all of my massages to redownload and resyncing with my phone once i login.So I really hope that what's app could improve the What'sApp Web which to include password protection for web features so i don't have to log out again.,5
com.whatsapp,Jade Clark,"Great app, works well. I just don't like the fact that ANY number, even if it's not saved on your phone can contact you. It's actually quite dangerous. Especially when minors are on this app.",3
com.whatsapp,Erick Mark,It's a good app and the developer has actually attempted to upgrade it. One request though...if the developer can include the option of separating chats from groups and also maybe the one for being able to ghost view and save statuses as in the duplicate Whatsapp versions would be a total game changer,3
com.whatsapp,Sherri Berger,"Love what's app. Love recording voice message feature where you can hear the person's voice in a text. Quicker to record than typing for me too. Love how you can swipe a person's comment from above so that person knows what text you're commenting on. Overall, wonderful app.",5
com.whatsapp,Mayank Mehra,"Well, i believe there's something wrong after recent update. WhatsApp has temporarily banned my account for no reason two times since yesterday. People might have something important going on and all of a sudden getting banned and waiting for an hour with no option to open it is just annoying. Slowly moving my communications to Telegram.",1
com.whatsapp,R Bhargavi,the long press on the app icon shows the most frequently contacted details. i do not like this feature and i learnt this feature cannot be disabled as of now. i hope they change it...,4
com.whatsapp,Joe Yus,"WhatsApp is a nice application. I am enjoying your free services. Please, the recent update that changed the position of the 3 icons on the status page to the top right corner is not ideal for mobile devices.

com.whatsapp,Yash Kumbhar,"Worst app ever published on Play Store... Like I was on call with my friend in UK and more than half of the tym call was reconnecting, even we both had super stable networks... Snapchat is far better than WhatsApp.. even if someone ran out of data , Snapchat calls are smooth even on 144kbps , I have one good tip for WhatsApp, shutdown your servers and take a leave and enjoy (for lifetime) bcuz all features are copied from different apps , and atlast don't forget about your father (Telegram)✌️☮️",1
com.whatsapp,Arvi Goyal,"I really like your application as it can allow keyboards to access to whatsapp and it also allows to video call,text and message to anyone at any moment.There are also a lot of gifs and stickers of different expressions depending upon the mood of an individual :D",5
com.whatsapp,Allan Jacob,"Love WhatsApp. Have been using it since it started. Although, I didn't come here to actually review though. I came here to ask if something is possible. A schedule send option for WhatsApp, don't know if it makes sense for a lot of people. But I think people using WhatsApp for work, an update like this might come in handy. Rather than remembering to send something in the morning, why not schedule it off in the night. Please do tell me if it's possible or even if it's not. Thankyou!",5
com.whatsapp,Alle Gee,"Just horrible! This app tells you it will update in 30 days, you choose to update now and it keeps telling you you are logged out and you need to obtain a new verification code. This is so stupid because it does it many times until you run out of options to request a verification code and you need to wait for EIGHT HOURS to request a new one. I have lost all of my messages for the last 10 years. This app used to be my go-to, but not anymore. It is ruined now! Thanks for nothing Whatsapp! 😡😡😡",1

com.whatsapp,venkatraman G,Send message without saving a number is more helpful. If possible please change this specification. For ex : I got one customer support service or any other business account WhatsApp number. Without save the number we can't send message. Copied that number or type the number in contact search box. If search number is available WhatsApp then we want to show the contact.,4
com.whatsapp,Esther Mutahi,Kindly consider working on this. What's photos are never clear. Photos do loss it's quality. 2. Is it possible to have chats and groups separated. 3. Can we have more themes available for one to be able to choose what's working for them.,1

All i get from contacting y'all through customer support are automated copy paste reply and non-relevant reply.

com.whatsapp,Awais Khan,"What need to add community feature every person unhappy from this feature it became useless this app. What was the need to add online status show or hide feature. Please remove online status hidden option. Simple WhatsApp was much better than this version. The option ""create call link"" should be removed from this version. When we are listening to the voice message in the background and it remains on the top after it ends, it should be automatically removed from the top after listening. Old V😒",1

I've been forced to use the business app because the regular app is not working on my device.

Fix the issues so I can go back to using the regular app,1
com.whatsapp,Leo,"Recent update is annoying. Now when I open the app, all my whatsapp contacts are there, along with all my contacts whom aren't using the app, and it asks me to invite them.

I only want to see my contacts which are already using the app.",1

com.whatsapp,Rameez Tariq,Overall its a nice app to use but in android there is a problem your backup photos and videos will blur after few months if you turn off the save photos and videos to gallery option. But in apple photos and video remains forever with backup. Whatsapp android version would like be the iphone whatsapp version. That is why 4 stars to whatsapp android version.,4

com.whatsapp,LAWAL HABEEB,The fact that every update comes with something special is 💯 dope. But why can't we still edit our messages? People make a lot of mistakes that they would like to correct but there is no room for editing. Do something about it. It's very important!,4

com.whatsapp,Anshul Parchanda,Worst app to use as there is not real support to look after any cases there are only bots that replies to your emails when you really need the support. You will be getting same reply again and again when you try to get help and there are too many bugs in this application which are not solved by their developer as because they are lazy and just work for money not for the betterment of the application.,1
com.whatsapp,Elyssa Gibbons,I think there's a virus on the app my phone screen goes black when I'm on call and it flashes black but takes a while to stop. It also disconnects me from different games and stuff like that please check this out it only happens when I'm on call,2

com.whatsapp,Abdultajj,"I have only one suggestion, hope it will be considered. I want WhatsApp to enable deletion and editing of messages sent without time restrictions and without notifying the receiver about it. We are all humans we make mistakes sometimes you would send a detrimental, insulting, derogetory, or an erroneous message that you'd regret a fraction of second after hitting the sent button. If implemented, it will go along way in improving relationships, businesses, etc. Thank you.",4

Not many complaints really, other than the odd problem I have with the camera; if I want to record a video with the flash, I can't, the flash just doesn't come on? But it does for photos? It's very annoying. And another problem is sometimes when I want to shorten a video it doesn't work and just keeps playing from the original start and shutting down and reopening the app doesn't fix it. Other than that, amazing app, I use it on the daily basis. :)",5

com.whatsapp,Konstantin Voloshin,"When I receive a floating notification in Whatsapp while watching a video in full screen, the combination of translucency of the notification window together with black font make it incredibly hard to read the message. Yet, the notification window still does a good job of obstructing a part of the video. A much better job than of showing the message. I would have tried to tweak the translucency, the font color to achieve better results, but there doesn't seem to be such an option 🙃",3
com.whatsapp,Jess Jtk,"And again having a problem with the voice messages! I can't listen to them in ""silence mode"" anymore. Usually you were able to listen to a message if you hold up the photos to your ear. Doesn't work anymore! Please fix that!!! Also messages are not going through even if they're shown 2 checkmarks. And not getting notifications when I'm getting calls!",2
com.whatsapp,Ric TheSeagull,"Unfortunately, the new update has added a glitch that has narrowed the space to view when searching for gifs to ridiculously small. I tried to contact them on this but doesn't seem no-one wants to know, so downgraded it. The app was suprisingly very easy to use and setup, it's no wonder why it's so popular and is a great way to share photos and videos! I will strongly recommend this and those who haven't yet tried it, to put aside their fears and give it a go!!! There is no registration needed!",4

com.whatsapp,David de Muinck Keizer,"I get constantly interrupted by a popup saying that it's creating a local backup. ""Backups occur at 02:00"", even though it's a completely different time. It disables the entire app. If you leave the app, the process pauses until you go back to the app again, so you can't even do anything else either until it's done. So it makes my phone unusable for a couple of minutes. No way to turn it off. Who thought this would be a good idea? Make it a background notification again. This is unacceptable.",1
com.whatsapp,Shar Mun,"I've been using the app for a few years now. Normally, whatever the bug was, it was resolved pretty quickly within 2-3 days. But exactly a week ago, the contacts' names on my whatsapp disappeared and were replaced by their numbers. App is updated, phone is updated, and contacts are synced. A little frustrating because I need to carefully check I'm sending the correct messages to the intended party. I hope this issue gets resolved soon. Thank you.",3
com.whatsapp,Inas Astila,I think it would be perfect if I can access Whatsapp on several (or at least 2) gadgets. It is a lil bit uncomfortable for me to switch from Android to iOS and vice versa since the interface looks so different. Maybe it will help a lot if I can access on both as I learn to understand and familiarize myself with the new device. Please consider this.,4
com.whatsapp,Richard Jansen van Vuuren,"It's not perfect, I get that. I've just been having issues with the voice notes and occasionally the call feature. Both have bombed out either when I start or halfway through. I'm hoping that a ""clean"" installation will hopefully resolve this issue for me. ———Update——— After patiently waiting, WhatsApp promising they're looking into the voice note recording issue and and then closing it. I'm disappointed to say, 2 updates later and still the same result with no feedback on progress or cause.",3

com.whatsapp,Fatima Adreeta,Auto-updated my whatsapp messenger. My whatsapp was running on an international number. But whatsapp provides no additional verification unless the code provided in the number via SMS. Which means a lot of important business dealings were lost. Then I had to install whstsapp for my local number. There should really be more than this one-step verificwtion for authenticating users.,2
com.whatsapp,Lee Wenhui,Overall its a good app. But when I'm on call with my friends it always reconnects even tho my WiFi is strong?

Why not do what Instagram does with the ""unsend"" option??",2

Just that I have tried too many times. So I wait the 48 hours before I can request a new OPT... No OPT, if I ask for a call, it says wait another 24 hours. I don't know how to fix this. I'm running a business and loosing clients.",1
com.whatsapp,ANJORIN IBUKUNOLUWATOMIDE QUADRI,"This is a great app in most ramifications. Kudos to the developers. I actually wanna comment on the latest update with the ""Poll feature"" One can vote for all options (that's renders polls useless, what's the point?) One can vote and unvote(so bad, one needs to be able to vote once, not unvote after) One can see other users votes when one hasn't vote (this influencesthe independent choice of user when voting) One can see people who vote and the options they voted for (votes shld b Anonymous)",4

com.whatsapp,Kay Smith,"Only 2 things I wish whatsapp would change is to PLEASE give an option to not show you are currently online. It sucks when you are speaking to someone but not able at the time to respond to someone else and then get a message saying they see that you are online! Like I'm in a business conversation! Next it would be lovely to select who you want the ""read message"" on for like on imessage. Some people I want them to know I read their message where as others, not so much",3
com.whatsapp,Zehui Li,Very inconvenience to make a conversation after you login from a new device. Only display the group chat. Person chat dispersed totally even can not find out from phone book if the people not allow WhatsApp to view it. Only one way to resolve it is that wait for the people contact with you at next time.,1

com.whatsapp,Shayan,"1. Meta could introduce the ""Restrict number"" feature in WhatsApp, just like there is a ""Restrict account"" feature in Instagram. 2. Moreover the online presence feature could be improved, by adding another feature for ""Contacts Only"". 3. The ""delete for everyone"" messages shouldn't be shown as Message Deleted once deleted, it's unnecessary. 4. The pay icon should be moved into the 📎 for mistouch prevention. 5. Can improve the Video Call quality with low bandwidth same as voice call.",3

com.whatsapp,Gabriel Pereira,"Of course I use this app a lot, you cannot escape it's use in several countries. It is however pretty insane that it does not support the web platform on tablets, or at least using the app as a secondary device. Other messaging apps are plenty able to do this, and I can't use my Android tablet as a larger screen to message anyone at work so long as this is the case. With the increase in the tablet market as a substitute for a lightweight workhorse, I really hope this gets fixed.",2

A company as big as Meta masked their error as a 'functionality'. An ugly functionality. Worst experience ever.",1
com.whatsapp,Presilla Kim,"It's nice, but please remove the setting whether we can see that person is online or not. Not last seen, but the online one. That thing is important. It's not abt privacy. It's abt the relationship that will be affected by it. The read receipts too. Please remove them. It is really unnecessary and unhelpful in my relationship.",3
com.whatsapp,Lisa,"WhatsApp stopped working, so I uninstalled and reinstalled. Since doing so, I can't use the app at all! It is demanding that I share ALL my phone contacts so it can ""help"" me keep in contact. I never had to do that before. I only use WhatsApp to keep up with friends overseas, and those are rhe only people's contact info I want in the app. What gives here?

Updates should be done annually or at least every 6 months. One thing that they have failed to fix is the Video Status Upload, EVERYBODY HATES IT. So for that only 3 stars and also the upload photo to status which doesn't open gallery and you have to scroll through each picture when you have no clue when you will find it.",3

com.whatsapp,Pragyasree Saha,"I was really pleased with WhatsApp until the recent update arrived. I mean whatsapp already had three separate spaces for 'chats', 'status' and 'calls'. So then why are you interlinking between chats & status and making us see all the status whenever we want to see a person's dp and not even letting us zoom it to see properly!! We will see the status of our friends when we want, why are you forcing us?? This last update is really ridiculous & frustrating.",1

I hate technology which disrupts privacy and independent experience of life... Such a fragile and short life has got collapsed into a mobile and further minimised into whatsapp.",1
com.whatsapp,Average White Guy,"Every update breaks this app a little more. Now you cannot change who sees your status because when you de-select someone from the list, the confirm 'tick' at the bottom of the screen disappears and so there is no way to confirm the change and all you can do is discard the changes and go back. What a surprise Meta is trying to destroy this app. Avoid there are so many better messaging apps out there. Would rate 0 stars if I could.",1

com.whatsapp,Hassan Afridi,"I appreciate Whatsapp team for preparing such a brilliant app which But Whatsapp can't send a large video,it should be fixed. But the reason for three stars rating is that, it has the following drawbacks. 1) It can only send a video up to 18MB and it is such a very small video size, Whatsapp should send a video up to 100 MB like other chatting apps. 2)Status can only be uploaded UpTo 30 seconds, and it is truly a very short video. It should be increased to at least 100 seconds. 👍",3
com.whatsapp,Vicky Isliefson,"A week ago, it started putting white frames around people in video calls, presumably when they are speaking. However, it is so sensitive that it picks up any slight noise with the result that these white frames are flashing on and off all the time. It's annoying and uses up more battery life. The only way to stop it is to turn off your mic. Please go back to having no frames. Since you can only have 8 people in a group chat, it's not necessary.",1

Try and add a section for broadcast lists so we can access our broadcasts easily rather than scrolling through many chats.

That section benefits only Administrators of groups, if you're not an admin in any of the groups on your phone then that aspect become useless.",4
com.whatsapp,Sahil Sandhu,I request app developers to make a reform in very next update. There should be option of sending pictures to a person in due quality.

It is really annoying whenever I see the archived chats being on top of all the chats. Think for yourself, if one has archived a chat forever, it is just for the sole reason of not seeing any of its presence, again. But with your current feature, the ""Archived"" chats option just comes on top of all the chats in WhatsApp. If I'd ever need to see any archived chat, I'd prefer to see it from somewhere else.",3

I really hope you can do better, especially esp. language",1
com.whatsapp,vipin srivastav,The new update is great however the call link that was shared doesn't has an expiry to it which means anyone who shared the link and the one who received the link can join the call anytime. Solution I think could be we should add an expiry time to the link shared or as soon the call initiator disconnects or leaves the call the receipts should no longer have ability to join the call. Hope this helps and Mark Zuckerberg identifys my comment and appreciate in any form.. 😀😀,5
com.whatsapp,precious zurike,What'sapp has no idea how happy I am with this new update. I'm super impressed. Only thing left is the notification that pops up when you delete for everyone.

Why people use this for international communications and business is beyond me. I can't simply add their number to WhatsApp for the one week per year I work with them? Ridiculous,1
com.whatsapp,Ak_D Gaming,"It's overall great application to chat with friends and family ... But nowadays there are many scammers who message and harrass you with unknown numbers...

Please add a feature so only our contacts can message ..",3

com.whatsapp,Songs X,"Really a good one. Could improve voice calls. Sometimes they just cut off (cut out). And not allowing anyone block you (away) with no a really good reasonable reason. I mean, usually strangers here can block you so easily. So you can never be friends with strangers if they don't give you the chance and they block you so fast just for being a stranger. It doesn't work like in real life. So you could make some communication features more realistic like in real life (a more natural communication).",3

com.whatsapp,nadeeka rasangani,Whatsapp is very convinient to use compared to other apps i really like it. Fast msgs less data consumption however its better if whatsapp can add edit msgs. Its very inconvinient to send messages over n over again due to spelling errors and also when msgs r deleted inthe chat the oposite party can see we deleted something i think thats inconvinient to most people. People usually ask what we have deleted. But overall whatsapp is perfect getting these problems solved will make it much better.,5

com.whatsapp,Pushpa K,Suggestion: You can also provide a new feature for using WhatsApp web that is password protection for using the same.

com.whatsapp,Raymond Spillane,I've never been happy with WhatsApp using internal storage as default location for all media sent or received. This was especially when devices averaged 32gb internal storage or less. Nowadays with phones having hundreds of GB of internal storage it might not be such a big deal but I still would like to see WhatsApp allowing users to select their default storage location of choice. Surely it can't be done without too much difficulty so users can make their own choice for default storage setting.,3

com.whatsapp,Kylami,"It's great for fast messaging and stuff, but I'm very annoyed with how it changes settings without my consent, such as permanently putting one of my contacts on mute with all attempts to unmute them in particular being futile, or selectively changing notification settings by itself, or not selecting the correct photos I intend on sending to people this past week. What happened? Why's it suddenly so buggy? Why is the troubleshooting process not helping?",2

com.whatsapp,Umair Ahmed Siddiqui,Justvin the new update when you delete mesages from chat it doesnt sort on dates. Instead it remains jn the same position. Pathetic when you are sending several mesages and then have to delete so the imp chats come up,1

Instagram works fine, updates easily with whatever storage space i have and doesn't forcefully demand update either...and interestingly both apps are from same company then why Whatsapp is such a disgusting app???",1
com.whatsapp,Anupama Holla,"The current features are really User friendly, secure to communicate, faster, easy to access, but i have one additional feature idea which would really be helpful for many who are clumsy or error making while typing some text like me 😝 ....

com.whatsapp,Ami Cooke,"What exactly is the purpose of this app? It does not allow you to create a new phone number; it simply shoehorns itself onto your existing phone number, which is required in order to even use the app. This app is nothing but a worthless middleman that allows Meta more intrusion into your life.

com.whatsapp,Joshua Mawuli,"I noticed that in your recent update, you guys now show the status privacy settings when someone is writing a status. But in doing so, you have shifted the input options like emojis and text style to the top of the page. I personally preferred it's previous position just above the keyboard since it makes input easier. The privacy settings can be placed at the top since we won't change it that often. That's my suggestion",5
com.whatsapp,Kunjesh Parikh,"It will be better if a single emoji message in reply to a particular message can be automatically converted to a reaction, instead of sending it as a pure message. Also, Why are disappearing messages only available in a group where you are an admin?",5

com.whatsapp,Stalin Sapam,It's a good app for sending massages. But the thing Iam very disappointed about this app is that when I upload a 1080p video or better it automatically converts it into a very low quality video...like a thrash video and it's the most annoying part of the app. I'd this issue for a long time and developers should know this and fix this as soon as possible.,2

com.whatsapp,Е,"Notifications are broken. What I mean: Notifications sometimes appear, have sound and etc, but sometimes they appear, don't have sound and disappear soon. However I can't really complain since notification code might have errors and is in try-catch block. And I hate the fact that your message will become ""This message was deleted"" after deleting it. Like, why do you even code such stuff? A deleted message should be completely invisible to everyone, not so everyone can see that you deleted it.",2

com.whatsapp,Madhu Sudhan Oleti,Disappeared option is a bug. This option should be applied only for individual or Admin. Not everyone in the group. It should be only applicable to everyone if it gets changed by admin not a normal group member. If an individual wanted to disappear option then it should work only for his phone not everyone in that group. Please kindly have a look on this bug and fix it ASAP,1
com.whatsapp,Richard Rodricks,Very useful app. But it should have additional security features when loging from a laptop or desktop. The login should auto lock or logoff when there is a long inactive period.,4

com.whatsapp,Augusta Aguele,WhatsApp is servig it's purpose. About 90 percent are happy using it. The amazing thing about WhatsApp is that it's saves you from embarrassent when you run out of credit to reach out to those on your WhatsApp chat. It could be video or just normal call globally.

Pls fix.",4
com.whatsapp,Carlos Ordonez,"using multiple phones with same # is a hassle due to dumb point to point encryption. Phone calls consume too much bandwidth, even with ""less data"". despite being careful, i have received a few darknet style messages. deleting old messages by date range impossible. Message delivery reliable. Web access, no install required on computer, works great. the fact that fb is disliked by so many people in the US it makes this app useless in the US!",3
com.whatsapp,Kathy,"Truly a frustrating app if you need to restore backup. I wish restoring from backup wasn't tied to logging in, if you have issues restoring backup they require you to REINSTALL to rectify the issue BUT they also softlock the number of times you're allowed to log in. Which means if you dont restore it perfectly you need to uninstall and try again... I've been stuck in this vicious cycle for far far too long (weeks). Good when it works, absolutely infuriating when it doesn't work intuitively.",2

com.whatsapp,Jim Bergevin Jr.,"A nice alternative to the built in Messenger app in phones. Allows for texting anyone in the world without incurring charges. However, there is no ability to configure the app to only allow messaging from your contacts. In order to prevent - I should say reduce - spam messages, you need to set your profile to private. However, as indicated this still does not prevent spam from random, unknown senders. There really is no excuse for any app of this nature to not have decent blocking features.",2

com.whatsapp,Philip Adesiyan,"This app is a very good app. However, as a suggestion it will be good to include options of doing voice/video call to broadcast group. So that it will not only be message that one can send. The advantage of this is that user doesn't have to create group for the recipients to call them. More so, if the call is just a once in a while stuff. Thank you.",5

Blocking ability to see all of what you are photographing. WhatsApp support says this is the intended functionality... Even though there is a button to go to the gallery. Terrible design!

com.whatsapp,William Coyle,It's a good app the only Annoying Thing is that too many people are trying to save their cell phone bills so they try and use it as their primary Communications at work which is pretty ghetto but the app itself is perfectly useful especially for group feeds among coworkers or especially among students to interact with instructors quickly,4

com.whatsapp,Leo Stache,"Why does this app need to create a copy of sent files? Why does opening a file save it to the phone? Why is that necessary? Literally any other app does not do this, or does so in a more efficient manner. I need this app for work. If that weren't the case, then I'd absolutely be using *anything else*.

com.whatsapp,Siddhi Kunjir,It's a very good app for conversation. I would request to developers that give an another option for restore messages.

com.whatsapp,Adeola Oriolowo,"WhatsApp is a great app actually. But I guess there are some things that needs to be improved. When someone is blocked,there should be a way one knows for sure that the user has been blocked,not only removing the profile photo,what if he/she wasn't using profile photo before. It causes a lot of confusion some times. And I guess it would be a great idea if you guys could create chat head like the one of messenger as one can always do two things at the same time. Hoping you would improve on this",4
com.whatsapp,Alec Mitchell,"So let me get this straight: you need to buy a data plan from a provider (have a phone number) before you can activate WhatsApp? So what's the point? Saving a few pennies on your data plan? You still have to pay for the original data plan each month, plus now you have this app to take care of. There are TONS of communication apps that DO NOT require a data plan -- and save you real money -- but I guess WhatsApp is the flavor of the month for trend followers.",1

com.whatsapp,Grace McLeod,"WhatsApp has disabled pop up notifications for Android 10 and above users. This is ridiculous as this app is a primary communication platform for many people, myself included.

So if there will be year wise text or audios deleting option that would be much easier for us.",5

They could have designed it so the code could be sent to you email - no brains!,1

Also if we scroll up in a chat and minimize the window and open it again all the chat goes back to the bottom or the starred text. I hate the update please fix these issues. Can't do much scrolling again and again.,1
com.whatsapp,Christoph Rechtlehner,Can't share or export media. Can't set media storage location to external storage. Can't permanently mute groups or contacts. No proper dark design. Web version often won't work and needs phone to be online. Can't use it on more than one device at the same time. How this garbage became so popular remains a mistery to me. I don't know a messenger that's worse.,1
com.whatsapp,Shereena Lim,I have a problem with backup messages and it happens on a daily basis now. The daily backup is so frustrating.

When I try to uninstall and install it back...all my images and videos are gone!!!! It even disappeared from my phone database... why is this happening.. pls someone help to check the bug....,1
com.whatsapp,Danfred Kettledas,Latest update. After viewing a video status the sound will still play even after you closed the app. There is no way to stop it from playing other then waiting it out or viewing that exact status again. Annoying when you are in an environment where you dont want to make noise,3
com.whatsapp,Salma .A,"Installed and took the option to restore past messages but the app keeps going through a repeated data download regardless past messages were immediately restored. Two days on, it still continues. Uninstalled twice but same problem and so decided not to restore data 3rd time round. Needs to be resolved because I've lost past history because of this issue",2
com.whatsapp,J K,"Simple but very useful suggestion please! I think the archived chats should be placed at the bottom of the chats section and not the top, secondly, it should have password or fingerprint access options to the archived chats and lastly, it would be nice if you can rename the archive to anything you like. I have several private messages I need to keep away from my girlfriend, I believe others would like such suggestions as well. I would really appreciate if my suggestion is considered. Thanks.",5
com.whatsapp,Arpita chakraborty,"I am using what's app from many years. But suddenly I am facing some issues. I am not able to download any recived photos. I have checked the storage isn't full.

com.whatsapp,MRF Pakistan,"Problems that Still Whatsapp haven't solved. When a person send a message with picture, when you try to forward it to other group, the picture is forwarded but the text isn't. When you open a Chat of unread msgs if you exit and enter it will show you the last msg not from where you leftout. There's much better chat apps then Whatsapp which provide above service and much more which Whatsapp don't have.",3
com.whatsapp,Glenda McLeod,"Everytime I download this app, it is hacked. The correct version of this app is not being downloaded onto my phone. It is now stating that Beta version of this applies!! It is asking for access to the camera before I can look at status and also access to the microphone in order to make/take calls. Never had to do this before. Many aspects of my phone has been hacked, to the extent that I am not confident I am communicating with those who are supposed to be in my contact.",1
com.whatsapp,Vajjala Jhansy,"Indeed it's a good application,but i wonder why from few days it's showing the wrong number of chats and the number of messages received in the notification bar.!!!??? For example, i am receiving notifications as 4 chars and 4 messages, but when I opened the window there is only one chat with one message. So,this is the recent problem i am facing. Am I loosing put any information ,or is it the technical glitches happenings from WHATSAPP MESSENGER!!!! kindly look into this concern!!",4
com.whatsapp,Charles Chimaobi,"Cropping and some bugs After updating this app recently I noticed I couldn't crop videos I wanted to send to someone, I mean whats tha point of removing a feature that important. If I play an audio message and leave the chat I played the Voice note in and then leave the app in the background the VOICE NOTE STOPS. This is why I hate updating apps they tend to remove important features without alerting. I'm definitely going back to the old WhatsApp. And update worse every single time.",1
com.whatsapp,Brooke Plotnick,"I'm trying to save a backup so I can transfer from a Droid phone to an iphone. That apparently exists as a new feature and it's not accessible because it is in beta, and the beta group is full.

com.whatsapp,Igomigo Fatai,"It's an overall excellent App, I love it's functioning, it's tools, and it's features.

Thank you Whatsapp.",5
com.whatsapp,Vinjeru Kalua,"Very good app but I personally feel like the view once option is good but what's, the point of having it if you can still take a screenshot?

com.whatsapp,Moon Mooni,"Hello whatsapp ;) Being part of many studying and work groups , i find it overwelming to send the same reminders pending chorse frequently as there are many participants and important messages get lost among other conversation. I wish if there is a way to add a pop up feature ( pinned message that is kept on top) . Thank u , great app awesome features. :D",5
com.whatsapp,Princita Miranda,"Whatsapp is really good but I wish y'all do a little update on pins, because more amount of groups the more our chat list gets piled up and most of the individual chats gets all unorganised, and messed up between the group chats I'm in, so if you update it in a way where I can use multiple pins instead of just 3 then I can seperate group chats from individual chats. In a way it's faster to give prioritize. Hope y'all take my request into consideration.",2
com.whatsapp,Andrei Stuparu,"I have been repeatedly been awoken in the middle of the night by the chat backup sequence. Who's marvelous idea was to make the phone vibrate every 2 seconds when the chat backup was underway? What is even the point to make the phone constantly vibrate just because it is doing a backup of the data? Why is there no way to deactivate this ""fantastic"" feature?( The vibration, not the scheduled backup)",1

I am facing the problem that when I receive whatsapp voice or video call, my phone doesn't vibrate, even if it is on vibrate mode and also I have checked all the settings but nothing worked for me.

com.whatsapp,K. Balamurugan,Trashy app. Account has been getting banned for no apparent reason for almost 30 times over the past week. I've been using this number for the last 10 years so I need to continue only with this. The same stupid computer generated reply comes on mailing and again I'll have the same issue popping up within a matter of minutes. I have been trying to rectify this for the last one month only to end up with the ban time and again. Isn't there any human there who can actually sort this out permanently?,1
com.whatsapp,Christopher,"Enjoyed the app until this last couple weeks. Suddenly ""my version of Android is unable to get notifications""... what? Not much of a point to a video call/ message app that doesn't allow you to receive calls and doesn't notify you when calls or messages are missed.",2
com.whatsapp,Nisha Agarwal,"Of late i am experiencing a lot of issues... 1. Had an issue where my chats were not backing up to google drive for about 15 days. Then suddenly one day it happened. 2.

com.whatsapp,Toxic Prince,"WhatsApp was the best social app ever before until now... Its unstable, sometimes we try to send media files over a minimum of 1MB it keeps on resending the file multiple times before its done sending.

It's handy to see the keyboard come up automatically instead of us doing an additional tap on the edittext field to bring it up",4
com.whatsapp,Virginia Charles,Since the most recent update it doesn't properly show the online information for the person I'm communicating with. It will say for example they were on at 9:30pm but I sent a message at 9:00pm and it doesn't show the message read. Or it will say it was read and they never got it.

com.whatsapp,Zypher Lee,"As a core messaging app, it's lacking many features. It'd be really cool if we could categorize chats and groups, and separately set download options for each category, and polls in group chats. Another feature that I think Whatsapp lacks in is probably themes, as competitors Telegram allows you to change it and even has multiple options to choose from. I'm rating it 1 hoping the team responds and considers adding these features lol I'd probably rate it 4 otherwise.",1

com.whatsapp,Oooo Oooo,I dont get for so many and very often update. What is usefull for? And also very often update for ToS? Anyway the new disappearing messages option is like a trap.

com.whatsapp,Mayuresh Pathade,The app is very good but following things can be added: 1. Hiding notification content for specific chats. 2. Hiding profile pictures for specific chats. 3. People can decide whose profile picture they want to see. If I don't want to see a specific chats profile pic then I can turn off something. So we can have more privacy for specific chats. Edit: 1. Feature to delete someone's seen status from the status list can also be added.,3
com.whatsapp,Lulu bebeluz,"After the latest update, the app is becoming... Weirder. When i first time updating it, i can't open the app until i get chat notification from someone. And now, it's freezing and lagging. I can't do anything. Even when i uninstall the apps, it's still like that. It's not the phone problem, cuz i has 2 WA. The other one is business one, and it's totally ok but the normal one is not. Please fix this, it's stressing me out. Sometimes, some fotos is not on my galery.",3
com.whatsapp,Chuksteve Okonye,"Nice app. But it will be very nice if you include programme for scheduled messages. In that case I can shedule a message for individual or group at a particular time and day. Also, edit feature should be added to individual status post to enable one correct errors in a status that's already posted.",4
com.whatsapp,A Google user,"I'm just using it because everybody does for work and such, however it's quite clunky, also bad in design. It syncs your contacs to give you trouble when you want to delete them, makes links everywhere with everything, plus you can't edit messages etc. Telegram is much more superior in my opinion.",1
com.whatsapp,Sharath kumar,"Recently facing a problem when we are seeing status , it automatically skips to last one and show loads the last status of same number and displays (there was an error playing the video) and some times it buffer the status comments written in the commet box .

com.whatsapp,Ryan Thompson,"It is what it is, only issue is I don't get message notifications, as others have stated the only way to know if you have missed calls or messages is to physically go in to the app to check. It's easy to forget to check and an issue I would of thought would've been sorted by now",3
com.whatsapp,Hayatudeen Adamu,"Am really pissed off at the moment because my recent update would not allow the App to display from last read messages rather, it displays the most recent one. I will have to scroll up and backward to be able to read from the last message. That is very annoying.",1

com.whatsapp,Sandeep Patel,Worst App ever used it doesn't recieve updates and is always glitchy and discriminant for different devices. Telegram being a stand alone company is able to give great features like having a lot of people in groups and uncompressed file transfer. I just don't get why whatsapp which is heavily backuped by a company oike facebook isn't able to even release a stable feature update in years.,1
com.whatsapp,Shashwat Sagar,"So last year, you rolled out new user agreement policies, which I haven't acceptedit yet and the app works. Here are the issues I faced since - Unable to join group video calls or make them, even unable to make normal voice/video calls. It always takes 4-5 tries to join. Sending messages or pics etc also have some issues (this started few weeks ago, it will send in multiple tries). Its not the internet issue or the phone. Do I really have to accept new user agreement for the app to work? ZERO ⭐",1
com.whatsapp,Semwanga Joshua,WhatsApp keeps turning off my display everytime I tap to listen to an audio message. It also plays the audios very low than the device volume. It just renders the entire experience plainly bad. I wish I could decide when I want this feature active or not.,3

com.whatsapp,Ahmad Judge,"This app is NOT reliable at all. Info get lost easily. It's really hard to back up and restore info on a new device or after installing it. Among all other problems we all know of, the most important problem is the loss of old data which had a very bad impact on my life, I would take stars from it if I could, so the one star I gave is only for being able to write the truth about whatsapp, It's not my choice to use this, I have to because other massaging apps are banned in the country I'm in now",1

We have to find another compressing application for that things. This actually makes me mad sometimes as i am an artist and i want to share many media files in video and all.

com.whatsapp,Alicia Benson,"I don't have issues using the app that others seem to (thankfully), and I like the features it provides, including the vast number of stickers you can download and use. So much better than my basic messenger. However, as ""Meta"" (🙄) keeps making bad decisions, my concern for this app disappearing or becoming unsupported only grows. Also I'm definitely the spiteful millennial who finds the consuming of smaller properties into one massive corporation to be... detrimental, to put it kindly.",4
com.whatsapp,D M,"Stupid update! Update: Another stupid update! Roll back to September 2019 pls.

com.whatsapp,Resul Serkan Keskin,It does not allow setting the daily backup time manually. I want to be able to use my phone at 2 AM but WhatsApp always manages to freeze my phone for at least 5 minutes. It should not be hard for developers to add an option for changing backup schedule.,1
com.whatsapp,Zamokwakhe Mbonambi,"It's a great app, the only turn off for me is that it's doesn't have a built-in translater or an in app translater. This is not good because the app is used for communication, for us who have friends who speak foreign languages it's a disadvantage.",4
com.whatsapp,Juergen Koreck,"Wow - when your Google drive backup gets stuck with restoring media, you're in for a big show. Reinstalling the app a few times results in the sms verification getting stuck. Not able to use it for 7 hours. I guess I'll find a different messenger...",1

com.whatsapp,Shubham Jain,"Didn't like the reaction feature at all. A touch little longer means I am giving some unwarranted reaction to the other person concerned. Plus it notifies them also even if I remove my reaction.

Why are you degrading WhatsApp???",1

com.whatsapp,Matthew Nwafor,"This new update lags alot. I'm always 20mins behind on statuses. It is never ""just now"" always 20 to 25 mins ago. And this muting of status is not good enough. There should be an option to totally stop seeing a person's status without the person restricting you. Despite muting the statuses, they still update where they are and it lags my device so much that i may not be able to use the app for almost two hours. Please if you can rectify this i believe your app will be a great app. Thank you",3

com.whatsapp,Rigoberto Felipe,It is the best app for communication with friend and family worldwide but I have a point to improve it.

com.whatsapp,Mrinal Singh,The app notification tone changes to system default in a few days or even minutes after changing it in the application settings. It has been like this for months now and it is frustrating. I am requesting you to fix the bug ASAP.,2

com.whatsapp,Oleh Live,"Useless customers support. No function to prevent people not from my contract list from calling me or writing messages, so if your phone number is in some spammers database - get ready to receive an enormous amount of spam messages and calls, and there is no option to prevent it.

com.whatsapp,Sarim Khan,"I think this is the best social media app to connect with your friends and family. No one is up to it. And over time, that is likely to change.

It is very much needed to make it better. Thank u.",5

com.whatsapp,MN Williams,"Why can you only pin 3 chats/conversations? Should be able to pin up to twenty. Also why does this app now send repeated notifications for unread messages...? I've left it unread for a reason, I don't need you to keep reminding me that it's there. It increases anxiety. This should be a feature that we can turn off. Annoying!",1

com.whatsapp,Emm Hartman,"Overall this app has won out over everything else my partner and I have used - I do however, really wish if they haven't yet, the devs would look into this android malware ""Agent Smith"". BC there are new variants that are much worse than annoying ads, steals PWs, accounts, ultimately rendering some devices to an unusable state (this installs to the reserved disk, so F reset doesn't fix).This app is one of the legit ones on that malwares ""prey list"", so it silent reinstalls a modded v. of W.A.:(",2
com.whatsapp,Dale Gallagher,"Clunky user interface. Don't trust Meta's empty promises of 3rd party data sharing.

com.whatsapp,Pradeep Kumar Mohanan,I got irritated most of times due to hearing issue on the other end.

Both video and voice call had the same issue..I don't know that am I the only person getting this issue or not.,2
com.whatsapp,Jim Peterson,I'd rate this app 0/5 if I could. It refuses to send me the code to register your phone. I have tried many times. Even tried undownloading it and redownloading it a few times. I've sent them feedback and have heard absolutely nothing from them. Don't waste your time!,1
com.whatsapp,A. Biscuit,"Sends messages in the correct order unlike other ""secure"" messaging apps.

com.whatsapp,Uchenna Victoria,Like WhatsApp did an upgrade and now to send a video to my contact the video is being shortened? Like I have to send videos longer than 3 minutes in bits? Are u people for real? This is not a status update o like sending a video directly to my contact and the length of the video is shortened?!!!! Are you going backward or forward?!

com.whatsapp,Diwakar pandey,Very useful application for one to one chatting. But chat backup (databases) uses too much storage space because it keeps 8 copies of backup.

com.whatsapp,Marley Fresh,"I love this app one of the best apps on my device but I would like if you can create a section for group just like the ones for chats and statuses bit it would be strictly for groups and chat for only private chats, I would all so appreciate if u could work on your backup because it takes too much data but you can't retrieve ur stickers on a new device.",4
com.whatsapp,Jennifer Dojino (FrigidRai15),The app is convenient and good though it doesn't notify me with sound sometimes if I have new message. It will be good also if you can star messages by contacts not for everyone so that we can search back easily for important messages and if you can easily go back to messages by date since it keeps coming back to the top after I copy messages.,4
com.whatsapp,Sonya Bailey Sosa,Something's wrong with your app because it does not allow certain phone numbers and erases them and put them in blocking mode when you try to call them you need to fix that it would be nice I'd appreciate it thank you very much cuz it was my first time trying to use it and it was crazy wasted a whole lot of time for nothing??,1

I do on occasion get odd messages meant for someone else who maybe had my phone number years ago(i've had mine for 5yrs but 1 name is consistent within these random messages) or it's just some minimal security issue that doesn't inhibit bots on occasion from messaging at random ..others not within my work chat but whom use WhatsApp so at times have same,3

com.whatsapp,Adedapo Osanyinbi,The backups on the device internal storage endup taking a lot of space. Not every message needs to be backed up!

Hope something can be done about that.",3

com.whatsapp,Scotty P,Like the app just wish we didn't have to hold the record button for videos. Would be nice if it can be a tap feature to start and end recording with the ability to rotate the camera during the video.,3
com.whatsapp,Kofi Adjei-Boateng,"It has been a pretty good experience. However, when sending a long video to your status, you have to keep going back to send it in portions. Can't we just send it once and have the app break it down into smaller chunks like Snapchat does?",4
com.whatsapp,Ida R,WhatsApp should ask for confirmation before making voice call or video call. Many times I accidentally touch the buttons and there is no way to delete the record. The opposite person comes to know about it. Kindly fix this problem,1
com.whatsapp,Creative Tutorials,App experience is good. Love the user experience. But tho the only issue I have with WhatsApp is that when syncing to PC it takes time. I don't know what new feature is being added but yeah this is not good for me. As I want my stuff delivered on time.,4

On an official FAQ page even the steps are mentioned, but when I try to follow through the steps it does not work even if I have the higher version of WhatsApp than mentioned in the FAQ and all other requirements fulfilled. I raised a support question they responded very vaguely that this new feature will be rolled out ""soon"". I think the FAQ page should have made this clear that this feature is not yet available and given a release date.",3
com.whatsapp,Sanni Philip,"I used WhatsApp almost every day I chat with my friends and also used it for work to Chat with clients and share documents I always wanted to feature that left you know your contact that are online from the chat tab maybe a green dot nest to there profile picture could help with that I think also, I will like to not just mute some status but also block them from appearing on list of status update thanks.",4

com.whatsapp,Ghost1994,I'll make it short The app in general is good but the only thing missing is the video call recorder I don't understand why we don't have this function Skype for example gives us the ability to record video calls with the permission of the other person unlike WhatsApp I need to use the screen recorder to record the video call but without sound This is so frustrating,3

com.whatsapp,Gbemisoke faith,Great app tho 👌 But I'm having issues in replaying previous voice notes as it keeps saying 'sorry this media file doesn't exist in your internal storage' I guess the updates are making former voice notes not to play anymore I'd appreciate it if you can work ok it. Thanks,3
com.whatsapp,BiNeel,This app may be good for communication.. But it doesn't have any option to keep it off or put it in off-line mode for some time. When ever I want to take break for some time this app is useless... We too need some personal time and space.,2

com.whatsapp,Sara BR,"why there's not an ability to edit our messages or delete them without showing this phrase ( the message was deleted ) to others? it's so ridiculous , and if there was an ability to delete our messages without time limited it would be a really really good app. cause it will prevent every mistake and quarrel between friends. 😁😐",2
com.whatsapp,Ahsan,This app is now a bulls**t. Last update turned on ads on WhatsApp which is highly non professional. I thought it's a personal app with no ads. But I think your personal data isn't safe anymore and ads literally suck. I was typing a text and in between ads started I thought I'm gonna throw this phone to wall. Probably gonna uninstall it very soon.,1
com.whatsapp,Saidul Islam Palash,Backup and restoring system is very poor. It also occupies huge amount of internal storage🙁. When backup process starts you can't use this app. If you uninstall and reinstall the app it will take a long time (decade 😕) to restore the backeup!!,1

Its hard for me to to my job like this. This happened after i update it a few days ago. Before this all is good,1
com.whatsapp,Mithlendra Atul,I just want to share an suggestion which i think is obvious that WhatsApp should enhance the quality of the profile picture that is being uploaded by the user. The first appearance is the DP that anyone goes for. And that is blurry whether you've a high resolution picture. But after you upload it it becomes like a 144p or even lower than that. Please update that in next update.,4

com.whatsapp,Victor Chett,"For the past few weeks, every morning the ""Something went wrong with your chat history"" message pops up. Have to force stop the app when it gets to 44% from 40% to restore chat (sometimes at 39% from 35%). Unreliable and unnecessary to have to do this every morning.",1

com.whatsapp,Angee Relf,You're updating the app and its not for the best! I understand the need for bug fixes and security but why take away/remove options within the app which help the user? Pop up notifications for example? I'm looking into a better messaging g option as I don't agree with your updates ie making a decision on my behalf as to what I can or can't use within the app.,1
com.whatsapp,aeortiz2004 Instructor,I was trying to install this app in another phone of mine and apparently the algorithm interpreted my intention as some sort of improper action. In multiple occasions I was asking for the code by sms and call but it didn't respond. Finally I give up with this and installed another app similar and easily as this one. Finally I've received the code. That make me change this review to 2 stars since it took almost 2 weeks to have the code. And in fact I lost the previous chats.,2
com.whatsapp,Vortex Max,"Bad App, after an update, when I read a chat if screen gets into screen saver, the app will go to end of chat , sometimes I have hundreds of masseges at one group, I can't read all of them, every time the screen will go in the screen saver mode, the app will go end of chat,, very stupid update.",1

com.whatsapp,nemichand verma,One of the bad setting in whatsapp is archived chats are showing in the top most position. As we want to hide it from that tab to be shown up but its already showing on top. I personally dont like this setting. Archived chat can be placed at bottom.,2

Kudos to the innovative development team.,4

Poll Tab (Dissapearing) When a poll is created, make a tab to appear for example on top of the mic tab. It can be dissapearing depending on creator's time set",5

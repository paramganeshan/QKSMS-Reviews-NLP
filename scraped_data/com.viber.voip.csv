com.viber.voip,Mr. Smooch,"Pretty great app for chatting and video calls. I also like all the free sticker packs and use them all the time with friends. Probably too much but eh, they're unique. I especially like using the app while traveling as it works just as fine when connected to wifi as it does on data or in better depending on connection strength. Has some adds but easy to mute or ignore those.",5
com.viber.voip,Olya Andersen,"I like the app overall. I have been using it for YEARS! For about a month or so when someone sends me a picture, my notification bar shows the Viber Icon with ""downloading media"" message until I restart the phone. This is annoying because I dislike having false notifications. It makes me want to keep checking my phone.",4
com.viber.voip,A Mack,It was my favorite app since it began but in last two years or so it went down hill to a performance level that makes it useless for any form of communication. Video chat quality is horrible ( pixelized and very choppy) even at messured internet speeds over 100 mb/s on both ends! Calls often don't go through and annoying soud that happens when you add a heart to the message can't be muted! After last update info about missed calls is not displaying on chat screen! What is going on with this app?,1
com.viber.voip,Lorik Bejta,"The most recent update has made it so that only pictures from the Viber folder are displayed and can be sent; if you want to send any other pictures, you'll need to open the gallery, select the picture you want to send, press the share button, select the Viber folder, select the contact, and then send the picture individually. Makes no sense at all; I'll stick with one star 🌟 until this is corrected.",1
com.viber.voip,SE V,"Horrible new update. There is no more option to choose any image from your gallery. The only folder is available it's a viber folder. Looks like a lot of people hate this update. And a meaningless answer from Viber customer service ""It's not an issue, you just need to make some extra steps to send pics or video"" YES. IT'S A HUGE ISSUE. I wish I could give 0 stars. It looks like people who create new and stupid updates they never use an app themselves.",1
com.viber.voip,Ronda May,Edited: The app doesn't seem to be able to stay live. Will say someone is online but when I close and reopen the app it says they haven't been online for a while. I'm a heavy user of stickers which are severely limited and static and I set a custom sound for each contact to be able to know whether I need to attend to the chat or not. This feature is not available in Viber it seems. Also used to responding to chats with a lot more emoticon options than the 5 offered in Viber.,3
com.viber.voip,Dan Cristea,"I have been using viber since the beginning. Unfortunately nothing has changed regarding the quality of the phone calls. Even if you have 5G full antenna, or you are on wifi, the phone calls are so bad that you can't have a 2 minute conversation. It always says that the connection is Poor. Why is this still happening after so many years?? Whatsapp and Messenger are far more superior on quality of the phone calls. Am afraid I'll have to switch.",1
com.viber.voip,Weissenburg Medizin,"Couple of years ago this was my favorite app. Not any longer, since they introduced Viber Lenses. This thing is useless to me, but l can't uninstall it, and a fresh install brings on a nag screen. When making a photo in a hurry, I often press on the lense and not on the photo button, which flips the camera and ads an idiotic filter. I've contacted support, they did not bother to reply.",1
com.viber.voip,Belejebkaan A,"I've used Viber for years. It use to be a great app. Unfortunately, it has gone downhill. The biggest problem I have is message lag. This happens on data and wifi connections. The lag in the message delivery ranges from a few minutes to as long as overnight. My friend and primary contact is experiencing the same problems. The program is up to date. I have even uninstalled viber and reinstalled a fresh copy. Unfortunately, that has also not fixed the problem. Time to move on!",1
com.viber.voip,deezspizzeek,"The app is good, except the part where--the incoming call-can't seem to pick it up(responding I meant, pressing answer button). The button doesn't work, so I had to call the person back right away after waiting for the incoming call to end. There is other issues where when I call the person, and the phone speaker aren't turn on. The person cannot hear what I'm saying unless I put the speaker on.",4
com.viber.voip,•Ari G•,"The app is good, I love the stickers, but there's one problem that I just can't seem to fix. For some reason, Viber takes forever to send my messages. Sometimes, I have to wait up to 10-15 minutes until my message sends. Sometimes, it doesn't send at all. And this is not a problem with my internet because everything else works, including other texting apps I have that require internet.",3
com.viber.voip,UltraLord_64,"Extremely buggy, constantly doesn't send messages when you think it did. Constantly unable to connect to wifi when everything else can and I even have Verizon gigabit connection. The app then tries blaming my wifi connection when I have 300mbps... You'll get frequent fraudulent texts also. edit: still horrible. it will say sent but not actually send anything. if viber is looking for any software devs, I will gladly make this a usable app!",1
com.viber.voip,Luka Todorovic,"And what about being in a call, and when I leave it, cannot come back again into it? To turn it off, to turn on camera, to pause mic... all these options are not possible because once I leave a call, there is no ""call notification"" to re-enter the call... Awful functionality, good job at being really the worst. Used to be a decent app until you tried emulating whatsapp and what not. All your updates were awful.",1
com.viber.voip,Yordan R.,"Very unreliable. Great concept in theory but the execution is lacking. Frequent interruptions, the other caller and I are unable to hear or see each other despite good internet connection. When called, I need to unlock the phone, open the viber app and ONLY THEN can I answer. This is very cumbersome and leads to missed calls. Many friends of mine use the app and I guess I'm stuck with it to stay in touch, but the sketchy quality it offers is disappointing.",2
com.viber.voip,Deepika Rachael Naidu,"Viber is a great app to connect with people around the world, especially keeping up in day to day messaging. However, i don't know but seems like there's a bug fix needed. I've encountered this problem many times. I get to see a ongoing call notification in my notification panel when I'm not on call and from a contact whom i haven't contacted for days. The notification shows that i have a ongoing call for hours and hours, even when I'm not on the app. Viber keeps freezing, crashing too.",4
com.viber.voip,Vans T.,Often laggy and delays on sending out/delivering messages which obviously is a total hassle. Call quality is also an issue most of the time. 😭 Though I like how crisp the images/vids being shared and that you can do word search within a conversation. Hope there'll be an option to jump to certain date's thread for easy backreading.,2
com.viber.voip,Sofia Sereti,"Not able to take calls, it just keeps ringing even after clicking on ""answer"". If someone is lucky enough to get a video call through, the camera turns off suddenly without the person knowing (cam on the small screen which displays yourself is still on, but the other person cannot see you)! Cannot add a person to a group chat, even though we both have each other saved on our contact lists and even though numerous group chats have already been created between us in the past! No logic whatsoever!",1
com.viber.voip,M. D. Jolley,"Utter garbage. The only reason I use it is because I'm forced to by some companies that I buy things from. The application will not update itself like other apps do, and if it has a problem with backup, you're stuck with the notification until you restart your phone. It's pretty much the worst chat app and doesn't even come close to Telegram... Which is so good, I pay a monthly subscription plan for extra features. Get it together, Viber.",1
com.viber.voip,zeynep gunal,"When I first installed the app I wasn't able to send messages. Eventually after 2 months I received the notifications that my messages did not get sent. One of the suggested remedies was to reinstall it. That's what I did, and now my phone number does not get verified - the wheel keeps turning. Update: And now I get activation failed message! Because my number is registered as spam?!",1
com.viber.voip,Misa Maric,"Viber is an great app. I like it a lot but there is one nasty bug which is not fixed for a long time now! Many time, when someone is calling you, Viber doesn't ring at all. Instead is staying quiet or in the best case scenario you get message notification about missed call. This is not an issue on my phone, it's an issue which all my friends and family have too. So this is the reason I am giving 3 stars for this app. I hope this bug will be fixed soon.",3
com.viber.voip,RM !,"OK, I've used viber for years and have had a few problems along the way but since this last update this is the worst I've ever seen in any of the apps I use. No notifications are coming through, no sounds at all even though I've checked my settings and they're accurate. Doesn't ring when called... I'm in a different country than my family and I rely on this. I hope this is fixed soon. I literally have to open viber to see any notifications! I missed a message from my son by days due to update!",2
com.viber.voip,CH,"I don't know what is happening, it used to be a very good app, but Viber is behaving strangely recently, it started to translate "":)"" smilies from different iconset, that I don't like, it does not ring, just notify about missed call, does not ring my amaze fit watch, and the bluetooth headset stopped working with it :( quite a bunch of disappointments.",2
com.viber.voip,Dilsha Devadas,"The last seen and online status are not accurately updating. Always viber shows online even after the person already left the chat. This delay makes confusions. Kindly check the problem and minimise the delay of updating the app to new time. Most of the time last seen is not correct. Viber shows a random time in which app hasn't opened at all. In case of online status, the status remains ""online"" after the person left the chat. This randomness in time makes discomfort.",2
com.viber.voip,Gus Hayabusa,"Update: Where did the download option from within media (like a photo) go??? We don't want either all media to go to our gallery or none. We want to individually download media received. First the sticker UI, now this. Why are you making our lives more difficult? Change should come with improvement. Stop making changes just for the sake of updating. You will lose even the most faithful of users if you continue to mess with things that were fine and needed no change. Stick to necessary changes.",2
com.viber.voip,Risa Nakayama,"Love the app, but I have had to uninstall the new version and return to Version: 18.5.1.0 (651041). The new version only shows the names of the people who are in your contact list. If they are not in your contact list, the mobile number is reflected. I saw that this was an issue others were experiencing and got the version to download to fix this issue. Hope the new version can be fixed.",5
com.viber.voip,In The Now,"I just hope that the app's next update includes automatic log out on the last conversation. When you open the app sometimes it goes directly to the last conversation with someone or a group and if you are non-observant and very quick on mesaaging, you will chat to the wrong person or group. So it's important that there is an automatic log out from the last conversation to avoid wrong sent. Replicate Messenger.",3
com.viber.voip,JM Garcia,"It is buggy, specially on the notification icon, it seems laggy, it is displaying retrieving always, this should have a time out time in programming, if within 10 sec, data is not receive it ahould display off, and then put the notification again if message is received. It puts the user to always browse because the message might be important. I always force stop the app and clear cache but it does not work. Im really disappointed but we are just users, we cannot do anything unless we are paying",2
com.viber.voip,Mamta Malpani Saboo,"The app is amazing and has some very interesting features. But off late I am facing weird issues like inspite of my msg preview and notifications turned on, I do not get to see msgs directly on my mobile screen. I need to go to the senders chat to read the msg, which was not the case earlier. 2. There is also lag in receipt of msgs from any sender to me. 3. I saw few of my friends online at odd hours on the app, however they being my room mate I knew they were not using the app at those hours.",5
com.viber.voip,Bob S,"Once a Good app. Simple function, simple to use and reasonably effective. Now it is suffering bloat. The desktop version gives you no control over updating & the app is now an over complex thing that takes up too many resources due to all the useless gimmick add-ons like lenses. Calls often have poor quality audio & drop out on a frequent basis. Recieved message reporting can be very inaccurate with messages reported as recieved & they have not been. Reliability is key - Viber isn't any more",1
com.viber.voip,Dheeraj Dheeru,"The online status/last seen status in the app is malfunctioning. It's showing a person is online even if the app has not been opened. Same with the last seen status as well. It's showing a person was seen 5 mins ago, 10 mins ago, when clearly they were not on the app at mentioned times. Please fix it in the next update.",3
com.viber.voip,R Ali,Good app for calls & messaging. But recently I am having an issue where my Viber is backed up & it shows on my notifications panel so I try clicking on it to see its process or clear from notification but no use so phone needs to restart.another problem is with sticker market. Before i could access sticker market and download them but now i try just opening Sticker market it doesn't open and keeps on saying Loading. I don't mind buying the stickers individually so Please fix the issue....,4
com.viber.voip,Olha Stefanova,"The app is OK, but I've recently struggled a lot while trying to restore my message history on Android phone. Although I have everything I need in Viber Desktop on PC, I couldn't make a backup to Google cloud or synchronize it with my phone without loosing messaging history. It is really frustrating that the phone and desktop versions are that much decoupled:(",3
com.viber.voip,Nightmaremh Prince,"When you download pictures and videos as a ""file"", it gets downloaded as blank 0 kb files. Have to click download at least 10+ times to finally get the picture or video downloaded. Gallery gets filled with hundreds of useless 0 kb blank pages, just to get 10 pictures or videos recieved as file. Please fix this and its been around for 2 years now. Stopped using viber cause of this only. Uninstall and clear cache+data and phone restarts didn't fix it. Updating my this review from 2020 now.",1
com.viber.voip,Android Account,"Attention: Battery drain continues even with the latest version. Initially the problem started with version 17 i believe. I was hoping the latest version will fix it, but problem persists. I tested on diferent Andriod versions - 8 and 12, on different phones. In all cases when Viber is active, it becomes slowly the largest consumer of battery. I tested by removing the app and battery drain stops. Battery will last less than 1 day with viber otherwise ~ 2 days.",1
com.viber.voip,Summer Shivani,Quite a good app. Is it possible for the notes section to have reminders which can be set for other contacts.Like an outlook meeting reminders kind of feature...So if i have a meeting with someone in my contacts...the reminder at the allocated time can ring/play a sound on both our app.This will be amazing I think.,4
com.viber.voip,Janavi Gowda,It's been terrible to use viber app nowadays. Everytime I start to msg it hangs a lot and it's shows app not working. Whenever I get an update and do it but still there is no improvement at all. I see all the reviews given by everyone it's not only my issues but still this is happening with many of them...,1
com.viber.voip,Ashley Anthony,"I can't use the app since the update. I thought being unable to add pictures was a glitch so, I Uninstalled and reinstalled. Now, it doesn't let me do anything except register a new number. I don't have the option to log in on mobile. When I sent support an email, I received a response saying to give it up to 12 hours to send me an activation code. I DON'T NEED THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT ACTIVATING ANYTHING. I'M JUST TRYING TO LOG IN! Their support keeps sending me nonsense and won't listen.",1
com.viber.voip,Sujan A.,After the latest update. Last seen for the profile is not showing properly even if the user is not online it shows online and the behaviour is same in last seen too. Randomly it shows last seen 4 min ago or 10min ago. These are the basic functionality that should work properly. Please figure out the issue. Thanks,3
com.viber.voip,Steve Miller,"Online status is wrong constantly. For the past 2 days when I would video call my family , sometimes they would receive my call other times not. Sometimes the missed call would show up several minutes afterwards. The online status would say they were just online and actually they weren't. Because we would be talking using another app. I checked for any updates I might have missed. None. My phone is up to date. So we both restarted our phones and still the same issues. Missed calls, no phone rang",2

com.viber.voip,Pera Bozic,It's a pretty good app. And they have support which actually answers emails. That's nice and refreshing given it is a free piece of software. I dare you to try the same with Meta (FB) or Microsoft (Skype). That's really big and why they are my choice to stay. :-),5
com.viber.voip,Victoria Tuong,"""Hide chat"" feature that archives the chat instead of locking it would be nice.

Surely that means it is saved somewhere. Why are the not synced?",1

com.viber.voip,Lida Chondropoulou,This is one of the best apps for texting it has filters and lots of fun and great features.it also has games and you can create groups and your own stickers.furtheremore it has good action but one improvement is in the games you have to invite people to play the game in order to continue in some games over all great though. And it also has free GIFs and has lots of ways to express your emotions with your friends.i also love visiting the sticker market to get the new stickers they make every week,4

It used to be annoying to be in the middle of a voice message and lose it entirely due to any interruption, like an incoming call, or an accidental dial BUT this was corrected lately so the message is still there waiting to be sent. This is an improvement I am very happy about. We still experience ""losing the other one"" during voice calls though.",4

Awful!",2

I CAN'T EVEN CONTACT ANYONE HUMAN TO TALK TO. JUST ABSOLUTE TRASH.,1
com.viber.voip,siberian indian,"Well, Viber's low security precautions lead to so many fraudulent calls I receive from random numbers these days. It is way too easy for fraudsters from one country to get a local number in another country and start abusing Viber-Out feature. And unfortunately, Viber does not provide regular users to block unwanted calls. I only want to receive calls and chats from people that are in my address book, nobody else.",1

Very disappointing,1

com.viber.voip,TAUHID KHAN,"I've been using the App from the very beginning and ever since I'm quite satisfied with it. Love this app and it's on the top of my list of the Massaging services. Very good performance except for the calling response where many of the times the response on the other end is found to be ""Calling"" rather than ""Ringing"" in which you establish a call whereas if it's displayed ""Calling"" the call on the other end not connected. Other than this, it's quite an Awesome app. All the very best.",4

com.viber.voip,Donald Mccraw,Been using Viber for a decade. Frustrating because every time I turn around ad's popup with no way to Delete. Viber is constantly offering a subscription and I already have one. Can't get out of that one either. I just want to be left alone unless I ask for something or help.,2
com.viber.voip,Meg,User Names not showing since l reinstalled it. It used to show the Viber account owner's name even if theyre not saved as a contact. Now theyre just showing phone numbers! I deal with several people in groups on a daily basis and its hard to keep track of conversations in groups when i dont see their Profile Names. Whats happened???,2
com.viber.voip,Arthur Rogers,Viber is very useful for travellers those with international friends. The in app translation makes a real difference and makes conversations much more natural. The notes function and ability to run on phone and computer simultaneously is very good from a work perspective. The Viber Out option is also a reasonably priced option for international calling.,5

After updates on my android and viber, my conversations in viber only shows the contact numbers of people not in my contacts instead of the public names they use. My viber for desktop is just fine. I am in a profession that many people not in my contacts are messaging me and needs to know who I am talking to. I have contacted viber support but there was no reply",1
com.viber.voip,Somayaj Chaitanya,Customer support is very hard. I swapped my mobile and phone numbers. Later I can't send and receive messages. So I deactivated my account and later tried reactivate it which says access failed. Trying to reach customer support they never reply.,1

com.viber.voip,Animation Echo,"Overall a great messaging app. I've used Viber for years and it has mostly worked very well. One of the things that make Viber so good is how it is encrypted, so only you and your message recipients will be able to see what you send. You can even make messages that dissapear after a certain period of time (and that you can't screenshot whatsoever). Because of that though, the app relies on your own phone to store all photos and chats, so Viber might become heavy on your phone overtime",5

I can also delete any messages for everyone that I sent to whenever I want. Love the syn function between phone and computer, it's easier to type up messages on laptop than your phone. Might need to work on the viber out feature as the rate is inconsistent depending on method of payment.",4

I gave them every detail including screenshots but how is it possible to lock your old customers out like this. I love the app for privacy reasons but there has to be a way for me to prove the system that it's still me! I've been using the same number for 22 years! SAD!",1
com.viber.voip,Berjun Tiu,How should displaying full contact numbers instead of names/nicknames protect your user's privacy? Because that's the only thing (mobile numbers) scammers would need to directly contact and scam you. Had to uninstall and revert to older version. 🤦,1
com.viber.voip,Daniel Anishchenko,My account has been banned from sending messages a second time by the automated spam system even though I have not sent any spam. Viber is not safe to use for anything buisness related or important. Use any other platform. Support is impossible to contact since you always receive a automated message letting you know that viber has blocked you and won't respond to communications. This is a zero star app.,1

com.viber.voip,Joey Carlo Sy,"All good on the mobile app. Its the desktop version that has a problem. Every time you have updates, likely every week, the app just crashes everytime I try to run it.

I HAVE to use viber because of my school chat. I recommend everyone to switch to telegram.",1
com.viber.voip,M F,"So inconvenient to use now. Viber why not show profile names on group chat? when in the first place you will not be added to the group if you are not officially part of the group or recognized by the institution right?

However the desktop version is somewhat unwieldy... frequent hang times, not syncing properly, slow to respond, etc. But what's annoying mostly is pop up messages from advertisers and hard to delete group chat ads from foreign intruders, especially when they post lewd ad messages.

However, still, there are some inconveniences, for example, if I need to scroll up the conversation quickly to the very beginning (in the community, individual chat), that's not possible to do very quickly on most smartphones expect for iPhones.

com.viber.voip,Diana Carrodus,Last few months keeps cutting out after 30 secs or a few minutes. This started when you introduced the adverts. I have used this app for years to talk to my daughter overseas.

Now you can't send the normal emoji as it was because it automatically changes to the one built-in with Viber. I don't prefer viber's emoji's, so I would like to ask you to change it.",3

com.viber.voip,A Google user,"Hate some awful features of it. Because there is no option of editing sent message, so you must delete this message and write it again. For the second, I hate that: you find that someone called you few times, you click on it to see the time of calling, you do it again and again and get used to it. SO, if it was only one call, you click on it again and CALL BACK instead of looking at the call information, like you used to do. Do anything with this, pls.",2

com.viber.voip,A Google user,For the last few days I've not been receiving notifications until I load the app up onto the screen. I have made no changes to the settings and I have even checked all the battery saving/notification/access settings to ensure there's no issue. I even uninstalled and reinstalled and the problem returned. I believe a recent update has caused this issue. I hope this can be fixed ASAP as I found Viber to be a very good alternative to WhatsApp.,3
com.viber.voip,Daniel Inhauser Mesojedovas,"I have been used Viber for years, it is my go-to app to talk to friends and family. However, it's gone down from a 5 star to a 4 star application. The two main reasons being the removal of a few features and the ever increasing presence of ads. Come on, showing ads among my 'chat rooms'? Showing ads even when navigating menus? It's getting too intrusive, and as other similar apps seem to be improving their PC connectivity, it won't take long before I switch to other options that won't put ads among my conversations!",4

com.viber.voip,A Google user,The app has started to behave erratically after the latest update. The biggest problem is the app telling me that it can't connect to Viber service since I don't have internet. This happens when I have a 4g high speed sim in my mobile and am connected to a 100mbps WiFi connection. Restarting the phone has no effect. 19 out of 20 times I get this issue. The other pestering issue is the app being unresponsive. I select something and the click is registered several seconds later. What a shame!!!,1

com.viber.voip,evonne pavlides,Viber you are totally unprofessional. How can someone maliciously report another user because they dislike them and Viber asks for no evidence and doesn't even inform the user that they gave been reported.

There is a bug that enters random numbers that will not clear when backspacing. It only works when you copy and paste the number. Which does not matter anyways because you wont receive the activation code that youre hoping for- not evem via phone call. The worst part is the cs support ticket system who just repeats the same auto message and closes your ticket even after providing screenshots.,1

com.viber.voip,Nathalie G,I truly appreciate how easy this app is and how many options it offers to you. The only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is because when I drive and talk through Viber I get calls dropping more often than on the other app while driving through a zone with low wifi. Yet the other apps don't offer the flexibility that Viber does! Thank you so much for the app!,4

It's easy to use and doesn't take up much resources or bandwidth if you want to use it for phone calls and video chats. As you can tell I am very happy to have found this app.,5
com.viber.voip,Kat Turingan,"Apr28: 2 days with no more crashes. Thanks! Apr 24: On Viber I could not send text and photo messages the other day. The next day, still could not send. So i uninstalled the app and downloaded again. Now the app keeps closing :(",5
com.viber.voip,A Google user,"I preferred the previous version where it showed me whether the message had been 'delivered' or 'seen""...now it just shows ticks. It's has also changed the colour of my msgs and shrinks photos to the size of previous msg. Why did you change it?",4

com.viber.voip,Dorina Elena Pavel,Love this app while using when talk with my foreign friends. You changed Google translate with Azure. The way I am receiving translation its ridiculous. Really??

com.viber.voip,Helen T.,"I deleted it from my phone because I had to clear up space and used it from my tablet and laptop. Some time after it deactivated my account and it tells me to scan the code with my viber on my phone so I tried to install it, cleared up space, started downloading only for it to tell me that it cannot be installed. Same for my tablet. I put in my phone number and it made a new account. I lost all my contacts. Very disappointed. I also had some issues with viber before the account deactivation.",1

I tried to search for hidden chats but didnt find anything. From what I know I dont have any hidden chat. Any suggestion please? Thanks",5
com.viber.voip,Anthony Elder,The only problem I have is when Viber will not connect to mobile data and requires a wifi connection. That's very frustrating because it happens frequently and takes time for it to correct itself.,4
com.viber.voip,Karen Gregorio,One of my favorite messaging App. Keeps on improving and rarely freezes! Thank you!,5

com.viber.voip,Vince Somera,Awesome app! Very easy to use. I've been using Viber for many years since the early days it was created and it has always been a pleasant & fun experience using this app - every time! It's my default messenger! And it has a desktop computer version as well - genius! I hope it will always stay the same and not get ruined by major changes or unnecessary upgrades (like the other apps that I already uninstalled). Thank you for such a wonderful & super nice app... high fives to the developers!,5

com.viber.voip,Ghil Cacho,Thread pictures are saved locally and will be shown on my local gallery. Other apps don't do this. Either they have temp files that kept hidden or different format. Its annoying browsing local gallery and pictures coming from this app mixed up.,4
com.viber.voip,Mr. Blue,awful. another app that requires other people to have the app too. this requires you to be an app salesman to your friends and none of my friends want Viber. why can you not text them if they are not on it? I know your answer is security but shouldn't you leave that to the end user? this app is a waste of space unless you find someone that's willing to change their texting app and that is just stupid thinking on the developers part. force someone to convince their friends. ridiculous.,1

Put back the secret chat, cause this is not usefull at all....or...keep the self destruct messages and bring back the secret chat also.",1
com.viber.voip,Emanuel Rotten,Frustrated ☹️ You can't use this app without providing access to all contacts. Other messengers allow to add contact one by one without exposing all contacts which not always like to be exposed. One cannot use virtually any feature of the app without letting it know who you are familiar with.,1

com.viber.voip,A Google user,"Viber, in case you are listening please note special request for future development:  We need the ability to search within a chat for words or dates or etc. You may be happy to know that due to some privacy concern we dumped whats app in our company and we tend to ask other companies to connect with us through viber. Some of our managers have dumped email because they are finding viber more immediate and easier to use with file sharing etc. However, for example, when we need to recall agreements from a month ago, it is very hard if not impossible to bring that part of the ongoing chat up. I was able to do this with competitors. So in respect of a project or property we just searched that and came to the useful part of the chat.

com.viber.voip,Call me Sinderella,Very bad app. I don't recommend to install the app. I know the app is for free so viber needs to sell data to companies but why bots? Being added to strange group chats by bots in the middle of nowhere is just annoying!!!! Why do you allow bots on Viber and sell private information - private phone numbers (!!!) - to the people behind them???!!! It's so sad. I hope you will fix this problem soon. I once enjoyed the app.,1
com.viber.voip,A Google user,App is very good. But please can you make a button that i can choose to save my pictures not directly to gallery?? Everytime when someone send a pic and i open it automatically save to gallery? With one button problem can be solved? Thank u,4
com.viber.voip,Angelica Nikole B. Casio,My contacts didn't see any of my messages and there's always a clock icon under my messages so they didn't see my messages. And when I'm doing a video call the audio is always cracking in both lines. What happened?,1
com.viber.voip,molly wee,The app is great but every once in a while the app starts to send me notifications for messages only when i enter the app and i already tried to fix it by uninstalling viber and installing it again but i would be fine for a few days and it would do the same thing i would really like to fix that problem,4
com.viber.voip,A Google user,"hi Viber team...ur work is great ...but the only thing that u had made a bed change in it is when u replace ""delivered"" ""seen"" with those ""✓""""✓✓"" ...plase get back to original delivered and seen until we can know the status of the messaging... another point is when we made a call and the contact cut off the call ...viber doesn't notify as and still continue ringing . thank you for all .",4

It is handy and it dies the job but not very well .,3

com.viber.voip,Alan Olav Walker,Viber is one of the favourite app. But i gave you 4 Stars. Reson : We cant send private messages in the app. I mean we cant send messages without show number. If we send message they are always chat with us. And if we block them after they use another number to chat me. This is the probleam im Faced. Other wise is good. I Love The app. ❤️💙🧡💚🤎💛.,1

com.viber.voip,Carmen Lam,I am very happy with your service. The only thing is that the emoji icons are limited and you could improve this? Line app has excellent icons and emoji appear as you type. They are fun and exciting. Viber icons seems out of date. 😳,4
com.viber.voip,f a,Quite the hassle with calls Closing the app while in a call can make it really hard to stop the call yourself. Had to ask the recieving person on the call to close it themselves so I could recall,1
com.viber.voip,A Google user,Used to be a 5 star but since the new update and removed the location attached in messages and no way to turn back on very disappointing. May try another app that has this feature been using viber for years. Why remove a feature you had the option of not using if you didn't want to. Now you cant. Unhappy,3
com.viber.voip,A Google user,Update: thank you for fix that . Original review 1 star:Explore function is annoying and useless. Keep just chat and call function. Force us see every time we open viber this explore tab is a waste of time for those who just want access fast their chats or make a call. You're destroying the app putting those useless option. Keep doing that and you will always be behind WhatsApp... keep viber simple. That will make more people use.,5

I specifically denied permissions to access my contacts during the installation, and yet the Viber spammed all my contacts that I've installed Viber. 1. I didn't allow it to access my contacts. 2. Why would a software send anything to my contacts without even notifying me about it? I'm not even talking about asking for my consent. Sure thing I'm uninstalling it. Hope Viber will send notification about that as well. It's not normal for software to do such things.",1

com.viber.voip,A Google user,"It's good all in all. But it requires a strong connection to make viber out calls and they don't work as good as they should. When you pay for something the expectation would be that it's in its highest quality possible, but viber or is far from it.",2

com.viber.voip,A Google user,***WARNING***WARNING*** do not use the viberout function. It charged me several times for calls that never connected. Also viberout does not work from certain countries. Egypt or UAE for ex. They never tell you this and just take your money. Find some other voip app that actually works..,2
com.viber.voip,Cam Loax,Viber is excellent; the feature I appreciate is being able to edit text after it has been sent and resend the text with the corrections. Whatsapp does not provide this capability.,5
com.viber.voip,Random GUY,"Seriously?? A notification appears saying ""return to viber"" and no matter how many times I click that , it just doesn't go away .

com.viber.voip,Svarte Natt,"Used to be my main messenger, but nowadays it gets so many useless features like News, Explore, etc. that take up space and RAM.

com.viber.voip,A Google user,I absolutely love the app. Easy to maintain connections with family when abroad. My only complaint is the notifications (in app) for new stickers....I wish rhere was a setting to deactivate the indicator.,5
com.viber.voip,Vixxi V,This overall is a great app when you want to communicate with people away from you and send pictures videos etc.... also it does not crash and cause any problems.,5
com.viber.voip,A Google user,I've been using this app off and on for a few years. It's gotten better but it still drops calls and is hard for what we use it for when my husband is deployed. It probably the wifi more than the app but it's works most of the time for us,4
com.viber.voip,Mihail Daskalov,relatively good app but bugs are bad. A problem just appeared with the last update (23.03.2021) - app crashing constantly. Previous review: but one bug is totally wrecking my experience - after going to power saving mode I have to reactivate viber and restore chat history from old backup (on samsung galaxy s6).,1
com.viber.voip,A Google user,"Since the last update, during viber calls I get notification sound every 3 seconds. I turned off option 'notification during calls' in my phone settings but this didnt solve my problem. Please help me with this or I will be forced to delete my Viber account.",1
com.viber.voip,M V Wexford,"This gotta be the worst chat app I have seen in a while. 1) The links for group chats provide zero information about the content, so you get spam links passed for legitimate groups. 2) There is no simple button for ""leave chat,"" either. Instead, you have to dig through the menus. 3) No button for ""report spam""--you have to send a message to support with a screenshot. So yes, if you want your time wasted with hundreds of notifications about some total garbage channels, go ahead and install Vibe.",1

com.viber.voip,A Google user,"Used to love this. Was so much nicer than Skype because it didn't require as strong of an internet connection to have good call quality.

com.viber.voip,John Davies,"Agreeing to Obscenely intrusive observation of everything you do and say is the only way to activate the app. F. OFF If I can't use it without having advertising databases about users then I'm out. Untargetted adverts or no users, you decide. No surprise that only two people I know use viber. I'll return with untargetted ads. Vile GDPR abuse, I selected ""manage ad preferences"" and after 10mins of scrolling I still hadn't got to the bottom to select non targeted adverts.Is there that option even?",1
com.viber.voip,A Google user,I'd give it no stars if I could. Since the update I can't send any messages and when friends send me messages they go red which indicates I have deactivated Viber which I haven't. I've tried to get help on the support site and that's absolutely rubbish.,1

But this last update is the worst ever. it has become so irritating and difficult to find GIFs now. It used to be so easy but this new update killed it.

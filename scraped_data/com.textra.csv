com.textra,Ivan Rodriguez,"I've been using this app for about 4 years now and it freaking ROCKS! Minimal ads that don't pop up to block your screen, they are small and only appear at the top, so they're VERY easy to ignore. You can set your messages to send with up to a 9 sec delay, in case you change your mind, it automatically blocks spam text messages from both phone numbers & email addresses, has a feature where you can schedule a text to be sent at set date & time. Also you can set group replies to come to you only.",5
com.textra,Alan Mihajlov,"I can't recall hw I stumbled across Textra. All I know is once I started using it, I couldn't see any reason to look elsewhere. It had great options and customization, and just got better and better. Love the new ""Keep"" feature - - ***very smart and handy!! *** They seem to keep working on making this better and better. Since I do a lot of texting (prefer that over emailing), I would love to see their own backup program built into the app where even selecting the txts (or contact/date range) pos",5
com.textra,Traci Williams,"I just found Textra and I'm really liking this app and the features!🙂 So, here's the problem. I have it on my phone (Galaxy S22), but it's not available for my tablet (Galaxy S7 FE). It would be great if I could sync my messages to my tablet so I'm not using so many electronics at once. PLEEEASE don't make me have to search for another sms app😥. It's hard trying to find a messaging app.",3
com.textra,Brent Spiker,"definitely an improvement over the stock messaging app that came with my phone. I have been using this app for multiple years now, and continue to stick with it. It has everything I need, and it is very customizable. I used to have issues sending pictures and long texts, although that was a couple phones ago. Those issues were why I tried Textra in the first place and I just really enjoy the layout and organization. 12/1/22: still my go-to messaging app! Love the updates and features.",5
com.textra,S L,"I've been using this app for a few years now and it's really a great app. It does have ads but they can be set at the bottom of your screen (though sometimes they appear in the middle of your list of conversations) but love the customizable features, the ability to send an emoji response to messages, and their customer service is quick to answer questions. Highly recommend.",5
com.textra,Destiny Floyd,"This has been my favorite texting app for years! Past few days when I try to send a picture, after I select it, it goes into the text thread, but then quickly disappears and turns into an explanation point. Please get this fixed...I switched to the Samsung messaging app in the meanwhile, which hardly compares to Textra when it's working properly.",3
com.textra,Jessica D'Andreamatteo,"The best texting app but a bit glitchy lately. The ability to click links disappears intermittently, there is no consistent fix for this. I keep getting ""textra isn't responding"" popups while the app is functioning fine. The developers are great & go out of their way to help w/ troubleshooting. I'll update the rating when there's a fix for the links not working. Things that don't fix it: ""reset permissions"", restarting phone, clear cache, update ""system WebView"", force stop, un/reinstall, etc.",3
com.textra,Ash B,"I've used this app for years and it just keeps getting better and better! The only issue I currently have is the underlined date/time text - it used to work on my app so I could schedule appointments and events, but not I only get the ""copy"" and ""share"" options. It was really helpful for me because I always forget about events, I hope to see it fixed soon!!",4
com.textra,Ed Crain,"Update: I'm now about 2 years in. This app is consistently updated with useful features. The most recent is a feature that keeps personal notes just like a text you might send but using 'keep' as the destination, it will just keep it local like a text -without sending it anywhere remote. Older: I've been using Textra for several months now and am perfectly satisfied with the look, process, and options. I especially like scheduling a text to send later. Use the info text bot to learn tips.",5
com.textra,Renee B,THE best! Easy to use. All the functions I need or want. Updated regularly with all the best improvements. TextraBot tells me so ! I've been a loyal Textra user for a while (more than 2 years). I've supported the developers by getting the ad-free version and I've never had any regrets. They do a great job! I've installed on every phone. (Samsung) It's so much better than the factory message app! I especially love the ability to schedule the messages!,5
com.textra,Shawn Adamson,"Update 3: resync and removing battery restrictions seems to have worked. Wish dev had suggested that instead of blaming my carrier. Update 2: sent support email, but no response yet. I see another review with the same issue I have, but we have different carriers. Both our issues started around the same time. After an update. So which is more likely the issue? Dropped another star for being dismissive. Update: I can no longer send images through the app. That's a deal breaker.",4
com.textra,Miranda Bolden,"I've been using textra for years and love it. The personalization is beyond compare: colors, conversation icons and colors. There have been some hiccups along the way, and I have tried to like other texting apps; I just keep coming back to this app. it has the options and functionality I like. Can't go wrong.",5
com.textra,Anthony C,"It's unique and has many options and features, which will get confusing, especially for beginners. I like to see unread messages in BOLD and a way to mark read messages as unread. Their email support response time is quick, and the answers are improving. The 1-time purchase price for the pro version is pretty fair.",5
com.textra,Rhonda Edwards,"What I love about Textra is I can insert a picture of my own or a Gif exactly where it fits in with my text. If I send a caption with a picture, it loses its meaning if it doesn't send with that picture. Other texting apps are inferior when it comes to that feature...and that feature alone will keep me with Textra...even though I enjoy it for other reasons, too.",5
com.textra,R Sutton,"I loved this app for several years. Lately, when I send texts, I receive failure notices. This is so f'ing ANNOYING!!! 🙄What's the issue with this recently occurring??! Yes, the cache is cleaned daily, so please don't go there. I'm pretty tech savvy and there's absolutely no excuse. Please, find a fix!!! Good Lawd!! 🤬",3
com.textra,Daren Kelly,"Textra had been the best texting app for myself personally as it has everything I needed but I also like to use Phone Link a lot especially at home and at work. Lately Textra will not sync with Phone Link no matter what I do to try and fix it. I'm hoping this will be fixed sooner rather than later. It seems every update seems to break something and after paying for Textra, I feel after all this time using it, I'm going to have to ditch it for something that just works with my needs.",2
com.textra,Rebekah Kaskubar,"I've had textra for years, bought the no ads option very early on. I love the customization of the app. Just recently I had an issue with my notifications not showing up. I reached out to textra because I noticed that there were lots of positive reviews about customer service. They weren't kidding! After a bunch of emails back and forth, Max helped me solve the issue (which wasn't even a textra issue). Super helpful, the whole experience helped me convinced my husband to switch over too!",5
com.textra,Paul Demesa,"Textra’s user interface is much better than other text/SMS app I’ve tried. The one thing that’s missing is the ability to block groups of senders, in my case, all messages not from my contacts. The last mid-term US elections are a good example. Many candidates were spamming my phone. Also I don’t understand why Textra has to be the default SMS app for it to work. The default SMS app that came with the phone does.",4
com.textra,Kira Boyle,"Standard texting app. Nice interface, nice customization options. It's easy to add new people to conversations, and I've had no issues with message sending. Almost finished up my trial when I found it has (what I think) is an amazing feature to export an entire text conversation and send it as an email. Dropped some $$ on pro support for that feature alone. A+ devs.",5
com.textra,D N,"Overall a very good texting app. Loss of star is due to no archive options. There are a lot of texts I don't need to see cluttering my list, but don't want to delete either. Also there really needs to be a block option for junk text. These items are what's stopping me from getting the pro version and pondering looking around for other text options.",4
com.textra,Erik Van Betuw,"Textra is feature-rich and they keep improving it. During political season I have been inundated with fundraising texts, from both parties by the way, 6-10 a day at times. Recently Textra rolled out a new feature where texts from anyone not on my Contacts list can have their text notifications turned off or muted - and it is a lifesaver! I loved the app before this but now I am a Textra stan for life. ,",5
com.textra,Jared S,"I have been using Textra for years, on two phones now. There are ads but honestly it wasn't too long before I just paid for Premium and removed them forever. The default messaging app on my old phone was a nightmare so I tried this and it's such a gamechanger I'm never going back. Also I never review anything... but this is a fantastic app!",5
com.textra,chopstix906,"The last few updates I've had a few issues. MMS messages (group texts) often fail. I can't clear notifications within the app even after I open the text. Installed multiple updates that haven't fixed the issue. Update: MMS is still not working for some messages. I get the neverending ""Can't get MMS"" error notification. This is still an issue months later with most up to date version and a new phone (S22 Ultra).",3
com.textra,dawn,"Like it enough to buy the NoAd version. Seems to smoothly connect with everyone. It's pretty and simple and my favorite communication app. ONE YEAR UPDATE:. Still using it, still loving it. it has updated nicely and worked great with a OnePlus 6T. It's now 11\2022. Still love it. Using it now on a Samsung S22. I liked to customize individual chats and contacts. Smooth operation, dependable. And, I like the new keep feature!",5
com.textra,Anthony Esposito,"Constantly running into issues on pro version of sending and receiving text. At least a few times a week I get unable to receive text. It was solid until a year or so back when I sent my first response. Seems that others are having the same issue. Would hate to move to another app, but this is looking more realistic. Update 9/15/2022 Whatever you are doing now Textra now, keep it up. I have not run issues lately and I wanted the rating to reflect the work you all have done.",4
com.textra,Tori DelliCarpini,"Been a loyal Textra user for years since Samsung got rid of the ability to customize text tones for individual contacts. Always been pleased with the performance, updates, compatability, ease of use, and customizable options. I'm running a Samsung S22 Ultra, and while there is currently an issue with not receiving texts, Textra support was quick to help. I received an email response to the problem in three minutes, and I'm waiting to see if it solved the issue. I'm still a big fan.",5
com.textra,Sara,"I have used many texting apps and this is by far the best... Every time I've tried another I come back to textra. It's easy to use, an intuitive design, and super customizable. I have the pro version now but I used the free version without issue for a long time before upgrading. Developers, please add more variety of notification icons! I love being able to tell who texted me when my screen is locked.",5
com.textra,Papa Smurf,"Textra does it right. They just added a new feature allowing you to control how unknown numbers are handled. The ""right"" part is that the default behavior is what was happening before the feature was added. I point this out since my default text editor at work seems to always turn on the new feature. This means I find the new feature by unexpected behavior and have to hunt down how to turn it off. Textra saves me the time and frustration. Good for them.",5
com.textra,Beth Barnes,"I've been using Textra for years with absolutely no issues until recently. I've reached out to support and for a week, I've heard nothing. My messages are not being received! I have to manually restart my phone and they dump in. I've checked all permissions, notifications, and everything is exactly the same as what it was a month ago when I had no issues. I have been having issues with MMS messages constantly failing, which is also annoying, but not receiving regular texts is a serious issue!",1
com.textra,Kathy Silberman,"I have been using Textra for awhile now and really like it's features. Recently I had a question and reached out to the developers. I received immediate assistance and full understanding of my issue. Honestly, when I reached out I thought it was a long shot I'd receive a response. The customer service was excellent. Textra is by far my choice for a messaging app.",5
com.textra,GoBlue Wolverine,"Have used Textra for several years and has always been a great texting option! Fast, easy, and customizable! One thing that has happened lately, if someone sends me a hyperlink to a video it gives me 3 options, Open, Copy, or Share. The copy and share options work, but the open button does nothing. I have to copy and then open it elsewhere, which is inconvenient. Any ideas?",4
com.textra,Mary Lynn McKenzie,Have used Textra for a long time and it has been great. The last week or so it has not been delivering my message without restarting my phone...daily... this is a problem because I use my phone e for work. If I can't straighten it out I will have to change to a different app. I have not changed anything on my phone and when I look at settings everything looks OK to me. Could use a little help here. Thanks!,4
com.textra,Sean Falbee,"Would give it a 5 star if it was compatible with watches.. At least for the read function.. Notifications are a bit funky initially.. Missed a few messages, which didn't cost me anything, but could have.. But customization is on point.. Lots of choice.. Edit: ummm. This is pretty good now that I've been using it . I really have no complaints .. I mean yeah.. honestly I don't know how to improve it There is one thing.. The voice to text recording . It keeps locking when talking.",5
com.textra,Jose Pazos-Perez,"Definitely the best messaging app for Android in my opinion. It was a game changer for me once I switched to an Android fairly recently. The native texting app and the Google app are just so laggy. I also appreciate how the developers are always keeping updates going and are very quick to provide feedback. Google is trying to add more features to their messaging app when Textra has already done it and more. This should be the native app for all Android phones. And yes, pay for the Pro Version.",5
com.textra,Mary John,"I've used Textra for years and love it. After a recent phone upgrade, I stopped receiving text notifications, despite notification settings being set up correctly. I reached out to the Textra team via email and they patiently walked me through a few potential fixes until the problem was solved. (For anyone dealing with the same issue, Android Settings > Apps > Textra > (Storage) [Clear Data] is what worked on my Samsung S22 Ultra.) I was blown away by the prompt, kind, helpful support. :)",5
com.textra,Jonathan Lopez,I have been using Textra for years when I was made aware of the app as a better alternative to Samsung text app. The features and options give you flexibility and functionality. However recently I have been experiencing sent fails when grouping text and MMS. It is quiet annoying especially when trying to send message that are time sensitive. Honestly I would like to see Textra fix the issues instead of having to go try the Google text app.,2
com.textra,Cody,"I've used Textra since 2013. It's got the best features, design, and UI for android phones on the market. Sadly, Textra has fallen behind in cross-device support. We're on Gen-5 of most smart wearables. It's pretty disappointing to have to choose between my favorite SMS app and using my wearable the way I bought it to be used. If you can provide that support, you're back up to 5 stars. I have to switch to Pulse SMS until then, don't let them keep me! You can still win the game! Just update:)",3
com.textra,Tatiana Vasilyev,"Been using this app for years. After the update, my texts are not coming through. Have to restart phone to get them. Have tried the defualt messaging app on my phone and my texts come through. Kind of sucks that I paid for the pro version of Textra and now it's not working. Really annoying. Don't know what the developers did to cause this after the recent update, but there is an obvious issue and it needs to be fixed please. Disappointed.",1
com.textra,Hypershell,"Great app with lots of customization options. I use it so I can assign unique alert sounds to specific contacts. However, it has one critical flaw: Spam and FRAUD from email accounts. You'd think it would be easy to auto-block texts coming from an email address and not an actual phone number (which no legit business does), but no such option exists. It should. I am tired of random email boxes trying to steal my bank info by claiming a card/account was frozen; this is a big security issue.",4
com.textra,Ellie Marciniak,"Easy to use and promise of secure messages made it my choice of texting app. My recent experience has been equal to my original first sentence herein. My complaint is lack of audible tones that announce a text delivery. Without the tone notification, I don't know that a text has come in to me. If it's because tones in Messenger would not transfer to Textra, I don't know a way activate any notification at all. Therefore I reduced my rating to four stars.",4
com.textra,Katie Lit,got it years ago to replace the samsung stock app when it stopped allowing you to assign ring sounds to the texts. i've been very happy with the app and the support team is top notch. they recently added a feature to help stop political text msgs so that's amazing. keep up the feature releases textra! worth the premium price/mo for a smooth user friendly experience.,5
com.textra,A.,"Was 5 stars until I discovered the pro version is $7.. I'd say it's more worth the $3 range, it's a text message app. It's got one main function.. I've switched back to Google Messages which does the same thing for free. REPLY TO DEV: There is no ""Manage Ads"" option in my app, I went through every single option. I also never said trial for features, I said trial until ads are displayed. <<They've since updated their app description..",2
com.textra,Don “MowerMan” Burgess,I've had this app for yrs and loved it. Now it stops after opening and goes back to home screen frustrating as hell. I've sent reports and big reports so many times I can't keep track anymore. I've uninstalled and reinstalled works for a minute then the same old thing. If not fixed I will be done with it. Which since I've had no help to this point I'm sure this review won't matter. But I look forward to your Bot automated reply like everyone else receives.,2
com.textra,F G,"This app works super well for sending and receiving text messages. NO ONE, not even Google messages or any other premium messaging app that I have used can handle the amount of pictures you can send at one time like TEXTRA does. Many things just happen in the background which is perfect. ONLY reason it is a four star is i feel the app should be more modern looking and fluid in its experience. Something more along the lines of FB Messenger or IG messages in prettiness but TEXTRA dependability.",4
com.textra,Sidd Gould,"Please add the ability to take a text and make it go to other apps like reminder apps with all of its information from the text .. also some type of Notifier when you get a text that stands out with a pop-up , No one tries harder to have a great app than this developer. Constantly updating it to make it state-of-the-art for all the different versions of upgrades and operating systems of the date on Android 12 which many apps are not. Keep up the good work you're appreciated",5
com.textra,C. H.M.,"Textra is, without a doubt, the best text app available. I've been using it for years and still nothing compares. It's updated regularly with very useful new features. The devs are very responsive whenever I've had a question, and the rare occasions when I've encountered an issue.",5
com.textra,Nichole Lodrigue,I love this app! It's the only app where I can customize not only the colors the notifications the icons. If I have any technical difficulties developer is quick to email me back with a solution. After lots of Android phones made it to where you can't customize notifications for individual contacts I tried many text apps and this one is by far the best!,5
com.textra,Vince Badovinatz,I really like the Textra app. It has a lot of nice features that the others don't. And it has features. that the other ones do have that are nice. Textra really does respond quickly if you have a problem. you can go right through the contact us portion and get a hold of them. they reply quite quickly.. It's a very good texting app I hope you guys like it. It's a great app,4
com.textra,Sean Gatton,"I know there's a problem with S22 Ultra receiving messages, so I know it's not Textra's fault: it can only show what the phone itself receives. Aside from that (which is not their fault), the experience is amazing. My one request is for you to make a WearOS version as well. The inability to set it on my Galaxy Watch 4 means if I want to use my watch to quick reply because my phone isn't near me, or in my pocket, I have to hard swap default SMS apps on my phone.",5
com.textra,ashley smith,"Good txt msngr app. Fast. Easy to use. So many ways to customize ! Sounds, colors of contacts, bubbles, led flash, icon for notification bar, etc. I'd been using another app since 2013, a Korean based one, and it stopped working Fri night and I switched to this. So happy I did! The copy ability, all or part, quick select most recent picture, ease of sharing, all top notch.",4
com.textra,Angela Ronkowski,"So, I have been using Textra for several years now. IMO Its about as good as it gets. Never had any problems. I've gotten rid of any and all msgs and media files or attachments that are not important or redundant. Kept about 150 msgs. I clear the cache often. The curious thing is that it takes up over 800mb (nearly a GB)of data in the internal storage. My phone only has 32 GB of storage. That's alot of resources. Is that normal or does that seem odd? Do you guys EVER respond to reviews?",4
com.textra,KC “KCGlobal” Corey,"WAS my Coolest, Best Designed SMS App. NOW (11/11/22) I can't text long texts, pics, emojis etc. NOR can I receive them. Used to. TCL phone updated before these issues happened. NOW only short texts sending and receiving. Cannot find where to change settings, either in App or phone. Too much time. Old: I have had many pre-installed and apps I've tried. I keep this one because it's got all the important and fun features that matters. Colors, styles, fun icons, reports and stellar support. Try it!",5
com.textra,Mike W,"A truly great app. Can't believe the customization options. Great work by developer and awesome support for issues! I highly recommend this app not just as a great alternative for Android users looking to circumvent data collection from Google's messaging app, but any user looking to add a level of customization to their messaging app that isn't possible with any of the other top messaging apps!",5
com.textra,Adam Colbert,"I recently got a new phone. I wanted a SMS/MMS app that WASN'T powered by Google! One quick read of the reviews convinced me that THIS is the texting app I'm looking for!!! Upon installing the app, no ""setup"" process required, all the previous messages/conversations seamlessly transferred over! I haven't even used the app ad I already feel good about it, ESPECIALLY after all the rock solid reviews I read!",5
com.textra,Coreen Hayes,"I loved the Verizon App before I got Textra. The reason I switched was because pictures were no longer sending for Verizon messages. I cleaned the app and did everything (right) just stopped working. I can send ten pics in a feed on Textra SMS and it all goes through. I am sure I will never switch again for as long as this app works like a charm, I will remain loyal!",5
com.textra,unbecoming2007 Truther,"Best text app out there, but fails bad in one of the most important areas - THE VERY TEXT U LOOK AT COUNTLESS TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY. For an app that is so customizable how is that we only get 3 FONTS ( Yes I said 3 ) to choose forever ? Makes zero sense to me. Almost everything has so many options to personalize yet FONTS ( HELLO, it's a textin app lol ), NOPE. NO FONTS FOR YOU. Wouldn't u think this very setting would come before almost everything in the "" customizing options "" dept ?",4
com.textra,Gina L.,"Unfortunately I had to go back to my default messaging app because this one wasn't working for me. It would fail to receive too many messages and if I accidentally clicked the ad on the top it would keep reopening until I restarted the app. If they can fix these issues, I would use it again because I like the customization features.",1
com.textra,KC Young,"Been using it for years but now messages will fail to send. Based on dev responses here I've reset my network several times and all it does is send a batch of messages and then goes back to failing. Please fix this, this is clearly an app issue. Even if it's a Samsung update issue like you are claiming, then it's your responsibility to make it work with the OS instead of just blaming Samsung.",1
com.textra,The1Ring,"Works well in all areas, no glitches so far. Very fluid and clean app. Pictures, emojis, gif all work. Would like to see more options for fonts e.g.cursive, comic sans etc. No Ads in app is temporary. The ads are not intrusive and doesn't bother me. I like the the updates which adds more features while making the current ones perform better.",5
com.textra,JDupree3,"A simple, wonderfully customizable app that handles mms and sms messages better than your stock app. Before I had the app, I would get problems with groups not working, issues with emojis, and missing pictures and gifs. This app smooths out the experience, fixing those problems, all while giving you the freedom to make the app function and look exactly how you want it to. Get this app.",5
com.textra,Emily Thompson,"I have been using this app for years and have the paid version, I've tried tons of other texting apps and none have come close to how much I love this one! The color coding is a top-tier, can't live without it feature. I'm finally writing a review in hopes that you guys could add the Material You for Google Pixel icon functionality!! Thank you!! Edit 9/24/22: thank you for adding this pixel feature!!! my home screen looks perfect now! will never use another texting app again!!!!",5
com.textra,G K,"Easy to use with lots of cool features and personalization. I had used Textra before with a previous phone and did not download it with my new phone for several months. Decided to give it a try again, and it has only improved! Purchasing the pro version has been a wonderful decision and I'd do it again!",5
com.textra,Barry,Threat Warning.. my software (Eset Mobile) warned that this app was an Android/TrojanDownloader. Agent. AEN and it should be removed. I did so & reinstalled it from the Play Store but was warned again not to install it for the same reason. Totally bummed as I've used it for years without issue and I 100% loved this app. Now what? UPDATE: That worked!! THANK YOU so much for resolving that issue. I'm ecstatic!,5
com.textra,Maureen B,"I keep coming back to Textra! Since I got my new Samsung Galaxy S20FE, Textra has been showing some recently received & opened texts as unread. That's the only reason I only gave it 4 stars. So I tried a couple other texting apps. None of them looked as good as Textra and they didn't seem to be as customizable. I especially love that I can enlarge the text! Hopefully the unread texts bug will get worked out. Willing to put up with the annoyance because I love everything else about the app!",4
com.textra,chevymontecarlo2003,"My original messages started having intermittent problems after an update. Installing this fixed that. Textra working GOOD! Only thing missing, old notification used to announce when I had a new text. No option 2 config that now but not a big deal. * Is there a way to configure a temporary DRIVING MODE for a user specified number of minutes with a user configured automated response ? If not may that possibly be in a future release?",5
com.textra,Jay Lebeda,"i rarely do this but ive got to say this textra has impressed me. EVERY app advertises ""personalization"" or ""customizable"", ya with all the option potential of a zipper. maybe its the phones and computers i used at the time (or the available at your own risk programming i used) but I feel like i had way more control over how my device functioned 15 years ago. textra gave me a taste of that feeling back. keep doing what your doing",5
com.textra,Camden Courcier,"My main reason to switch to Textra was to be able to snip out pieces of text from a message. The fact that the Android native app is incapable of that is unbelievable to me. So far I have found nothing that the Google made Android, texting native app could do that. texture can't do better. But I will qualify that by saying I have only been using it for about 2 months. So more will be revealed.",5
com.textra,Pat Orlowski,"It's been my favorite texting app for the longest time, but ever since I switched to the Zenfone 9 things got wonky... Though not receiving some text messages could very well be a phone-side problem, Textra has not sent my scheduled messages out on time ever. It only sends them when I wake the phone up. The app has full permissions, too... Not sure what to do.",2
com.textra,Jessa Turner,"I've tried many texting apps & this is by far my favorite. The others were either too cutesy, glitchy somehow or incompatible with my Samsung Galaxy (?) 🙄 This one is just simple enough to be easy to use but has all the extras you could wish for. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",5
com.textra,C Washington,"I got this to color code group messages (after too many near misses - one work related) and I would love it, except... THE NOTIFICATION BUBBLES DON'T GO AWAY AFTER YOU READ THE MESSAGES. This is driving me absolutely insane. So I turned off notifications and now I'm missing messages. Looking for a replacement now. If they'd fix this, it would be AWESOME. But until they do, I have to switch.",2
com.textra,Soar -,"🔖My rating is for my experience, not that of others. Allow backup to a file for 5 stars. STILL no way to backup all settings to a file. Have to change my 👍🏽 to👎🏽. Textra only backs up to Google. I don't want that. No option to disable it or back up to a JSON/CSV file. Old review: 3 big features that I find it lacking are the ability to pinch & zoom to change text size when viewing messages, the ability to mark a message as unread, & the ability to search for emoji by keyword.",1
com.textra,Marc Smith Jr,"This is by far my favorite and preferred texting app. I've been using it for years and always replace the stock Android messaging app on every phone I've owned with Textra. Beginning yesterday, my MMS messages will ONLY send if I restart my phone. It's a terribly annoying bug. I DO NOT have a Samsung device, so please don't suggest that network reset option. I own a OnePlus 10 pro. I've tried resetting my APN as well. Phone restart has been the ONLY solution I've found. Please fix this issue.",3

com.textra,Rj Landis,"I used to love this texting app. First app I've paid for. But it just is super unreliable these days. Over the past 1.5 months, I have so many messages that just fail to send. Especially MMS. I reboot, uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared all connection settings per support recommendation, and it may or may not work for a couple days or weeks and then back to constant failures. I've switched back to the stock Messages app for my Galaxy but wish the app I paid for worked like it used to.",3
com.textra,cathy blum,I love using Textra. I prefer it over the plain message app because of the emojis and its ability to allow me to add words & accents to the memory that are not in the dictionary! I do have one very annoying issue. All apps show up when I want to share a photo but exclude Textra 70% of the time..not allowing me to share! I wish I could find a solution.,5
com.textra,Jessica Minden (gamergirl),This has been my go-to texting app for years. Recently the heads up notification on my android went missing. I didn't realize how much I liked seeing the text message at the top of my screen over what I was doing until it was gone. The chat bubbles are NOT an alternative. They get stuck on my screen and won't go away. Horrible things.... Update: hallelujah the chat bubbles can be turned off. I still miss the text message overlay for 5 to 10 seconds. Now I see 3 words for 2 seconds.,4
com.textra,Lori Barnes,"I love Textra, I been using it for years. I'm glad they are advancing to different/new features on app. I wish they would add a feature that you can hit like & add a quick text response option in return to a text received. And option to see if text was opened or not available. Would be great to show when a person was responding to a text. Textra has really grown. I love it & I hope they continue to make more neat features you can use.",4
com.textra,Hann Henson,I've used Textra for years. Solid app that never seems to have any stability issues or otherwise. What I love about it is its robust customization features that allow you to color code your chats and assign custom chat sounds. Features I would love to see would be a more in-depth message backup feature and maybe some sort of pc integration.,5
com.textra,Gerald Markowitz,"I have been using the pay version of Textra for quite some time. Some features that are helpful: 1. You can’t send a text to a contact without the contact’s phone number being identified as a MOBILE number. So, you can’t accidentally send a text message to a land line. 2. Their support is excellent. Every question or issue I have had with my phone is answered almost immediately. 3. There are several customizations in the settings that let you have the display of messages the way you want it",5
com.textra,Kay Norman,"I continue to be impressed with the customer service. If I have a problem or question and reach out, I have an immediate answer! I have enjoyed using Textra for the past few years. I recently had an issue where I was not receiving the sounds notification for incoming texts. I contacted the developers re the problem. They got immediately back to me and the issue was immediately corrected. Great job!",5
com.textra,Tyler Clarkson,"EDIT: Thanks for pointing out the fact that I can move ads. That helps alot. Me. It works ok. I hate the attachment of media process. Also, the ads at the top appear on a delay, so when you open the app, your most recent message is at the top, and right as you go to tap it, the ad replaces it and you end up clicking the ad instead. Looking for something better and will eagerly jump ship when I find it.",3
com.textra,Brandi Darlas,"The margins in the text message window are glitchy. The margins seem to be eating my words. The words are still there but can't be seen or are only partially visible. When this happens at a point where there is an emoji present it looks like it is cut in half. I like textra it is one of my go to apps, but I also like proofreading my texts before sending them. Sent email to tech support. Not sure if it was received. Using a different app for now. Please fix... thank you.",3
com.textra,Ann D.,"I love this app! It's so customizable, and they're always adding cool new features. They recently added the ability to react to messages, and to see react icons. It makes messaging more fun, and easier with my iPhone friends! I also recently had to contact them with an issue. They responded SO quickly, and solved my problem. I was shocked to hear back at all, much less within an hour!",5
com.textra,jamr514,I highly recommend this app. I can customize ringtones for each person and color code conversations (I have chosen to set a theme of Hogwarts House colors for everyone's texts). The only thing I would really change is I wish there were more colors for the font for texts (only four). It's far superior to the app that came with my phone. I like that I can customize where the ads are in the free version. It's easy to sort out previously sent pictures from text too.,5
com.textra,M. Freeman,"About the only thing that's really bothering me is that the send key is in a terrible spot and in the first 6 hours of having the app I accidentally sent 8 messages before I was done typing by accidentally hitting that damn key. I seem to be the only one having this issue though. Lol It's very annoying. Seems to be a great app otherwise but I've only used it for a few days. There's no ads that I've seen, it's customizable, it has most of the options I want but that damn send key is annoying.",4
com.textra,Barbara Sinnott,"I started using Textra when my phone's internal messaging app became dysfunctional after a system upgrade. When the phone system was fixed, I just couldn't go back to it. Textra has so many extra features and all in living color for coding! That was 2 years ago, and Textra has never had a problem. Just keeps getting better as they add capabilities with updates.",5
com.textra,Chris Phoenix,"Back using this again, and it has been stable. Noticed that it isn't clearing the new message indicator in app unless I open the message a second time. Tried reinstalling, hope it helps. Edit: Reinstall did not help, so it has to do with the script. Currently you have to press your back button (Android) after viewing the message for the new message indicator to go away. It will not clear if you read the message and immediately quit.",4
com.textra,Steve Blitz,"Using Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra for a few months with Textra. Lately I'm having issues when sending out a photo or two. It shows that it's sending, however, it takes anywhere from a minute upto 5 or more minutes for the file to go out. The size of the photos are small at 1/2mb or so. This issue began to occur over the past couple of weeks. I did reset the cache, however it didn't fix the issue. Please advise.",3
com.textra,Ty J.,I've been using Textra for over 5 years and I love this app. The customization options make it my go to for a new phone. The new feature for emoji reactions to texts is a nice touch. Hopefully we can get that for images as well. The ONE thing I have a gripe with is the screen flashing white when I back out of a conversation to the main screen. I don't remember it doing this before but I could be wrong. Still giving the app 5 stars though. But that white flash is definitely slightly annoying.,5
com.textra,Caroline,"I have been a textra user for well over 8 years. I have found it to be exceptional in security, preferences, updates, performance and feedback. Also every update is followed by a textra text bot with an explanation of the update in its entirety along with past update information. Give them a try... You will not ""turn back""! ""Share as email"" works like a dream. ;)Just when l think it can't get any better they now have added ""undo delete."" Wow!👍",5
com.textra,Ulrick Andre,"I've been using textra since 2017. Since then I've had five different phones and each one I installed textra. I love the many customizable options textra offer. I can customize each text for each individual contact. I just love that. I'll highly recommend. Textra has been and will continue to be my go to app for texting. My only issue with textra is that sometimes when sending mms messages, it tends to lag and also fails to send the mms message. That's my only issue with the app.",5
com.textra,Mya Mueller,"I really like this app! It is highly customizable, allowing you to change contact notifications, colorcode conversations, and even choose the location for ads if you choose to stick with the free version as I have. Updates and new features are released often with the recent ability to react to messages, and see reaction icons. This new feature has made texting with my iphone-using friends much more fun! The app is extremely user friendly and the customer service for the help desk is wonderful!",5
com.textra,Adam Stephens,Love this app. Being able to customize the colors and the chat bubbles is exactly what I've been looking for. My suggestions would be to be able to set different color settings for light mode and then a different set of color settings for dark mode though. Maybe some pre-done color templates would be cool too. Keep up the great work!,4
com.textra,Elizabeth Gray,I've lived this app for years but lately I can't send images. They bounce back with a green exclamation point. Occasionally they are going v through and the person will receive it several times even though I'm still getting error message. It's just been the past few weeks. Not sure what's up. Really frustrating though.,3
com.textra,Ben B,"I love this app but I'm having trouble with a feature. When sharing a link from another app to Textra my recent conversations aren't shown as available, instead a blank box with the search icon at the top. This is suprisingly inconvenient. It didn't used to be this way. I can't seem to find a remedy in settings. ???",3
com.textra,Chelsea Williams,"This is the absolute best texting/messaging app I've ever used!! Before Textra I often got an error or text not sent message when trying to send multiple pics. What prompted me to write this review is that I, just now, successfully sent 14 pictures to a friend IN ONE SINGLE MESSAGE!!! Outstanding!! All of the customizing features are a ton of fun! There are ZERO AD INTERRUPTIONS!! This app has NEVER FAILED me!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TEXTRA TO ALL!!! It's absolutely wonderful!!! Thank you TEXTRA!",5
com.textra,Zocial E,I've been using Textra for many many years and I am not switching anytime soon. I can say that it has been one of the best investment I have ever done on an any app. Lot's of cool features but it takes time to learn. Learn the basics first for a good flow then explore deeper for a better experience. Have fun with it party people!,5
com.textra,Rhona,default texting app was faulty and was difficult to turn off read-receipts. No problems with that here. The one downside is that the app is only ad-free on a trial basis and is not clear about it until they ask you to upgrade. Luckily the upgrade is very inexpensive for a good app.,4
com.textra,Geoff Zalot,"I've been using Textra for years and have been happy with it. I would love to see a settings back/restore feature. It would also be nice if you could select the Account Textra uses to name Contacts as they appear within Textra. Individual conversation settings used to be more customizable, e.g., font colors, colors for each side of the conversation (i.e. a different color for yourself in certain contacts than the standard one you use for yourself, etc.). I'd like to see those options return.",4
com.textra,Tron Starking,"I really enjoy this app a lot. I even paid for it. I would just like a bit more costumization. For example: 1. Adding a different background to every chat, as apposed to only black. 2. Being able to costumize the reaction bar that was just added. 3. Adding an incoming text sound while you leave your phone on in the chat, as apposed to needing to hear the notification again. I really hope my suggestions will be considered. Mood is another messaging app that offers A LOT of costumization. Thanks!",5
com.textra,Andrew Alquisira Sr.,Add/remove people from chat feature is needed. Not a fan of the limitations this app has from Google but it's still one of the best customizable text apps. But the ability to add and remove recipients from chat groups has been a long requested feature. It's standard on stock Android. Any hope this feature will ever show up? Edit: how in the hell do we use the undo delete option? The demo isn't clear I I've tried tapping the green box but nothing. Now the box is gone.,3
com.textra,Gia DiCamillo,"After the latest update (Aug 2022), it takes over 3-5s after me hitting the send button for the text to leave the typing area and go to the conversation area to be sent. Very annoying because I'm stuck waiting until I can go anywhere else or type another message. Hope this gets fixed because I've used this app for years but I'll have no choice to change apps if it doesn't get fixed.",2
com.textra,Caryn Newell,MMS timeout! 🙄 Been getting this error all day so far. I just put the app on my phone yesterday. I had it on my previous phone but ended up switching to VZW messages. Switched carriers and used Google messages but thought I would give Textra another try. Looks like I'll have to go back to Google messages. I really like the ability to customize Textra. I was really hoping it would work better.,3
com.textra,T N,Love the app. Unfortunately I have issues when attempting to send pictures. It will just keep trying to send and come back as failed. Samsung Galaxy S21. Update seems to have fixed my issue. Developers very responsive. I do have the paid version and it's worth every penny. I love that we can now reaction emojis. Thank you!,5
com.textra,Frans Wartenberg,"I've been using the Pro version for years, and it works great. With the growing levels of spam in SMS/Texting, there are a few features I'd like to see: A) ability to block list AND remove message. Right now it's either/or, and when you move to a new phone all the old blacklisted messages show up again. B) ability to auto-delete or turn off notifications for messages that come from an ""unknown"" source; the sending number is not in my contacts, and/or a central whitelist with banks, usps etc",5
com.textra,Big Guy Mal,"I've been using this app for many years now. It's a great texting app, and I love being able to customize the appearance as much as I can. I don't think I have anything negative to say about the app, overall! I do wish I could add a background image to my text conversations — but that is far from a necessary feature, so whatever. I still highly suggest Textra to anyone. I definitely suggest paying for it, because it is worth it, but the free version is fine, if you don't want to or can't pay.",5
com.textra,Andrew Kordula,"I've used textra for a few years now and love it. I felt compelled to write a review now because of the incredible support I received. After the latest Android update, my phone randomly will stop receiving text messages. Now, even though my issue wasn't resolved because we found it's not an app issue, the prompt support I received from Textra's support team (Max) was top notch. That kind of treatment is why I would highly recommend Textra!",5
com.textra,AKBees,"i've been using this app for many years now but one thing that continues to bug me is the buggy MMS. every time someone tries to send me an MMS it times out w/o fail (""can't receive MMS; timeout, click to try again""). i have to click the notification several times in order to get attachments, super annoying. with all the fixes they do you think they would fix that.",4
com.textra,Classic Corey,An app that finally does what I need. Google Messenger doesn't notify me when a text fails. Chomp only shows one line of text from the messages in push notifications. This fixes all those problems and much more. I also sincerely appreciate the extensive customization options as well as the wonderful customer support.,5
com.textra,a “acd” d,"Long time user with zero complaints. Reliable and always improving, Textra delivers 100%, 100% of the time. Flexibility keeps it fun and functional. I appreciate the ability to delay text delivery giving u time to revise or change a text. Pinning important texts to the top is a +. UI customization is both fun and functional. The ability to perform well regardless of phone, processor or storage means no worries when upgrading my phone. Fast! Awesome tech support if ever needed. Luv it!",5
com.textra,Esther,"The BEST texting app out there! 5/5 recommend. Download for a trial period then pay $5 for the pro ad-free version, it's worth it. Every feature you can think of is customizable (fonts, colors, text bubble shape, notification icons, emoji style, etc). The developers are constantly upgrading the features based on user feedback, so you can post suggestions/contact the developers if there's anything the app is missing",5

Update: Textra contacted me, I changed some settings and now it's working great!",5
com.textra,Sammy Conway,"its actually real good. There's ads but they aren't invasive and you can even choose where you want them to be on the screen.

For being reliable with no popup ads, I give 5 stars. 👍",5

I had one textra message to one person only come back with the ""!"" error message. I also got a notification that  the message  didn't go through. However, it did go through.  I've been a fan since I started using this app several months ago, but I can't use an app that doesn't work the way it always has.  I love Textra, is there a way to address this please?",2
com.textra,Jackie “Amber” Morris,"It's a great app. You can customize the colors for the sender and receiver. I just wish I could change the background to pictures instead of just the white, gray, or black. Would be cool to be able to change the background for each person.

com.textra,Bn3RD,Well I love it but my Samsung A13 won't play any sound notifications I don't thinks it's the app more or less but when I first installed it the sound notifications worked then they just stopped. I tried all the suggested fixes for the phone but nothing works for this app to make the notification sound work. Which means I will have to go back to the default app for messages.,4

com.textra,Becky Dafoe,"One more needed feature-Would be awesome to know if a message had been delivered and when it's been read. Other text apps display a check mark system for texts sent and also when read. Like WhatsApp... 1 check for successfully sent, 2 checks for successfully delivered and checks turn blue once recipient has read the text. Definitely the best texting app out there today. And they're absolutely IS an automatic backup for all of your settings as long as you have your Google backup turned on!",5
com.textra,David Brager,"I got a new Samsung s22 from a Verizon upgrade as my Mom wanted 24/7 access to my wife and I and trust in our phones working (we were on Pay per month TracFones and local continuity sucked). I went to Textra to replace the default app in the phone from Samsung, which is inferior to the quality of app Textra delivers. Ads are not intrusive for a free app. Very nice. So, today, I paid for the full no ads version. Thank you for a great upgrade to my life.",5
com.textra,Ben Mendez,"Best text app in the market; bar none. Inclusion of replying to messages with emojis almost completes the experience and puts it almost on par with iMessage. Some limitations exist but that's most likely attributed to Android so I can't fault the app. Would love replying with emojis on pictures/videos, maybe a way to send iMessages (or another option) and bypass SMS for quality video sending. But it's fantastic.",5
com.textra,Aidan Stevenson,"I used to love Textra - I've been a Pro user for three years, but I cannot justify using it any longer. Recently, the vibration settings for the notifications are completely gone and ALL notifications no longer follow what you have set in the Android System Settings. I have the ""Heartbeat"" pattern selected (two short pulses), but the Textra app notifications just vibrate as a one-second-long buzz that is incredibly annoying. Until this is fixed, I will unfortunately no longer be using Textra.",2

Tyou can customize it so much it reminds me of the old default andriod texting app. Exactly what I was looking for!

If anything it's nice becuase I can actually reach the top text thread without using two hands. Can't recommend this enough!",5
com.textra,jason root,"It's a good app but frustrating as hell to use if you try to respond to a pop up text notification. One response...and poof, no more dialog box.

I was SO impressed with the quick help!",5
com.textra,twixx C,Legit a great app. If you have issues or questions you get very fast replies and help. I've considered leaving and going stock and I always come back to textra. With pro version you have so many customizations but also everything works exactly as text apps should. You can genuinely make this app do whatever you need. Only thing I would like to see is new developments or customizations but there is definitely something to be said for consistency.,5
com.textra,Kathy S,"8/15/22: It keeps getting better. It has undo a delete and delay sending to give time to correct. 7/5/22: This is a great app. When Google ruined Messages, I looked fervently for a solid text messenger. This is it! What sold me was being able to pin most contacted people to the top. I miss the Google Messages archive folder, but pinning to top is the next best thing. I'm happy and purchased the ad-free Pro version as a thank you. I only wish I could tap a link and go directly to the site.",5

The default vibration type (long) definitely saps more power than I'm used to seeing. Options would be nice. All other texting apps have them.",4

That and the need for apps gives that a 3 stars, but I have been enjoying using textra overall so I won't penalize the rating for using a free app",5
com.textra,Sandysan46,Love Textra so much. So easy to set up and favorite feature is to be able to give a special color to identify certain contacts. I'm so glad to have found Textra and will use it always as my means of text contact. This will be the only texting app that has the Best of Everything. Leaves Google Messages miles behind.,5
com.textra,Marley Hawn,"Love this app and how you can customize all the colors, would give 5 stars if when opening a message it would open the thread to the last read message instead of having to scroll through and find where you left off when getting a bunch of text messages.",4
com.textra,brian,"It works, but you can no longer customize the vibrate function, it's just one way too long buzz for everyone. It feels the same exact way as if you were getting a phone call for a split second. Very annoying and deceiving",3
com.textra,Pamela Martin,"BYE-BYE...I always used to love this app, but lately it has been a nightmare! My texts just hang there and send whenever they damn well please. When people send me texts they can arrive an hour after they've been sent. Group texts are a joke now... I've already emailed customer service and they were unable to help. REVISION:GREATLY IMPROVED!",4
com.textra,Kris Ludeman,I have been using your app for over 5 years and have always loved it but since the last update if I try to send a picture and type a message it erases the picture and leaves a exclamation point. I have to send the picture separately and quickly before it erases it. Please fix this cuz I love your app. Kris,5
com.textra,John Cheater,"Excellent app with everything I need for messaging, however only 4 stars as I would like to have longer repeat notification times. Every 2 minutes is annoying when I can't get to the phone. Would like 10 minutes or a choice. Otherwise brilliant.",4
com.textra,Nic Christeller,"Great app, been using it for years. Feature request: ignore (mark read automatically?) messages that match certain text. Use case: my carrier regularly sends me messages I don't care about. I don't want to block them completely because very occasionally they send me a crucial message.",5
com.textra,Jesse Hoffman,"I've been using this app for over 5 years. I think I like it but I'm never sure if my messages get sent or are received. I have found in the past that some people never received an important message I sent. It seems like it won't let me share links to Verizon customers. Also when sending photos or video to an iphone, the iphone user receives a pixelated photo or video.",5
com.textra,Sage Clack,The app is fine. Color choices are nice. The only drawback is it shows an unread message when there are no unread messages. It's the reason for the four stars are not the five. Could also be nice to have the emoji comments as they do in the native app.,4
com.textra,J.D. Simmons,After trying several other SMS apps to replace the stock (non)app on my Samsung phone I decided on this one immediately upgrading to the Pro version after the trial. So far it's been easy to use and no problems. I like the options for customization.,5

com.textra,G Batt,Great app! Excellent functionality and customization. I recently upgraded to 4.56 and for some reason I'm not getting notification sound when a text comes in. Can you help? I want to upgrade to 4.57 however this option is not available in Google Play store.,4
com.textra,PinkHibiscusx,"EDIT: Thank you to the developer for helping me find the feature I needed. Keep up the great work.

com.textra,Brian K,"Really fantastic texting app! The delayed send feature is a an absolute godsend and it alone is worth the price of admission. Add matching iPhone emojis, and other features, and you have a excellent alternative to the default texting app.",5
com.textra,Saucy Sammy,"Usually a Super~Fan, but of late, this App disappoints. While trying to send pictures, some emojis, anything MMS .. Message says, ""Can't get MMS timeout."" OTHER USERS are having the SAME PROBLEM. Never had this worry before. Please fix. I don't WANT to have to delete Textra. Thanking~You❣️",2
com.textra,Steven Otero,Only rate it 3 stars because it doesn't have auto reply when driving. Adding auto reply would make this a 5 star and the best texting app out there. This should be something added to make it safe when driving so as to not be distracted. Please add auto reply like the Verizon message+ texting app has built-in.,3
com.textra,Ruth Campbell,"This is my primary texting app. I really like the scheduling capability and the customer service is prompt and very helpful. My issue affected the app but was not a problem with the app. I have the paid for ""no ad"" version on my s21 Ultra.",5
com.textra,Lluvias Rain,"Wonderful app. I originally wrote a review from my older Google account, but idk where it's at, lol. I'll just review from this one again. They deserve all the good reviews, anyways! I've been using Textra for so many years.. even when its features were much more simple. Always was the most reliable texting app I could find across a series of different devices, too. Many years and phones later, each update just keeps getting better. Thank you to the team behind it!!",5
com.textra,M L Patterson Fisher,"Texting done right. I've recommended Texttra to several people. The customization is great, and honestly, well worth the upgrade to Pro, which I did after the first few days of use. Great app!",5
com.textra,Clint “Phantom Echoes”,Previous review heaped high praise of this app with the exception that you couldn't like text. Now you can. Best text app. Runs circles around it's competitors. Also props to the developers for sending knowledge base articles to school people on how to spot fraudulent and malicious text!👌🏿👏🏿,5
com.textra,Therese Jovich,"This app has a lot of customizations like fonts, icons respond to a message with a emoticon. I really like that option. Googleessages does that but your limited. you can also share large videos with this app so much easier than my stock message app.",5
com.textra,Lisa Sebesta,I've used textra for years and love it!. Twice needed support (wasn't a textra issue but a android/samsung issue both times).

com.textra,Uche Okoronkwo,"Good Job by Developer. Fast in Sending and Receiving Messages. One thing is lacking in the App. There should be a provision for Archived messages, as in Pulse and Google Messages. Please do something about this. Some messages aren't supposed to be left open. Thank You",5

Within minutes I had the answer on how to fix. I wish I would have asked a year ago! Textra Support for the win!",5
com.textra,Matthew D,"Really good app. Continuous improvements. The ability to archive messages (as opposed to deleting them) would make this an easy 5 out of 5, however I will withold a fifth star until that feature is implemented Did I mention message archiving and thread locking?

com.textra,Aaron Schoeffler,"Could you add automatic detection of MMS as best you can? Isn't there a list maintained somewhere? If not, do your own research and as the ten biggest carriers in the world, as well as the ten biggest in the USA. This is two people's 1 day of work and could be backwards compatible with the current version. That or have you considered adding in plugin support? Your Textra as Default User count would skyrocket because there are so many people who need automated proc but can't find a top tier app.",5
com.textra,Tammy McLendon,I love this app despite the fact I have to eventually delete and reinstall. It grows like a monster and eats up my space! Is there anything to help this? Editing....used this app since 2019. Still love the app. My issue at this point is I can't directly open links in messages. I have to tap the pop-up to open links. Other than that it's great,4
com.textra,Laura Koch,"I've been using Textea for many years now and love it!! I have an Android and Textra allows me to have group texts with my iPhone friends and family.

You have the ability to stall sending mssgs ability to recall sent texts up to eight or nine seconds afterhitting send. It is a lifesaver! Otherwise some very personal pictures of mine would have gone right out to my boss. Thank you Textra!,5
com.textra,Miles M,"Used for years but searching for alternative. Creepy ad tracking, can only opt out in CA and EU. TEXT MESSAGES should be more private than anything.

com.textra,Dan Dickey,Been using the pro version for years and it's very capable. But if you occasionally try to send a video you'll likely hit a snag. On Verizon the mms limit is 1MB and the app will not compress videos that are too large as native apps iMessage or Samsung Message does. You'll just get a send failure with no explanation.,4
com.textra,Evan Lambert,"Overall good but major design flaw When a text doesn't go through you get no notification that it's failed. I've had this happen and multiple occasions. I texted my wife this morning and they never went through and there is not a single indication that it failed to send other than it doesn't have ""sent"" below the message. If something doesn't send you guys should make it more obvious so people aren't waiting for responses to messages that never went out.",3
com.textra,Kathy Lamm,After continuously having issues with AT&T and Galaxy S22 ultra not sending/receiving messages with stock message apps I read about Textra on Reddit. Downloaded immediately and have not had an issue since. After the trial period I was more than happy to pay the small fee for the ad free version. Works perfectly and runs smoothly.,5
com.textra,Steve Bishop,"Update: Better now. Thanks for fixes.make it so when an iPhone user hits like, it turns the reply into a like on an Android phone of the text that is quoted? Would be nice to have a feature like this. The app could parse the text of the message on Android and look for the word Liked with quotes and then change how the previous message displays with a like icon. Is this going to work now that Google is adding it to their messages app? Also, I can no longer click on web links in my texts anymore.",4
com.textra,Ricardo Barbosa,"It's weird, its the best sms app I've ever tried, then it just stops functioning.

com.textra,K Mohrmann,I've been using this app for a long time without fail. Just recently I have not been able to open up a link directly from the app. I would have to copy the link in the text message and paste it to a web browser. I have no idea how this started happening but is there any fix,4
com.textra,Pacey,"Textra is a great and very customizable messaging app. It was absolutely my go-to for the longest time. The only thing it doesn't have is RCS, then it would be perfect. The moment the app gets this is the moment Textra becomest permanent testing app, as it blows messages and other apps out of the water imo otherwise.",4
com.textra,Art Castner,Love this app...was using pulse sms for 3 years but the recent update caused some issues and they didn't have as much customization as textra.

com.textra,Kerri Cohen,"This is THE ABSOLUTE BEST messaging app EVER! It has so many features that I can't live without now. My favorite being the scheduling feature. I can type a text and schedule it to send on any date at any time I want in the future.

It is so convenient, I never have to worry about forgetting to text someone happy birthday ever again!",5

It would be nice to have an option to turn on notification sounds every time you get a message, regardless.",5
com.textra,Phil Drader,Was super easy to setup. Would give it 5 stars if it had an adjustable reminder interval with a different sound selectable from the original text. My old reminder app had those functions. Also missing some basic functions like being able to select and automatically shrink videos to send.

com.textra,Susan Hastings,"I love this app. My only complaint is when an iPhone user ""likes"" my text, it tells me with a copy of my text back to me.

Hope you add a feature like that in the next update,5

com.textra,Amy Harry,"I really like this app. You can customize the colors on everything and the look and feel which is nice. The one downside is that you can't pinch to increase or decrease the font size. The default Samsung Galaxy app allows you to do that and it's a huge benefit. I would like to see that feature added to this app. Without it, you have to change the font size in the settings which isn't very convenient.",4
com.textra,J R,"Been using it for years now. The only issue I have is that it's annoying to get a new text when someone ""likes"" a message in a group chat. It's unnecessary to get a message saying ""Liked "" whatever the text said"""". Just leave it as a simple thumbs up on that particular message.",4
com.textra,Darryl Doak,Excellent SMS replacement app! Honestly this is one of the best SMS apps I've tried. The fact that Apple won't open up iMessage compatibility cross platform means apps like this have a market. The ability to React to texts with emojis is a great feature as well as changing the emoji theme to match iOS means I can actually see what friends intend to send me. Great job Textra!,5

Now I'm not even getting all my texts! I've been through options up & down nothing makes a difference.... Getting very upsetting & frustrating.,2
com.textra,Robert Lernet,Very good texting app with lot of customization options. My one gripe is that the app time stamp frequency is too slow. Texts are only time-stamped every 15 minutes or so. Time-stamps are important for coversation context as people stop/start within the text thread. Google Messenger time-stamps every text.,4
com.textra,Nicole J,"Still my favorite app of all time. Nothing beats the customization of this app. One of the best out there. I've had this app for years and any problems I've had, I've been able to get taken care of through their support team. If you have issues, email their support team! They respond super fast and are very helpful!",5
com.textra,Liam mc manus,Up until recently I would have given this app a 5 star rating. I paid for premium because I liked it so much but recently it won't mark messages as read when I've seen them. My reason for getting the app was for sending scheduled text messages (which still works as far as I'm aware) . I will be returning to the standard messaging app until this is fixed.,1
com.textra,Suavo Sanchez,"So far, this is an amazing app. I recently had to stop using Signal as my primary SMS service due to discontinued support and was worried I wouldn't be able to find another app that was as customizable and reliable to use. But Textra has it all! It even has support for iMessage BS which (as an android user) has been a perennial annoyance since the early days of emoji support. I was prepared to settle for a mediocre app, marginally better than factory, but thankfully I was blown away instead!",5
com.textra,Josh Dejewski,"Best texting app I have used. (I've tried many). Lots of options on customizing whether thats your chat bubbles or which emojies you use-(apple, android, google). I chose to purchase the upgraded version so I had no ads. You can use it completely fine without purchasing that but I have no regrets with my purchase.",5
com.textra,Jennifer Dillon,"it's smooth. I'm not a power user, just a regular texture, and I've had no issues. easy to send pics and share screen shots. easy to reply and quick reply. I need to get my husband to switch but he's stubborn.",5
com.textra,K Wood,"I have very happily used Textra for years and love the many great features it includes. But recently I have been having issues with some outgoing texts failing, though by no means all. Seems totally random. I can send texts to one contact without an issue, but when I tell sending another, it fails. And sometimes the text sends, even though it still indicates it has failed. So annoying! I have tried sending the same texts through the standard Android messages app without any issue.",5
com.textra,Renee Schut,"A nice detail to choose different colors for your contacts, BUT I can't make calls from the app though my contact list is accurate. Sent texts are not always received, AND I don't always receive texts! Nice trial of 2 months, but I'm looking elsewhere.",3
com.textra,Richard Powers,"I have only used Samsung and Verizon messaging apps. Textra is amazing. Great customization. Android users can use this app to see iPhone emojis on text and you can do the same. I'm not sure of any android apps with this function. The defaults don't do it. So you won't receive the 'tom liked message ""sounds good""' anymore. Other than that no problems. There's other features that Textra had before the default apps Just buy it and make others u know buy it. 😆 I love it",5
com.textra,L B,"Nothing but SIMPLY THE BEST. Google message app does not even come close. Love that SMS auto switches to MMS once SMS reaches its limit with no action required by me. The number of options it offers is mind boggling. You have the option to go PRO to remove adds for the tiniest $amount ever. INSTALL it, you will not be disappointed. I am giving it 10 stars because it is worth it. ********** 💙💚❤️",5
com.textra,Neil W,"I've been using Textra for years and have been very happy. The features to delay sending a text by a few seconds, or to schedule a text to send at a future day/time are the best options in a texting app that I have ever seen.",5
com.textra,Owen Smith,"I really like this app as it's a bit less glitchy than the original Samsung messaging app but it still has some issues like sending messages out of order or messages taking forever to send or just not sending at all sometimes. One of the biggest recent bugs for me is that I'm using an android, and when I use emoji reactions with someone who has an iPhone, they just receive a message saying I ""loved"" their message instead of an actual emoji reaction as they would with another iPhone.",4
com.textra,Mike Ritchey,"Great messaging app! It's customizable with plenty of options and has a nice clean look, including a dark theme. And finally, like iphone messaging, a quick way to ""love"" or ""like"" someone's comment to you without having to make a responce text. Try it… you'll like it!",5
com.textra,Andy Richardson,"Great customer support! Great work on snap back consistency. Wish it worked on pictures/media, but understand. I regularly try other sms apps to make sure what is out there but always come back to Textra. They have been leaders in innovation for years.",5
com.textra,Jerry,"I am ready to pay the few dollars to remove ads. I am a little unhappy that there is no instant add for audio files. I have to find them in my folders, copy and paste, a shortcut would make this app perfect!",4
com.textra,Keri Breese,"Loved this app until I woke up and was notified there is a Trojan software attached to it! Uninstalled the app and reinstalled. Got the same warning about a Trojan from my anti-virus, so it's embedded in the software. After just buying the pro version too. What a waste of money since ill be promptly deleting. Beware!!!",1
com.textra,Lisa Gomez,"This doesn't have achieve folder so I can save verification codes and others from apps that send me important information and codes and things, please fix this problem and respond to this message on your review ASAP! I'm not using the delay anymore because it really doesn't work so that's fine, but I really love this app! It says you responded but I don't see anything on your app review at all!",4
com.textra,ayuxx,I've suddenly started getting a lot of random underlined words and phrases with suggestions to open them in the Google Maps app. The default Messages app doesn't seem to have this problem. Not sure what's changed in the past few days.,3
com.textra,Florin,"My second SIM is disabled in the phone's settings, why do I still get am option to choose between SIM1 and SIM2 right next to the text field? It's annoying and unnecessary! Second, I would like to be able to set my own background image for text messages - is that so difficult to implement?",3
com.textra,Mary Carpenter,"This is the best texting app hands down. Lightning fast, features no other app has, and the most customizable experience I've had with a messaging app probably ever. Which is honestly kinda crazy. Only thing this could do better is connect to imessage somehow",5
com.textra,R H,"UPDATE - Thank You Textra for the rapid response and verification of it as a false positive. I'm pleased to know you have opened a ticket with ESET for review and confirmation of the fp. Major respect for taking such immediate action on this report. Truly impressed! ----------- ESET security has flagged this latest update as a Trojan. Specifically, a TrojanDownloaderAgent.AEN variant. This is absolutely unacceptable. Either ESET has this as a false positive, or Textra has a huge security issue.",5
com.textra,Garrett Acree,"Great texting app, have been using it for a few years now. I like how you can customize the colors of your messages. Also the optional send delay is something I've been grateful for many times! *2022 Edit: THANK YOU FOR UNKNOWN CONTACT NOTIFICATION SILENCING!!! Best new feature ever!!! Textra for life",5
com.textra,Jen Blanton,"i love this app 😍 but I wish it had a way to sort messages by ""unread"" and ""containing media"" so I could more effectively manage my inbox. I'd also like to be able to send audio clips/sound bytes and voice recordings. Please consider these in future updates Thanks!",4
com.textra,Geoff Chr,"I've used this app quite happily for two or three years. Today I needed to forward a phishing SMS but couldn't find any way of doing so. So I wrote to the developer who responded immediately. He explained that the feature was there and how to access it, which was embarrassingly simple!",5
com.textra,michael “cosmosm3” l,fantastic app. very customizable for individual contacts. great visuals. three years later.. still love Textra. updated frequently and now has blocking available. it remains very effective and intuitive with excellent graphics.,5
com.textra,Kay Riojas,"Easy to use, great emojis, able to lock important messages, & send multiple texts. Sometimes, multiple attachments are slow or you do have to resend, but so much better then other text app we've tried. Textra is constantly improving the app!",5
com.textra,Charles Marks,"PROBLEM??? New Phone (Google Pixel 7, Android 12) - unable to change the notification sound for the app to anything other than the system default. The others all appear but play no sound if selected. Is this a new issue? I have paid version and have added/removed the app too.",4
com.textra,Janet Miller,I have been using Textra for a couple of years. My favorite feature is to be able to send 'Chat' or 'Bulk' texts. Chat meaning all people on text get the responses. Bulk meaning responses only come to me. Really good and helpful app.,5
com.textra,Jeff Horne,"Unlike other SMS apps I have used, this doesn't allow me to set the swipe direction to delete. It also requires a swipe and two taps. These should be customizable. Other than that, I like it so far.",4
com.textra,Klaudia Michelle,Better than the stock message app! Customer service is quick in responding. Being able to delay a text from sending by a few seconds is a great feature... Every time they have an upgrade date had something new.,3
com.textra,Jennifer Crisman,I love the simplicity and colorfulness of Textra! I've been using the app for years. The only suggestion I have is to make it so you can mark a message unread again after reading if you don't want to forget to check on it again.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I have been a Textra user for as long as Textra has been Textra, I love Textra, I have NEVER experienced any issues with the app it's always been reliable, very customizable, all I can say is if you want the best then look no further Textra is the best Messaging app you can get, Spend the few bucks and go pro you'll be happy you did, I'm a Textra user for life",5
com.textra,L A,It's not working properly won't send videos (always some issue with this) but won't allow the video to be opened. This app has always been bad about sending any video I often have to use a different messaging app,1

com.textra,Mike A,Best texting app I've ever used. Very customizable. The only thing I would like to see is when you do a schedule message is being able to set a repeat message for every day / week or month.,5
com.textra,Daniel D Kitteringham,"TROJAN ALERT I have both ESET Mobile Security and Textra on my phone for a few years. Textra has been on a few years longer with other antivirus apps installed with it. Never did ESET or any other antivirus app flag Textra for anything, until today. ESET flagged Textra with android/trojandownloader.agent.aen. That means Textra has been infected or injected with an auto malware downloader. Users need to install and run an anti virus scan ASAP. This has been reported to Google.",1
com.textra,Dave “Dr Dave” Kirkpatrick,All the slick features mean nothing since this app is one hack away from your phone being pwnd - there's no way to disable / block mms except by first blocking the sender. So this means that any unknown sender just needs to send an image containing malware and your phone is owned.,1
com.textra,Lezli Klitzke,my other message app kept failing. This is much better although it will fail to send a message now and then I at least get a notice and can resend it right there. I would like to be able to customize more than what's there but it's good.,4
com.textra,Shaun Phillips,Have used textra (paid version) for a few years now and it's brilliant. So much so I don't even think about it. I'm a business user with a decade of sms and its still lightning fast. It just works with no messing around!,5
com.textra,Jacob Huempfner (JaykeBird),"A lot of features and customization options, allowing me to have precisely the text messaging experience I want. Really awesome app overall, and I have very few complaints.",5

com.textra,William Bundy,Only using for about 3 hours but it does what I want it to do that Google & Samsung messages does not do and that is when multiple pictures are sent you can delete them separately without deleting others. Would be nice to have a trash like Samsung.,5
com.textra,Melissa Malatesta,*They reached out and had me email and walked me through fixing my problem* I'm really loving this because my last text stopped giving me delivery notifications after their latest update. I like the customization with this app and though it could have more it's still nice. My only complaint and what I REALLY hate is that I can't have my floating bubbles/chats anymore. I loved that because I have a few people that I text all day pretty much and I hate that I can't have their icon anymore.,5
com.textra,Holly Zlotopolski,I prefer using Textra over the messaging app that comes on any of my phones. I have been able to copy and send entire conversations to my email address to save for later use I think that's my favorite attribute that texture offers,5

com.textra,Sean Jackson,So far so good. If they had a private box they would get 5 stars.....update 9/24/22 I'm getting some of my text messages 6-12 hours later. This is no good and needs to be addressed. Dropped my rating from 4 to 2 stars. Please fix. *Update 10/20/22......messages are coming through regularly again.,5
com.textra,S Davi,"I find the app is very good, good enough to be my default mail app, and good enough to have paid for the PRO version. There are improvements needed to be 5 🌟. a) ability to archive b) ability to search either archives or non-archived individually c) ability to search within one conversation (on this I was told by the developer I could limit the search to a specific conversation by putting the contact name [or group] into the search field - and yes it works nicely)",4

com.textra,Jordanray7049,"I have used Textra for going on 6 years now. I wouldn't use any other app. The only reason it gets 4 stars (and in fact the only reason I'm giving a review) is as of late, it won't send pictures. I'm sure this will only be a temporary problem. I suggest this app to anyone!",4
com.textra,Universal Mycelium,Best text messages app I ever used. Has everything I ever wanted in a text message app. Beautiful.

com.textra,Natanya O'Brien,"Best messaging app I've used. The customization is perfect along with how easy it is to send and recieve messages. It does come with a few bugs though. Integration with other messaging apps is almost nonexistent, especially with reaction messages other people use. You will often recieved a message saying ""[Name] liked your message [insert entire message]."" There's also issues with texting large messages. The text box increases, making seeing the active chat a challenge.",4
com.textra,Josef H.,"The app's features are brilliant, the app itself doesn't work properly. Some messages are never received when Textra is set as the default messaging app. It simply isn't reliable. I had to switch back to Google messages. Also, deleting a message takes an unnecessary number of steps! You have to 1. swipe, 2. tap, 3. tap to confirm. That's just ridiculous.",1
com.textra,ariel hantom,"Was indeed a network transition delay. Love the app, its reliable, I'm receiving all. Couple of small things could do with a tweak for efficiency but nothing dramatic, soo small i dont even remember what they are till i try doing them lol.

Still to figure out if i actually need wifi or data to run the app 😂 probs not if it's to replace preinstalled.",5
com.textra,Dave Townsend,"I've been using this app for a while and just love its functionality,and ease of use. I especially like the group text options.

Wish there was an auto reply feature when I'm driving, but no big deal....",5

I've gone to my Pixel 6 settings and selected ""Silent"" for incoming Textra messages, but when my phone isn't on silent, then Textra will still vibrate/ring. I want phone calls to ring at night, but I don't want Textra to ring. If someone could help me figure out how to silence Textra notifications either on the app or on Pixel 6 settings, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!",5
com.textra,Onno van Santen,Very nice app. I would bump it to a 5 star of I did not have the unfortunate occasional creating of a group message they is send from a spontaneous group pulled from unrelated contacts. I emailed you about this issue and I hope you get this bug fixed. No response on my request.....thanks I've bought it as I was happy with it overall - can you STOP your program from sending me requests for reviews?! I shall have to start bumping further stars as my expression of frustration with this practice,3

com.textra,Contaminated312,Textra has been a long time favorite SMS app of my which constantly gets improved. Would like to make a suggestion for developers to include a method to filter out unknown numbers that text you (like a spam or junk folder).,5
com.textra,BR D,Works good and does post dated messages. A few additions that would be good. 1) Adding or removing a person to an existing group. 2) having the option of having a picture for the background.,5
com.textra,Hanno TallBear,i love the ability to change the colors of the interface and the text bubbles. the emojis are great. secure. no issues at all.,5
com.textra,Nikki Iedema,The paid version is a good deal. It is not expensive. I like no ads and the fact I can respond to text messages with a love icon without having to go out and buy an iPhone.,5
com.textra,Somebody's Account,"Great texting app, works great, many customization features, but not overwhelming. Ad-Free is kinda pricey, but I think the devs deserve some money so... Eh Could also use RCS features added to keep the functionality on par with stock messenger apps",4
com.textra,Michael Austin,"This is almost the best text app on the market but unfortunately it is not compatible with the Samsung Watch. Once the developer update the app it will be perfect. Hopefully, it will be updated soon.",1
com.textra,Lain Abbott,It is a pleasure to open and use Texta. It is an elegant simple program that allows one to tailor it according to one's needs and purpose. Never has it glitched.,5
com.textra,Panayoti Kokalis,So far seems good. Moved here because pulse moved downhill unfortunately. Hope they allow for you to message from your computer one day and also for them to know when someone read your message.,4
com.textra,Mark Giardina,The app is really good. Lots of customizing and such. My only issue is that my phone just finished installing the new update for android and suddenly i lost my pro status?,5
com.textra,Matt L,"Been using this app for several years, no way I'd go back to the stock garbage app. This app is so good, it should be the default on all android phones!!!",4
com.textra,A,"It's great for customization but it keeps showing messages as being unread even though I've read them & even tapped on ""mark all as read."" They'll mark as read, but next time I go into the app more msgs will be ""unread."" This has been a problem for years and I'm not sure it will ever be resolved. I tried to help the devs troubleshoot back in like 2019 but I guess it's not a fixable issue on Google Pixel phones. These phones are kinda garbage so I bet it's a Google problem.",4
com.textra,Justin Benn,"Been using this for some years now. Have carried it across numerous Android phones. A mature, well-featured. Eset antivirus is throwing up a false positive for the app (November '22). Hopefully this will be resolved soon.",5
com.textra,Mike T,I've been using textra for years and it's great. Feature rich without being bloated. It's intuitive and user friendly and has everything I want.,5
com.textra,scott tighe,Sadly uncustomizable. Display only 5 messsages because font and spacing is so big and wasteful. Probably good for big tablet where space is available. Not useful for phone.,1
com.textra,Jake,"My favorite texting app for years now, but it does not have split view/dual column support for Z Fold phones. It'd go back to my default if it gains that functionality",4
com.textra,Shauna M,I've been using for years because the native app on Samsung is so ugly. Had a problem and they were very fast to respond with a solution to my emojis not working correctly. Think I'll upgrade.,5
com.textra,Mark Ware,"I have tried a lot of messaging apps and so far, this is the best. Different themes and interfacing with Apple (I have Samsung) is better than anything I have seen. Recommend.",5
com.textra,Aaron Zifovich,Came back after a long while. Everything is improved except notification vibrations are too long. 2 SMS in a row and it feels like someone is calling.,4
com.textra,Thomas M.,I have been using Textra since the very beginning. All of a sudden my pro version is gone. Support has no record of my purchase. Not happy. Google billing only going back to 2019. How do I show proof then.,1

com.textra,Tamra Parker,"I love the ways in which you can customize Textra. The functionality is also really good. It has everything the other apps have, and more.",5
com.textra,Schuyler Ryan,"fixed an issue for me that persisted across multiple phones where group SMS was really buggy if there were any apple users in the group (this is Apple's fault for intentionally not confirming to a standard text communication protocol). regardless of fault, textra makes the group chats work as expected which is really nice",5
com.textra,Avnesh Verma,"I am using this app since last 6 months and really now i am fan of this nice app but there is one important thing is missing. If we could get category feature for texts like personal, promotional, finance...etc than this app will perfect in every aspect. So i just request plz add category features in textra.",4
com.textra,adrinp,Enjoy this message app better than many others I tried so i went to Pro. Would like to see the ability to search for a key word in the history of a conversation.,4
com.textra,Frank Schmitt,I use Android.I had been put on random group texts of people I do not even know. Android has no system by which to easily block these. Textra DOES. And it is easy to use. It is all I use for messaging now.,5

com.textra,Leasa P,"4.5/5 - I love this app, the KEEP update is nice BUT I wish there was a way you could mark a text as unread so if I don't have time to respond when I see it I can mark it and go back later. Add that, you get 5 stars.",4
com.textra,SKOOKUMUNGA,"This app just keeps getting better.....Now a feature called ""Keep"".... No more sending myself texts....How dope is that?! I have a Ham Radio smartphone which is a pain in the A$$ and this is the only app that works well with an Alps RFINDER",5

com.textra,Russell Fryman,"I've been a pro user for many years. I can't recommend this enough. Buy the pro version, you won't be disappointed. Question though: is rcs messaging on the development calendar?",5
com.textra,Swimming Pools,I would like to buy the pro version but nothing happens when I tap on the button to buy it. App works perfect though.,4

com.textra,Dually 3500 (Dually 3500),"So i still like your app until i had to reset my phone,and now im not getting texts or not very many,so i had to stop using it,i did like all the features tho when it worked for me.",3

Seems to be a documented issue with others so it might be a miui issue. Also some people have reported a fix if you set textra to autostart in app settings but for now I've gone back to Google messages as my sms app. Thanks, been in contact with carrier for weeks trying fixes but it's not carrier related. Even tried new sim!",2
com.textra,Kenny Sanders,So far so great ! Replaced Google messages with this after doing my research and have to say I really glad I came over to Textra ! Can't wait for more updates and improvements!!,5
com.textra,Daniel Seibert,I have tried other texting apps and they work okay. Textra was suggested by a T-Mobile Tech and does eveerything I need to block spammers and getting the messages out to those I text. excellent messaging app.,5
com.textra,Jonathan L,"The best Android text app available, hands down. I started using Textra in May of 2017 and they are still adding new features to keep up with user requests.

com.textra,Efuru Patterson,"I LOVE this app! I've been using this app for a few years and it just keeps getting better and better! This app gives you features that the BIG companies are waving at you as some ""perk"" it's likely,Textra has implemented it ready.I recommend them to everyone.",4
com.textra,Misha Ketslah,"Ffs, I have paid version and you dare to put popup ads 🤦‍♂️ Edit: to be clear it was not SMS, as it is not in the list of incoming ones, it was popup that stays open and has ""Save"" button.",1
com.textra,Missy Chandler,Great app! Gets better with every update. Has some great features on it.Easy to use.No snags. Better than app that comes with phone.Love it.Wouldn't use anything else.,5
com.textra,Samii Ann B,"Responce....,..Yes it is the app n not my carrier as my built in sms app and other apps worked immediately.

Its the only app i can find that let me react to msgs and now i cant use it.",1
com.textra,Joshua Cronin,"Alright, look. There's been quite a few incidents where I do not receive texts. This happens a lot when I'm connected to a wifi network. I need this fixed or I'll be forced to leave this app.",1
com.textra,Neko Crafter,"Been using it and a fan for a while, but I have a major issue with group texts. My carries does support them, and the issue solely exists in Textra, after a brief bit my messages will stop sending, and I'll stop receiving any, this happens on data and wifi, and takes 10-20 minutes for the message to display ""Can't get MMS timeout"" and I'll finally get messages again. This happens every 2-5 minutes of texting and is ridiculous. Restarting Phone and clearing cache doesn't help",1
com.textra,Shirley Smajd,"This was recommended to me, and while it does have lots of really nice features, unfortunately there are no auto reply or driving mode functions. I use those functions daily, so the need for them outweighs all the other features of the app, so unfortunately I have to uninstall and revert back to my previous app.",4
com.textra,Carly Weems,"I've used Textra for years, but suddenly this week my pictures are continually failing to send. I get ""Can't get MMS"" messages constantly.

com.textra,Sam P,"Can't send videos, have to use the native app. It was working last week... Don't blame my phone, don't blame my file (it sent fine last week), don't blame me. It's your app. There are no network issues here.",2
com.textra,Wes Patton,Search within conversation would be a good addition. Media sorted by type as well. Seems like progress was made this year though.,3
com.textra,JeoueX Cult,I paid the full version before but got ads again after update. Waste of money. Edit: Ofcourse there is a need to rate you 1 star. You're not doing a great job if people are losing licenses. Think people!,1
com.textra,E. Tan,"Fully customizable down to the keyboard, font size and color scheme. Been using for several years now without issues. Best sms app for me!",5

com.textra,Gerard,"My Google Pixel texting started acting funky, to the point it took minutes to send/receive, heated my phone and drained the battery. Contacting Google was fruitless. So I tried Textra and LOVE it. My phone is again working like new. I suggest Google buys Textra as it's dependable, super fast and easy to use. And their customer service is excellent! 5 STARS!",5
com.textra,Joe Wylliams,have been using the pro version for a long time now and it's the best messenger out here. My only problem is one. Sometimes messages fail to show due to android's ability to block running applications when the screen is turned off. I have disabled batter optimization and other settings to make it run smoothly but android 7 and above seems to override Textra SMS. I hope you can find a way in which it can be a device admin app if other settings fail. It's my all time favourite SMS app.,5
com.textra,Melissa Mack,"I really really love this app, I just wish it had that thing where you can see if someone has read your message when you send someone a text, but other than that, the app is great & it is beautiful!",4
com.textra,Michael Pangburn,Will not let me send photos from my gallery to groups. Update: i was promptly contacted by Textra and was able to resolve the issue! (You must explicitly enable permissions and reboot),5
com.textra,DanielandTerri Spilde,I have been using this app for about 5 years I really like the personalization that can be done I like how it notifies you of text messages coming in I like how it lets you view send pictures everything that you would want to do in a text app. To the builders of this app Would you consider adding an option to post your data to an external SD card instead of the internal phone memory?,5
com.textra,Chris Nelson,"This app is fast, easy to use, and has the features I wanted. It has served me well for the last 7 years as a paid user... Until it didn't. Before today, this was a 5 star app. However, today when opening a conversation, the app crashed and i lost an entire text conversation of 3 years. I hope Textra fixes this issue.",3

com.textra,Matthew Giannone,I have been using textra for many years with the premium version. I can't say enough good things about the app. But its last update is completely crippling my device. Crashes when opening front camera or even the menu that allows it. Please help?,5
com.textra,Stu Bowden,Full featured SMS & MMS client for Android. I love this app. You can set customised tones and colours for each conversation and schedule messages to be sent later. Requested features: -- archive stale conversations older than x months so they can be internally compressed and out of view -- when a message is scheduled can another message be allowed to be sent to the same conversion? Sometimes I'd like to send a quick reply to an incoming message and keep the scheduled message in place. Thanks!,5
com.textra,G,"Absolutely the best customization app for text, unfortunately l had to get rid of it. It was turning on permissions by itself, and in the years I've used it, it never did that.!!",5
com.textra,Ulric Ogle,"Three stars because the call function needs improvement. Calls fail to connect or other party cannot hear me. Messages take up to 8 hrs to be delivered at times.

com.textra,Melissa Troy,"I want to love this app, but my main contact with thousands of messages disappears. Then a day or 2 later reappears with only a few messages. What's missing is quick texts, categories for important messages from spam, and backup & restore. If the these were fixed and/or implemented I would love it and keep it.",2
com.textra,yeh (yeh),"It wouldn't surprise me if I've been using this app for over a decade. It's constantly giving me what I've wanted out of a messeging app. Customization is why I love Android and Textra adds to that. They've added tap back reactions, which I love. Hoping they add the read receipts since that's been added to Samsung messaging app.",5
com.textra,J Shade,How to eliminate KEEP? It should be an option and not a forced destination that replaces one of the lines on quick share/message.,3
com.textra,Paolina Guerrier,"It's a pretty great app so far. I do appreciate how customizable it is and that MMS isn't an annoying hassle for me. The only thing I would love to see is a Category feature, so I can organize my family, friends, colleagues, etc., so it wouldn't be cluttered and hard to find messages.",3

I'm very funny about my text messages and the way they look. Also I have never had any issues with them. Love this messaging app. Hated when Google made them stop using colored notification lights. Absolutely loved that feature. Still hands down the simplest best messaging app.,5
com.textra,Kacey C,"I love this texting app! I am currently using the free version so I see ads but I am considering paying for it, which I never do, just because I think it is such a well-designed app. the ads are placed according to where you want them which I think is a very thoughtful thing to do for non-paying customers. it is that thoughtfulness that makes me want to pay for it. Great job developers!",5
com.textra,J Erickson,"(4yrs later): BEST text app from the many, many I've tried! (test others regularly: textra always wins!) Upgraded to Pro a few yrs ago for 1 time few bucks. Free version definitely full feature.

Developer regularly updates, welcomes suggestions & actually responds to questions/concerns. THANK YOU!",5

Descriptively, for it to receive text messages, it requires only that I open it and in it directly. If I close it, I cannot receive any message, so please do something about it.

I'd easily give this app 100 stars if it worked with my Samsung 5 Pro watch. Unfortunately, it doesn't, so I have to switch back to the stock app on my phone as well as on the watch. I'm so sad, because the Textra Android app is WONDERFUL as a stand-alone phone app. I'm sure I'll be able to give 5 stars as soon as a watch app is available.",4

com.textra,Greg Nakagawa,"Until recently I would say it's been a 5* app - but for about a month now, no audible notification sound, only vibrate - despite ALL settings in Android and Textra showing there should be sound. I have seen other users are experiencing the same, someone said since 2.51 update on 7/20,which is about when both my wife and I started noticing it. Galaxy s22+ and s22 Ultra. Obviously a text app without sound is pretty worthless.",2

com.textra,Jack Lynn,"Crashes a lot, days textra is not responding. Doesn't always receive messages. I get picture text messages about 1 hour after they are sent super annoying in the group message.

Never had a problem until recently, every other text is being flagged as not sent even though the recipient is receiving the message. Then the app tries re-sending the message or picture and it sends it twice. Very frustrating to get a notification after every text I send that my message failed to send. I dont know if it was a recent update that has caused the issue, but its getting worse. Before this all started the app was great.",5

I am glad I did, as I've found it to be the best text app available for my needs. I highly recommend TEXTRA to everyone.",5
com.textra,Dan Kresan,I've been using textra for 7 years and it has been my favourite. I had my first problem with the app ever recently after moving to a new phone. Support responded to my problem in 10 minutes and had the problem fixed lickity-split. Don't be afraid to pony up a couple dollars for this app. Money well spent.,5
com.textra,Sonia R Velasquez,"7/9/2022 Still love this app. Love the new react to text feature. Really love the app. Love the customisable colors. Love the signature and group feature. For some reason, Galaxy S10 does not have those features. Ridiculous. Anyhoo, this is the best text app I've come across, so far.",5
com.textra,ReadyForThe80s,I love the colour customisations and that there are constant updates. Good to know there are people working to maintain and impove the application. I really love that it shows the times when messages were sent and recieved because reception in my kitchen isn't always reliable.,5
com.textra,Chris Salas,Been using Textra for years and love it. Does everything I need it to and doesn't get in the way. GREAT customer support if you have the Pro version. Had a problem and heard back with the solution within minutes.,5
com.textra,HopeflRomantc,"Update: 8/29/22 - The notification sound is back and working. It was MY FAULT. I had message notifications set to ""deliver quietly"". **silly me** Thank you!! I love Textra! Got it several years ago on recommendation from my sister and have been using ever since.",5
com.textra,Anony Mous,"Textra has been my default messaging app for so many years, I lost count. I love that the paid version is for life so when I switch devices I don't worry. All the updates are great. I have no complaints whatsoever.",5
com.textra,James Darren Hicks,I love the app. I just wish there was in the app a way for you to personalize each message that goes out to a group with a personalized name to the recipient. Otherwise this app is one of the best messaging apps that I have used with an Android phone.,5
com.textra,John Tabares,Can you please explain how to turn off the pop up bubble. Very annoying. I turned it off in the app (android setting) but it still shows. Edit: developer responded quickly and resolved the issue. Thanks!,5
com.textra,Edna Carney,"I just downloaded this App, after reading many of your great ratings. I was pleased with it , until I got to my Contacts and discovered that multiple Spam Risk contacts and Telemarketers contacts were loaded among my Contacts, during installation of your App. I have been unable to remove or delete them from the App. Without uninstalling the App. They must be removed.",3
com.textra,Quesa McLeod,"As of 7/13, I am unable to place a call using the call button in the textra contact screen. When you click call, it links to my email account(s) on the phone. Otherwise, app works great for me.",4
com.textra,nukaie,"I normally don't write reviews, but i wanted to share how I absolutely love this app. I never had any complications whatsoever using it and I love how customizable it is. You can change font, bubble color, emojis etc. I also never had any type of delay. Nice and smooth 10/10 recommended 👍🏻",5
com.textra,Juan de Torres,"Truly useful. Makes me look like I learned to write when I went to school. Is bilingual without having to switch between languages. Applies accented characters accordingly. Writes Spanglish and made-up slang, recognizes when I'm using it. Totally intuitive. Only once had to use support. Immediately received response from a knowledgeable, charming, bilingual agent. Not enough space for praise. Can't live without it. Highly recommend the greatest invention since the invention of Santa Claus",5
com.textra,Alison Porter,I have used Textra for years now. I have tried almost every app out there and this is the best by far. I especially like being able to control a delay time before a message sends. Helpful to say the least!,5
com.textra,Nick Ruedi,Love it! switched to paid version not too long ago and haven't had a single complaint! great amount of customization and it fixed my poor picture quality issue the standard texting app was causing! thanks dev team keep up the good work!,5
com.textra,Octavio Hernandez,"Oh gosh, this review is well overdue! I've been a textra pro user for YEARS! I love that the app is updated regularly, and even with my new smart watch, I can receive notifications and not have to update my default messaging app. The customization feature is awesome!",5
com.textra,Ryan Casey,"Best Android texting service out there. Custom conversations and themes, reactions, scheduled texts, quick replies.. this app has it all! Been using it for years, tried other apps out of curiosity and they have never come close. You need this app!",5
com.textra,Joel Woolery,"Very good messaging app. Fast and accurate voice translation. Sometimes have trouble transmitting pictures, but overall I like it, that's why I have the premium version.",5
com.textra,Tom Toles,"Textra is superior to the run-of-the-mill stock messaging apps. (I've tried most of them). It is easier to use and has many more features -- plus it is free. The developers obviously have found ways to improve what was already a great app, and I anticipate that will continue. I'm very happy to give it my highest rating, and I am very picky.",5
com.textra,Scott Pollard,This is a great app! I got this app for the scheduled texting and the group texting. It allows me to write a text and it will send it at a scheduled time. Great for reminders. I can make groups and name them which helps me know that I'm sending it to the right group.,5
com.textra,Gena Osborne,"When I originally pd for the premium version of Textra, I did so because I wanted to print my texts wirelessly from my printer. The app no longer prints text. I downloaded the link to correct it and sent in a complaint but cannot access my log anymore to choose texts to print. Anyone know of a different app that prints texts that I can try?",3
com.textra,Jimmer B.,"I love the way you can customize Textra and it's ease of use. I like that the team there keeps working to bring the best features to the app, and I look forward to addition of the reaction feature.",5
com.textra,Katrinia McGuire,"What I love about Textra is that it allows me to set auto signatures. I can set as many as I want. I have one for work, one for my friends, one for my kids, one for my husband, etc. It's always difficult if a client texts me and I don't know who they are. Now they see who I am and they are getting the hint! One thing though, I wish Textra allowed auto replies. When I go in vacation, I have to switch to my phone carrier's messenger. I don't like that!",4
com.textra,Mr. Campbell,"I've got the paid version to do away with ads, and it's good! Been a Textra user for as long as I can remember. Solid app, haven't had any technical issues. Hope to be a user for years to come.",4
com.textra,Thomas -,I've used Textra for years now but the lack of a spam blocker it has forced me to change apps now. The robotexts just keep switching phone numbers so I have to block each one. 4-5 a day now so I switched apps and they stopped. Hopefully this will be addressed and I can return to Textra as overall it's a better app. For those who do not have an issue with Spam texts I gladly give Textra 5 Stars.,2
com.textra,Annie Daley,I love it! I was able to personalize my message notifications so the wouldn't be the same as my other notifications.,5
com.textra,homewrecker44,The new undelete feature seems to leave a persistent icon in the notification bar showing there is still a text message even though the actual message has been deleted. Have to manually clear the notification all the time now which is super annoying.,3
com.textra,Abhishek Dubey,This app is totally fake it does't work at all i request to play store app to delet it from play store and reduce one scam app from the app store because it scams the people who belive that app will work but it wont happen in real and the people right good reviwes without knowing that app is not working they all should stop doing that this if the app was not deleted from play store then i have to do something more for deleting the app from play store. Pls report this aap thanks.,1

com.textra,David Groenig,Pro user they have changed their notification sound to be controlled by android not by them I can still choose what I want to hear but notification of text is now other media also on my phone which is c***. Would be nice if they got control of their app back I'm not happy with it anymore,3
com.textra,Matt Mrva,"Changing from 2 stars to 5. My issue was that when I would get multiple group messages all at once it'd freeze up. Figured out it's either Verizon or android, but it happens on Google messages and android messages, which textra is way better than both. Sorry textra!",5
com.textra,Mario Flores,Started using Textra a few years ago because of a single corrupted contact issue with the stock Samsung text app. I liked it so much that I've installed it in every new phone since. Nice customization options and it just works.,5
com.textra,Susanna,"Excellent app, works great, intuitive, great support too. Thank you!",5
com.textra,John Constantine,Still love it. The only fault I've found is that you can't add people to an existing chat. That a pretty important and basic feature.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Handles MMS better than the messaging app bundled with Android 11. I would give it six stars if only it worked on my Galaxy 4 watch.,5
com.textra,John Addington II,Love having a texting app that is so customizable. Really makes me want to use it over the 2 that came installed with my new phone.,5
com.textra,Devon Manska,"Slightly above average and I paid for the Premium version. Messages keep having to be resent multiple times despite having good service and WiFi. Edit: default messaging app works, Textra is still giving me problems 9/18/2022",1

com.textra,Girl Blessed,"Textra is the best! Easy to use. I like that I can label a group and be able to text that group by its label right in the app! So user friendly its a no-brainer. Plus, it is continually adding improvements!",5
com.textra,Michael Both,"Since the more recent updates it no longer shows or finds messages from certain contacts UNLESS you write a new message to them, after which they again become invisible. Only affects Textra not other message apps. VERY frustrating.",3
com.textra,John Graham,"The update today bugged the camera during texts, please fix ASAP and I'll give 5 stars. Everything about this app is perfect other than this new bug",2

com.textra,Kimberlin Detz,"I've been a LONG time supporter, like 2015/2016 time. I love the customization in texting apps, it makes it so much better to know who is texting you before you even have your phone. I just find it's lost valuable features (to me) recently and I find myself looking for a new text app to replace those features but nobody can do it like you. If those features could be added back then hell yeah. I miss the custom vibration pattern- simple but effective& I miss the colourful icons per notification.",5
com.textra,Michael Miller,Great texting app. conversations can be customized easily. Only thing I would love to see added would be the ability to add or drop someone from a thread.,5
com.textra,Jon Jenkins,"Best SMS App, hands down. Developer very active. Features excellent. Love the delayed send function - gives me a chance to realise I'm about to send a message to the wrong person. Great customisation. Just get it and pay for pro. You won't regret it.",5
com.textra,David Buteau,"Another update to my review of Textra. I had a very big problem after the last update and gave them a terrible review.

Very professional. I was blown away. Thank you JASON and thank you TEXTRA... I am now an even bigger fan!",5

com.textra,Don Poenisch,"I really love the customization options in the app. It has functioned as expected so far.

So at this point, I am very happy with the app.",5

Also, I have tried clearing cache, and re-sync so far.",5
com.textra,Mark,Still my go to texting app for Android. Been using for years. Main issue I have is the size of the app. Takes up nearly 5gigs of data. Wish there was a way to clear that up without wiping out all my settings,4

Not only that - their support response is remarkably quick and informative. Highly recommended,5

The only thing I wish it had was something above the conversations in the main screen so it wasn't so full of text. Even just 20-30% of the screen worth of blank space with the word ""Textra"" in it would make it seem less cluttered. Otherwise it's a perfect app and you SHOULD be using it.",4

com.textra,Anthony Persichini,This is the best text messaging app out. When an iPhone likes a message Textra converts it to an reaction icon. I use a Garmin smart watch and this is the only messaging app that allows you to mark a message read from the watch. Paying for pro is worth it.,5

com.textra,Annex M,"Great Texting app. One problem though. I bought this app for $4.99+ tax and got a new number, so now if I want the pro. It's asking for money again. Can you have the app search for purchases with email, not the phone number? 5 Stars if you can restore my purchase",3

com.textra,A Google user,"I really like the app, but I don't know why the Textra Heads Up isn't showing anymore. It's one of the features that I've been looking forward to. It worked for like the first day only. But now, it doesn't work on anymore, BOTH locked and unlocked. When I try the trial testing button to see how I set the notifications (the ""play"" button in Customize Notifications), the heads-up works. But when I receive a text, it doesn't. I hope you can fix this :(",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Definite improvement on the big standard SMS app included on my phone, which had been playing up. My only gripe is that despite setting it to ping and flash the notification light, the light doesn't come on, so I have to check if I hear a noise whether it's a message or just some random notification from another app. Adverts are very intrusive. I never notice them at all, which is good.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app. It's simple and straightforward, but also comes with lots of options to personalize as you like, without becoming unnecessarily busy or complicated. Tiny ads in the free version are not at all intrusive. Plus, I had a recent glitch with messages after travelling and they wrote back right away and solved it no problem. Can't ask for more than that - highly recommended.",5
com.textra,Len Christiansen,"I especially like the feature that plays the notification sound even when you are already in a conversation stream. Early versions of Android did that, but it hasn't been available for a long time. That is what sent me looking for a replacement for messages. Although I was looking for that feature specifically, there are tons of other great features in Textra! I highly recommend it.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the app, mainly for it's customizable abilities compared to the default. I habe the full version as well. However, the one thing I miss from my default app is to be able to use a picture or colour for the texting screen's background instead of just light or dark! I love customizing my phone, so perhaps that's a feature that could be added in the future! 😊",5
com.textra,Stuart Canty,Looks good. One thing I don't like is sending a new text. It would be better if when you select new message it would go to your contacts. Going to recent doesn't make much sense. It's not needed as it already opens on that page. Having to select a tick box then another tick is counter productive. I've tried about twenty apps now and none are really quick to use.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I would give you 10 stars, but it's impossible.  Respect man, whoever you are. This is a perfect example that people with talent for designing aplications exist and you can have everything you wish in one place, one apk. Very intuitive., has more than one can expect and it's so simple in use.   There is no better sms/mms apk on the internet. True. Thank you for this one. It is Literally Perfect. Glad I found it. I will stay and won't ever change it. Keep on going and wish you all the best :)",5
com.textra,Caila Baker Lechicky,"This app is super fast. I have a lot of texts stored and there is no lag at all! One major downfall for me is that there is no notification when someone sends a MMS. In order for me to receive MMS, I have to have my data turned on (not wifi). So because there is no notification, I have no clue someone has sent a photo until I need to turn data on for something. I tried the ""turn off wifi and enable data"" in settings and it doesn't work. PLEASE add notifications for incoming MMS!!",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I never even considered using a non-stock so l app to text until I found Textra. There are so many options and ways to customize your experience; it's wonderful. My personal favourite features are delayed sending (gives you a second or more in case you hit send by accident) and scheduled sending. I use it all the time in case I want to send something but not in the middle of the night, or if I need to send someone a reminder or update but don't want to forget. Textra is really worth trying out.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"(UPDATED) The developer responds timely to issues encountered, which is highly appreciated. This would be the best SMS app I've ever used, highly customizable with a lot of nifty functions I've never thought I could have for a messaging app. Not to mention it takes up way less space than my phone's default app. I love that I can schedule texts, even send conversations in emails for backup. And yes, I love customizing colors. So many functions I haven't fully explored, but so far it's great!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I was very happy with Textra and used it without a problem for over a year until mid-January when it stopped sending texts. Sometimes the texts wouldn't go through at all, other times, although it said the text hadn't gone through and I tried to re-send (only to be told again it hadn't gone through), it actually had been sent and the recipient then received the text several times where I kept trying to re-send it.  From other recent reviews it seems I'm not the only person with this problem so it appears to be a bug in the app as we are all on different phones and carriers. (I am on a Huawei P9, Sky Mobile)  Regrettably I have had to delete the app due to this problem.",1
com.textra,chrystalline padlan,"I would like to ask for an assistance to check the bug of this application. By viewing some of the reviews, I think it is really the application that has a problem. I can't receive text messages. Tried to use my default SMS App and I receive the text but when I switch to Textra, no messages appears specially when the screen is off. Please fix this bug as soon as possible. This is the only app I liked because of the customization of the app. I already sent an e-mail.",2
com.textra,Tony Peters,"This app is really great for personalizing one's conversations. You can set different vibrations and sounds for different people, including ones you can download and create. It has automatic day-time-night-time modes, and you can set how the pop-up notification acts. It is a really great app; the only downside is it doesn't handle quite as nicely as the default Samsung Messages in certain areas, but I think the pros outweigh the cons.",4
com.textra,A Google user,For a while I've been jumping between Samsung and Google Messages. Both of them were frankly unpleasing to the eye and very uncustomizable. Then I found Textra and that changed everything. This is an amazing app that works perfectly for what I need. I can customize settings for single conversations or all conversations. It also is just a beautiful app. Well designed and easy to use. I love that I can change basically every setting I could ever think of and more. Highly recommend!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Wonderful texting app with great ability to customize. You can change your notification icon, your sounds, your LED colour, conversation colour, even your phone vibration pattern, even lets you send test messages to make sure all is well. Best part is it's not too difficult to understand so anyone will be able to grasp the interface. 1 small problem: keep up to date. App can fail to let you know you've gotten a message if you don't keep it up to date. I never pay for apps, this one I did.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I downloaded this app because I hated the standard look for Android texting and wanted to customize the look. For that purpose, this is great! I dont want to pay just so I can have purple speech bubbles in my texts...so I opted for the free version with ads. Most ads are text based and unintrusive, so it's perfectly fine. However I've recently started getting display ads, a bright orange Amazon banner. That is intrusive... not sure if this is a recent change? Please get rid of display ads.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I switched from the Samsung text app to Textra when I was unable to customize anything without using one of Samsung's lame themes. I really appreciate the customizability of this app. Texting is easy and straightforward. I have only had a couple of issues when sending a photo, if I added a text message with the picture, the contact did not receive it. I have to send the photo separately, and then a text comment. Ads are not intrusive, though I have accidentally clicked on them a few times.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I really love Textra and I've been using it for a long time now. I love the customization to it and how I can have different variations for different conversations. The only complaint I have, is that occasionally it will glitch and someone will text me one thing, and I'll get a glitched version of a text that the person sent months ago. So sometimes conversations can be confusing, but it honestly only happens once in a blue moon and can sometimes be hilarious.",4
com.textra,Devesh Prabhu,"A good app. I have used this for two years intermittently. The latest version has more features than I require. I feel that other than this version and the paid one, there should be a lite version just catering to simple SMS services. I feel it has become bloated with advance features. Due to this, I have moved over to Chomp SMS and their free version gives me what I need and it is enough for me. There a ton of customizability options and I won't be needing those or using those anytime soon.It's a good app, but way too much for my taste and I like this app though.",4
com.textra,A Google user,I've had this app now for about a month and I really like it.  It has lots of options that some of the competitors don't include.  I originally found this app because I wanted to delay the sending of sms messages.  It has that option and so much more.  Another great feature is it's ability to delay a sent message for a few seconds.  This gives me a chance to read and cancel it if necessary.  I also ran into an issue with the app.  It turns out there was a 3rd party app interfering with textra.  The tech support department had it resolved within a few hours of the problem arising.  This app is worth becoming a pro member.,4
com.textra,Taylor Self,"I really like this app because I can fully customize everything to look appealing to my eye. One thing I would love them to add is a schedules text feature. Sometimes I need to text someone later, and I've been setting reminders in my phone instead of being able to schedule it through the app. I was using an app previously that allowed me to do this and it was a great feature.",4
com.textra,Pac,"This has to be the best Texting application out there, I have tried many over the years but this has to be the best. Communication with developer is simple and they always respond kindly. You can personalize most settings and make it as individual as you like. it is intuitive and easy to use with some great features lacking in other apps. The developer is very easy to contact and will discuss any possible changes you may want implemented. 10/10 from me.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Really great app. I hated the stock Android text message app , how it forces pictures sent to me into a separate message thread no matter what I do. Hated it! this is a good replacement and has many nice features. Very slick looking theme and functions. After the trial a small ad appears at the top but it is not intrusive like those ads placed at the bottom of apps that mimic buttons to trick you into clicking. Would recommend this app for sure. I tried a bunch of other ones and deleted them",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is by far the best texting app I've used. You can customize colour, font style and size, emoji style, bubble size, and basically anything else you want to. You can search for old messages with keywords or by date. There's no pop up ads and the app has never crashed on me. It also allows me to take scrolling screenshots every time, whereas my stock texting app glitches and only takes a screen and a half. I would honestly recommend this app to anyone.",5
com.textra,Michelle Waddick,"I've had this app for a few years now and hands down my favourite part of this app is the ability to schedule a text!! There has been many times when i think of something i need to tell someone in the middle of the night, so rather than risk texting and waking them up, i schedule a text to arrive in the morning. Its fantastic!!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I have found Textra to be a pretty much flawless app! I've been using it for over a month now on a Samsung S7. It is very customizable and integrates seamlessly with the other functions of the phone. I have had no problems with it at all. Once you learn the interface it's very easy to use and customize. Adds are very unobtrusive and do not appear when you're composing a text, only at the top of the message summary screen (one line). I would definitely recommend it!",5
com.textra,Sniper PD,"I downloaded this app today because I gave up on trying to set the Messages app so I received an audible alert when I received a message. Textra app settings are so logical and not all over the place. Within 2 minutes of downloading it I had sent a message and received a message all emitting an audible alert. The delay send, 0 to 8 seconds, was an unexpected bonus and it could save me from having to apologise for the previous message. Two other features I must try is the group send and adding a saved signature to all messages. So far, so good. I haven't played around with the features yet so there may be more delights to come.",5
com.textra,discoelephant 64 (discoelephant64),"This app is infuriating. It sometimes sends texts, sometimes doesn't. Handles MMS messages terribly. And it won't even retrieve texts, sometimes for days. I have to restart my phone constantly just to receive texts. I'm going to delete it, I've given it a year and it just seems to get worse. It's just too frustrating. The features are nice, but if it can't do the main feature, which is texting, then what's the point?",2
com.textra,A Google user,"Used to work great and have been using Textra for years now, even bought Pro. I love Textra, but the recent MMS issues with either Android or my phone have just turned me right off. The app works great for a few days to a week and then I get sending timeout errors on pictures and group messages that never go away. The messages get sent but I get an error message back, which gets old after awhile. The internet goes back and forth on whether this is a Textra issue or an Android issue. I have been through every fix I could find. This does not happen with other texting apps like Samsung's stock message app or Google's messaging app. I went thorough support a few times and they seem to run in circles trying to isolate the issue. On the third set of diagnostics and starting from scratch to find the issue I honestly just gave up and moved on. I would love to keep using this as my main messaging app, but after several months of hoping it would get fixed I am jumping ship. The odd part is it works flawlessly on my wife's S9....but not on my Note 9. Same version of Android and all. It's a great app with tons of customization and I will miss it.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Installed the app to get the ""schedule text"" feature, which is great. There are 2 problems: to schedule an outgoing text, you need to select Textra as your default SMS app. I wouldn't mind that, if it had all the basic features the Google Messages app has, but unfortunately you cannot archive conversations or hide them from the main screen. That second issue kind of turned me off using Textra on a daily basis. I'll keep it installed for the scheduling feature but there is no chance I'll use the app regularly until I can archive conversations without deleting them.",3
com.textra,Francis Acsisi,"On the notification panel, if you can include the option to mark a conversation as read (instead of replying only). Sometimes I don't want to reply to a message but I also don't want to open the app, so I just mark it as read. Second, when previewing 2 messages from the same sender, and the messages are long, I need a way in which I can swipe the notification or tap it to briefly view the multiple messages and without opening the text message. Otherwise I really love the app",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using Textra for more than a year already bec. of its various features, from personalizing everything to scheduled messages, etc. Their team has also been very helpful whenever I encountered problem or confusion with the app. This is truly a highly recommendable app for those who want to have a more personalized messaging app with a lot of extra features to offer. And again, an excellent support team to assist you. Keep up the good work guys! Thanks!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This app has so many features, but I wish it didn't have a few of them. For the longest time one friend couldn't receive my pictures. I found the setting and fixed that but in the process I changed another setting that caused long text to convert. Well if they don't have data, they don't get the text. Way too many features that don't really need to be changed from the default app on the phone. I never had any issues before. I think I have it right now.  But this is still one of the best texting apps out there",5
com.textra,David Wicks,"I am really pleased that I found this texting app! Not only is it visually very configurable (varied colours, text sizes, etc.), but when I recently had an issue with delivery receipts the help desk got back to me - with a solution - within 24 hours. It's great to use an app. on which I can get advise / help so quickly!! With the increased use of One-Time-Passwords I welcome the new emboldening function. Let's hope it works as well as it sounds it should! I actually can't think of anything to criticise regarding its performance on my Moto G7.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I really like this app. The fact you can even change the icon colour is epic. However, it needs a copy code button on certain notifications that send through codes. Most texting apps offer this feature as standard, but you don't seem to have it, which can be annoying when trying to authorise your own access to accounts or whatever as they're not always just 4 characters long.",4
com.textra,Colton Lockridge,"It's a cool app, customizable and pretty but one major and one minor issue. Minor issue, how come you can't attach a video, you have to do a runaround. Major issue, we have a family member where if an emergency happens (they have a condition) we have to be notified immediately. I woke up to no messages, turns out 12 had been sent. Switched to Samsung Messages, they loaded. I can't have this happening. Not okay.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"This is a fantastic app but I wasn't aware that when I had downloaded it, I only had an ad-free trial version. After 2 weeks ads began popping up, which were unexpected, but the $5 fee for the lifetime ad-free version is totally worth it. I especially love the personal notification sound option for each contact as well as the gorgeous colour palette personalization. I highly recommend this app but wish that the developers let you know that the initial download is a free trial and that there's an option to buy the ad-free version right at the beginning",5

I love the customization and have never had an issue with bugs or crashing in the years I've been using it. I can't praise Textra enough. In the future, I would love to see them push the customization even further with picture and/or patterned backgrounds, but I am pleased as punch with it enough as it is.",5

Can you please fix an incompatibility with Edge Gesture that when the latter is enabled, I can't use the + button on the left corner to add emojis or contact when replying. Pressing it does nothing. Many thanks.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using this for 3 years now. Just got a new phone and tried out Samsung's preinstalled text app but I still ended up going with Textra again. It's clean, easy to use, it has handy swipe shortcuts, and my overall experience has been great. It does have one single ad at the top if you don't pay, but it's not annoying or anything. Since I've been using Textra for this long I'll probably just pay to get rid of it now.",5
com.textra,Avinash Mohan,"I've been using Textra for 3-4 years now, and I've never had any issues at all. Beautifully designed, provides me with more than enough customisability, and I'm really pleased with some of the smaller but important features - such as swiping across the notifications screen to mark texts as read, the easy to use pop up screens that work even while using other apps...the list goes on. The clean interface, imo, is the best thing about this. Five stars! Thank you! :)",5
com.textra,A Google user,"So far, love the app. The free version has adds after a short trial period, but they are unobtrusive and can easily be ignored. The only improvement I would suggest would be the ability to customiza message backgrounds. Samsung used to have that feature a couple updates ago, and it's something that I have missed. Otherwise, a lot of customizable options, and overall a very sturdy messaging app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Wanted to customize my notifications sounds and found this app. Love the way you can customize your sounds, colours, bubbles, notifications. You can even delay sending a text by a few seconds or even program it to send the next day. I am not good with Technology and had a small issue with how to move my notification sounds and their tech help was helpful and willing to help me. Not Sure how much it will cost but if it’s reasonable I will buy. I also like that you can “play”:with the app before having to purchase it. It’s Easy to use and I love...love it!!!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"It's ok, but I can't seem to turn off floating notifications. I use ""SMS Pop Up"" to deal with notifications for my messages app, but when I click on the notification, I want it to open the full Textra app not a floating window. Can't seem to find the upgrade to pro option, as I do not want ads tracking me. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to remove the ""Textra"" text from the top of the main view screen.",3
com.textra,Makhan Roti,New to this app but the specific thing I was after doesn't work. I need an app to allow text messages in masses to more than 20 persons in one go. So it appears to allow this but fails to send. Now standard text sends the messages to everyone else even if amongst them some numbers fail. This app appears to fail the entire batch.. and I have no idea which number(s) are failing. Update: instant support. Issue resolved by setting the group messages setting to bulk. Cool.,5
com.textra,Lionel Yeo,"I'm unclear why the Textra(not Android) Heads-Up Notification feature was removed in Android 11. It could undoubtedly still be kept as an option, for people who still wish to use it. It is useful in the sense that, you could not only define custom actions, you can also set how long you wish the Heads-Up Notifications to stay on screen. I have downgraded to version 4.29, the last version which has this function, and it clearly still works as intended in Android 11. Pls consider adding it back.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"The only thing that stopped me from giving this wonderful app 5 stars is twofold. The excessive amount of hideous blood-red, same shades repeated, on both ends of the spectrum. This means far fewer choices of shades in other colours. What a shame. When I choose 'allow Textra to choose colours' I get the same, no variety, including a preponderance of hideous blood-red. So I use my own. It even has tips, pretty good.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"it is a great application that beats the manufacturer's default hands down.  Except for some unknown reason there is no archive capability.  I do not need to keep all of these messages in the active view but do like to go back.  this deficiency has me looking for a real full service application.  It's unfortunate Textra refuses to listen to its Users' feedback in over 2 years, do  not pay for the premium if they cannot get this basic requirement active.",1
com.textra,A Google user,The app is a great messaging app. I love that i can customize the colours easily for my messages as well as individual friends. The only thing I don't like is how long it takes to search a conact when trying to send a new text. It takes around 30 seconds for contacts to show up once I've typed the name in the seach box.,4
com.textra,Ryan Remus,I love textra and have been using it for years. But recently I upgrade my phone to the S21 Ultra and I have found two features that no longer work. The first one is that the option for keeping conversation open in window view once you hit send no longer works. Second problem I have found is that it no longer supports custom vibrations. This wouldn't be such an issue if it just followed whatever system vibration you have set but instead uses it's own vibration that is just a 3 second long buzz.,2
com.textra,Kirstyn,"I have been using this app for at least 4 years now.. Ever since I made the switch from Apple to Android. I didn't like the default app on my phone for messaging because I couldn't customize my contacts. This app makes customization so easy with tons of color, bubble, font, font size and emoji options. Whenever I get a new phone, I make sure to install this app. They are always updating and listening to feedback!",5
com.textra,Christo Wepener,"Nice and easy to use once you get used to the interface. The blocklist is the feature which draws me most to this product. I would suggest the following enhancements: 1. import/export settings, especially for the blocklist. 2. I noticed that the blocklisted SMS's are not actually deleted at the service provider like other deleted SMS's when I swapped phones. They all re-appeared on the new phone.",4
com.textra,Rob Mc,"For anyone looking for a new messaging app. This one's perfect. The reason I picked it was because I'm always sending gif files and pictures. My default app always put a cap on the amount I could send. This one lets me live my life. I've been using Textra for years. I have no complaints. Just buy the full version to remove adds. It cost less than a cheeseburger, and no app that actually benefits you is free. Someone put effort in to make it for you. Flip 'em a couple bucks.",5
com.textra,A. Gammage,"This text messaging app works far better than the app that was supplied with my new phone. A banner ad appears at the top of the app when opened after the free trial but it's not an intrusive size at all. In settings, I can see if each message is sent and delivered. Many customizing options. Excellent. **Update: Over a year later - still using Textra and still loving it! 👍",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Best SMS/MMS app by far. Love it. Very little wrong with it, all of it subjective. Great support. Almost 4 years later and I still think it's one of the best SMS apps or there by far. Only two issues. 1. I wish there was a setting that when group SMS are received you can by default only reply to the sender 2. When using signatures being able to choose from a list at the message composition stage.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra was recommended to me by a friend. I really love it because of the cancel send button and customizable themes and colors. But there is room for improvement. I hope that viewing timestamps can be done automatically and does not nees to swipe right or click the information icon in the bubble. Because sometimes the timestamp that is 'automatically seen' (no need to swipe right or click info icon) can be misleading to be the time for succeeding or previous messages. Some messages have timestamp while others dont have. It can be misleading if you are in a big hurry or emergency or a lot of stress. I also hope thay when i go to the contact list app of the phone and click a contact then click message function, i hope the textra app goes into full screen mode automatically instead of clicking the option button then clicking Open in App. Thank you very much and have a nice day!",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Reviewing it because the nice bot asked me. Textra is pretty great. I have exceedingly few problems with this app, and the ones that I do have are either minor, or easily fixed. Sometimes photos won't arrive or send properly, and I think it's Textra's fault, then I realize that I'm stupid and just need to turn on my mobile data. I've had three different phones and I've had Textra on all of them, usually installed on day one. Sometimes ads get in my way, but that's pretty predictable. Great app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is a life-changer. I'd been using this for years when I had to switch to the default sms app to work on a new smartwatch. I immediately missed its fast response & very convenient features like scheduled texting. Upon upgrading to a new phone, I had to use a new default app which had even less features. Thankfully, we found a way to pair the smart watch w/ Textra this time and it worked! It even works better than the SMS app of the watch brand. Thanks for the efficiency & great features!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Good messaging app. I like the black background with white letters which probably saves on battery power by having the screen mostly black. Makes your texts very easy to read. You only have to deal with one ad which appears as your first text after the free trial period, which is very reasonable and acceptable. Highly recommended!",4
com.textra,Tom Masterson,"I've been using Textra for years, and I prefer it over every other texting app I've come across. There are regular updates adding new features, and they've never removed or changed anything unnecessarily. The features (like scheduling a text to send later) paired with the incredibly easy to use interface and customizability makes Textra one of my core apps. The free version's ads aren't intrusive at all; I paid for the ad-free version just to support the developers. I highly recommend this app!",5
com.textra,Todd Scott,"Nice app for texting but.... if you continue to use the free version, when the adds update, the app will close your text message box and kick you back to the main screen so you see the add and erasing whatever you spent time typing in. There is also no way to change the font size. Edit: But I am not using Quick Reply window. Regular texting screen. Thank you for pointing out where the font size can be changed. Finger gestures to increase and decrease font would be more useful.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app except it doesn't show the length of you message, or how many characters are left. Crazy this basic thing is not there. Maybe there is an option to turn it on but I can't find it. Update: found the option on contact list page. It would be nice if the option was on by default and options available from within a conversation.",5
com.textra,Andrei Cosma,"Great app when it works. It's much more customisable than the stock app. But it seems that sometimes I can't send sms from it, I just get ""message delivery failed"" and I have to resend it 3-4 times for it to actually get sent. I tried the stock app when I had this problem and it works, so it's not a carrier problem. Unfortunately I can't use it like this as it seems unreliable, but when it worked I really enjoyed it, it's much better than the stock app. Maybe it will get fixed some day",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Couldn't rate this app more highly. It is so feature rich and customisable it's unbelievable. From individual colours for chats to media lists per contact to the way your messages pop up on screen, the list goes on. Integrates seamlessly with Android for media sharing. Upgraded to full app within a week as these guys deserve support. Talking of which, the support is second to none. Responsive, quick and attentive. Try it and free your messaging experience!",5
com.textra,A Google user,Ive been using this app for years now and i absolutely love it. Loved it so much i became a pro user to get rid of ads. So many customization features like you can assign colors and icons to people so you know exactly who it is before even opening the message. Its a smooth experience and i havent been able to find a messaging app that even comes close to this. Highly recommended this one and going with the Pro version to get rid of ads.,5
com.textra,Tomáš Jiříček,"The app is fine, but... 1) ""Split long messages"" feature is terrible, makes the message very hard to read. 2) There is the feature to use only simple diacritics which is fine, I miss something to replace emojis though with the old-school ones (if possible). 3) App is a bit slower compared to the Android built in app. At least in some situations (replies). BTW I'm not happy to send you an email with the information. Just take the notes from here, if you're willing to improve the aop.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Great app! Excellent functionality. I originally downloaded b/c I needed to block ex-txts and this does that and so much more. And the custom colors are fun too. Update: I had a techy difficulty I could not figure out and contacted support. They were fantastic! Super quick response and issue solved very quickly. This app is a keeper and I'm a happy Pro user.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"First off I paid for the app to support the developers as I think this is the best texting app available. Great job, been using it for a few years now and not looking to switch to anything else. The only suggestion I have is that guys PLEASE make us to choose the TEXT colour too (like we can choose from the variety of colours for message bubbles).only 4 colours available. Give us an opportunity to chose from the same colours as we do for the bubbles. I hope it comes in the next update. Thank you and keep up with the good work you do",5
com.textra,A Google user,"App is great, only problem is I can't find a way to change the heads up notification text size. I used to be able to read almost a whole text message in the heads up bubble, but text size has increased (new update feature?) and I cant read as much of a text now. Its iritating, as I can change the text size for everything else but cant find an option to change the size of that. Edit * It has also made it so the textra heads up buttons aren't all readable, if I turn on all 3 buttons the first two are shown and the third is shortened as ""Op..."" Instead of ""Open App""",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I was really disappointed when the stock Android app stopped having custom text notifications. I looked for alternatives, and picked Textra. I have no complaints. After using Textra for about six months, with custom text notifications and colour schemes for my various contacts, I went ahead and paid to remove ads. If Textra carries on as it is, I can't imagine I'd switch back or use anything else.",5
com.textra,Don Gowan,"I finally found a texting app with ALL the features I've been looking for! The ability to pin conversations to the top of screen was the clincher for me. However, a feature that allows you to send a msg after a customizable time delay is a game changer for me. No more auto correct typos get sent. You can quickly scan your msg while its being queued to send, and stop it if you notice an error. Brilliant! I will never use the phone's built in app again.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app, but messages view should show the sender/receiver photo icons beside each message like the stock apps do. It's a constant and necessary eyes-on visual indicator to know / remind you just who it is you are about to send a text to. Also, there should be an option to enable the time stamps to be always visible instead of constantly having to slide to the left to make them visible.... and an option to set the text size for the time stamps...separate from the message text size. - EDIT - Well, given the fact that the developers of this app are actually reading these reviews and responding to them (Some don't); I will most happily adjust my review to 5 stars .",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Best messaging app I had used so far for my Huawei Nova 3i. Better than the standard messaging app. I personally liked the feature that you can change the theme color of every conversation (And the notification color changes too) as well as the feature when you can see what was the time you have received a text message and what was the actual time it was sent by the sender. Therefore, you'll get to see if it's a delayed message or not. Great app! Quite stable, not much app crashes too.",5
com.textra,J L,"Really love this App. I like that you can customize each contact with SO many different colour choices, different notification sounds for each person etc. The only thing I wish is that you could zoom in and out on the actual screen to show the messages larger. Other than that totally recommend! Hopefully the creators of this app will read that and make that small change so that we can zoom in on text messages and photos people send.",5
com.textra,JM “Non” Capper,"My go to texting app for a number of years. It has a clear interface, is intuitive, does everything I could possibly want, and easily. So easy to add files such as pictures, to copy text, forward and edit messages. Each development is positive and helpful. I love that I can text ""Tip"" and receive really useful tips, many of which have opened up new uses. I have received prompt and helpful responses from Textra staff. I thoroughly recommend Textra SMS.",5
com.textra,Trang Pham,"I loved and raved about this app for years and for the last few years it's been buggy to the point it's now embarrassing for me. Whether texts are not going through, or indicate they have failed to send, but you get a response to it so you know it was sent, then hearing that the same failed text was sent 3x-4x is embarrassing! Especially when we all use our phones for work nowadays. Please fix, if not I will have to delete this app for good.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"I love textra for its very customizable settings. However, one thing I just notice yesterday. When I tried to schedule a text message for sending at a certain time, the text message was not sent. You'll need to open the app first then the text will be sent. I suggest you create a function that will check the time every minute and compare it to the time set by the user. It should check even if the app is closed, and the text will automatically send once the time set was reached. Please fix this TY",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using this app for a few months after samsung messages(default) stopped notifying me when I received messages after an update and I could not fix it, I decided I couldn't live like that and went looking for an alternative messaging app and installed textra. It has been a fabulous app, very reliable and always notifies me, it has minimal ads and a simple bot to get usage tips from. It also has got customizable settings including look, colours and font. I recommend to give this app a try.",5
com.textra,NMB Recentes,"I've been using this app for a couple of months now and i like it. The only issue that bothers me is when i send group text messages, it always asks me if i allow such action and repeatedly notifying maybe as many as the people tagged on the message. What to do about this? Other than that, i really like this app.. I hope the issue i experienced will be fixed soon. Thanks.",4
com.textra,Rosa Durdle,"Excellent. I love this app for sending scheduled texts and the personalization features. But I do wish it also had a lock function. My kids often borrow my phone to play games and YouTube and such, but I have messages in my text conversations that would not be appropriate for them to access, even accidentally. I hope a locking feature turns up in a future update. So far I've not had luck finding a separate app that works well to protect textra, so having it incorporated would be ideal.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app. Integrates well with Gear S3 and other apps. Shortcuts to GIFs and attachments are awesome. There are a lot of other shortcuts I could do without (calendar, stickers) but they don't degrade my experience. Interface is user friendly and customizable. I haven't had any glitches in nearly two years of use and the updates occur regularly which probably helps with that.",5
com.textra,Steven Hilton,"I've been using this app for a while now, it is highly customisable for the look and feel of the app so you can tailor it to your own colours and design, it has many functions over the standard app that comes with your phone, and receives regular updates from the developer. if your bored with the standard messaging app on your phone, give this one a go. I tried the free version for a while which does have ads to support it but decided to pay for the pro version - I hate advertising.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been running Textra now for almost two weeks, love the many opitions. I've already decided to pay the bargain price for the pro version when trial period finishes. Cons. On the old stock android message app, I had the option to firstly compose my message before selecting the contact. With Textra, that option is not there. I must first select a contact before being allowed to compose my message. Sometimes, I like to compose a text BEFORE select the recipients. Otherwise...it's perfect !",5
com.textra,GJJB 66,"Best app out there for texting. Have been using this through a few phones now for several years. They keep improving it. Features are rich and customizable (takes time up front). I'm still learning new things. Time-lag send counter is a god-send as we always catch that dumb typo or unintended tone right after we hit send... I use 4 seconds, which is just enough. Also custom colors for contacts, and ability to call from the the app, and export texts has been handy. My gold standard",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great and an almost perfect app! I've tried different SMS app but IMHO this is the best so far for dual-sim phones. Most of the feature can be customized (even the ad position for the free version). I just wish the sim selection button color and the sim symbol color underneath the message can be customized too. Having the sim number (1 or 2) is OK but it will be better visually, and easier to identify, if it has different color for each.. Kudos to the developer!",5
com.textra,Matt Cook,"I've been using Textra through 4 different phones as of this review, and I've never seen a reason to switch. The customization is simple and plenty, the search function is reliable, the UI looks great, and the support team is very much on the ball if issues come up (which is exceedingly rare). Highly recommend.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Good. However, I was annoyed that when I sent a text to multiple people, the default setting was to convert it to a media message which meant my provider charged me 46p per message. Luckily my provider texted me to alert me that these weren't included in my plan so I only racked up £3.50 before I changed the setting. Apart from that I like it's simplicity, good level of options and crucially it's support for texting Groups which was an option that has disappeared from my standard texting app.",4
com.textra,CC Outdoors,"Love this app as I can customize so much and makes it far faster for me to type. Mix it with Gboard, with all the settings just right and it's unbeatable. The built in android text message app to me is junk compared to this. I love the pop-up quick reply, so handy!! If I find anything I don't like, I normally report it, I haven't done that yet with this.",5

Textra seems to work much better although I am having issues sometimes sending images. The person I'm sending to is not getting the image but is getting regular text.

This is more than I will likely ever keep on my phone anyways, but now several texts from two months ago went missing that I needed for work. It still had many several months older. Other than that, it's worked far better than pre-installed apps. I now have it set to keep ALL texts. Only thing it needs is the ability to regularly back up everything in a way that can be sorted and searched easily such as online clouds. (paid version)",4
com.textra,A Google user,I've used textra for a couple of years and been very happy with it's features but recently when I send a photo it only comes up with one tick as if it hasn't send yet the receiver comments on the photo.

Other them that I do like the other features.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the textra app and even bought the full version! I would just have a small request which would be awesome for a future release:  You are able to choose how many reminder repetitions you would like (one to fifty) but not the interval between the reminders (always set to 2-minutes)  Would be awesome if I can change the interval from 2-minutes to something else.  Will give 5 stars anyway, because I already love the app. This feature would just make it even better :)",5

I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and it does not have a Signature feature, but, Tuesday I pick up my New S9 Edge Plus.   I'm hoping it has one but either way Textra is going straight on it. I would give it 5 stars but for the fact the Signature text looks exactly the same as the Text message text itself!  Why is that not an option. It would be really useful if the signature was a completely different font and or colour.  I send messages to work colleagues and use the signature to identify myself, but, even after placing lots of spaces when creating the signature it looks just the same as the text message itself.   Why can't we have the actual signature text available in a different font or colour so it is clearly and visibly different from the text message itself?  This would be a very useful feature if you could implement it in an update.",4
com.textra,Jus Stewart,"Almost perfect, and a godsend from a customisation point of view as opposed to Google Messages which has almost none. Do wish we could customise the background of the 'dark' mode to a shade that better matches other Apps I have, but oh well. Also wish there were message swipe options, not really a fan of only having 'call' and the double tap Bin option. Bit limited there. Otherwise though, hard to fault. Great App 😊",4
com.textra,A Google user,"this has a lot of cool features like being able to easily check texts by date in a calendar type view, send messages later, cancel a text before you send it if you feel you made a mistake... so much customisation on it too... the only thing it doesn't have that my default text message app does is the text suggestions where it reads your text message and then gives you quick reply options",5

com.textra,Deryk Howard,Great app!!! So much more customizable that the native Samsung message app. There is nothing you can't do with it. I needed to be able to set up repeat notifications from an important contact (work pager). Textra made it so easy. Highly recommend.

com.textra,A Google user,"Great app, has never missed a beat. Some more personal customisation features might be nice, like being able to choose a photo as your background and some more fonts etc. But other than those minor things it does exactly what it is designed to do! Just hope google don't be selfish and take too long to allow for RCS so a good app doesn't get the shaft.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app with minimal ads that can be easily ignored. They don't force you to watch videos or click on any x's, they are just small rare ads that work in to the app to look like a contact.

After trying to find a replacement for the stock Android messaging app (after it continually refused to compress and send photos whose file size exceeded some mystery limit), I found several apps had major bugs or missing features.

If I could pay now for pro version I would, but app will not allow until 2 weeks are up.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Great app for sending/receiving texts with emojis from other phone operating systems. Has completely replaced my preloaded Android messaging app. The GIF attachment function is really fun too. There is an issue with sending/receiving MMS if connected to WiFi only. Mobile data is required no matter what the settings (legacy?). The placement and delayed popup of the advert becomes annoying and appears purposely designed to be accidentally clicked (developer replied with a solution - thank you).,5
com.textra,Anna Rose,"This is what I've been searching for! 6 stars! I've avoiding using my new phone due to google now controlling the default txt app. I've tried easy 10 other SMS apps but they're clogged with ads or are really clunky. This is perfect - no ads, seemless and smooth, allows your own keyboard etc and if fully customisable! Not only can you change the colours of the SMS bubble but you can change the icon for each contact (limited to 20 or 30 maybe but that's heaps) individually. It's da bomb yo! hehe",5
com.textra,Blair Malazdrewich,Excited...at first. I really like this app a lot I thought it was great I even upgraded to the pro for five bucks the problem is now every text I get it sends but I get an error message that says it didn't send so I'm getting basically duplicate notifications all the time for no reason. Very annoying and I wish there was a way that you could alter the way the phone vibrates when you get a message in the app.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Love the app enough to pay for the ad-free version. The best feature for me was the ability to pin conversations to the top of the list. I also love the ability to be able to schedule messages. Being able to customize the appearance of both the app & individual conversations is a bonus. By far, the best messaging app I've used to date.",5
com.textra,Mr. Mike,"My Moto G Power default text messaging app started acting weird, it drove me crazy. So I switched to Textra, which is VERY INTELLIGENT. One example: in the Moto G to delete messages, you select them with a tap, including multiple messages, then hit delete. Only problem is, if you tap just a bit the wrong way, you lose all the work you have done (or so I experienced). With Textra, you can select ALL of the messages and then undelete the ones you want to keep (which is what I really wanted).",5
com.textra,M E.C.,"Seriously one if not the best text messaging app for ANDROID. Also one of the few apps I actually went and paid for the full, unlocked version, even though the free version is also excellent. Here are some reasons why this app is fantastic: - HEAVILY CUSTOMIZABLE. Not just the UI, but also the notification light, notification bar, notifications themselves, even vibration for incoming texts and per-contact notification tones. - FULL OF FEATURES. Goes hand in hand with the previous point, but also has features of its own, with a solid search engine, general settings - GREAT UI. Honestly, this point alone makes it the better texting app... It isn't just limited to DARK and LIGHT modes, it is fully customizable in colours, accents, etc - extremely customizable! - EXCELLENT EASE OF USE. Pretty self-explanatory - QUICK WITH FIXES. Generally, a simple email mentioning a glitch, bug or anomaly will be answered within the hour, and a fix delivered nearly in the same time! It isn't uncommon for me to report an anomaly only to receive a fixed .APK with the bug fixed, lightning fast! Honestly, it should basically be the stock android texting app",5
com.textra,Stuart Cross,"Edit: suggested option change works fine. Ta! Latest update 27/4: Free version now has no placeholder for ad at top of screen. When you launch the app, perhaps to tap on latest unread message at top of screen, you may find you tap on the ad if you're not fast enough (because ad only appears after a second or so and makes messages scroll down one notch). Deliberate revenue generating modification or just a glitch? Still looks nice overall but this problem is annoying.",5
com.textra,Cindy Pagano,"Ever since some upgrade, my ""carriage return"" key is missing. The app has worked very well up until that upgrade. I'd like that key back, please. Then I will give Textra 5 stars.",4

com.textra,Ryan K,"I have been using Textra for so many years. I have found no need to switch messaging apps as this app has remained stable and well functioning. Here are many of the features that I find valuable in this app: quick reply box, send delay, emoji organizer, calendar for messages. One suggestion I do have is to include an undo button for a deleted message thread, as well as some way to back up messages and settings. I wish more apps would follow this rather more ethical business model.",4
com.textra,EMS,"Liked it until I realised I couldn't change the swipe options or switch them. They're the opposite to every single other app. I end up calling people instead. No ability to change and I see this was suggested back in 2016. On this basis, I can assume the devs are not remotely open to feedback, it's never likely to get changed so got rid of it. Could have been a decent app. Not to be.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"I found Textra after becoming frustrated with the inability to ""partially copy"" text within the Samsung Galaxy S8 messaging app, and how the S8 app always opens web links in its weak browser. Since then Textra has proven to be functionally solid and reliable. It offers a great range of aesthetic options to make your SMS/MMS appear exactly as you want. There is a comprehensive support forum... the Dev is extremely responsive and immediately assisted with a function I was too dull to work out. You should definitely try this app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Update: I indeed found exactly this advice, as I mentioned, within the threads. It did not work. I cannot stress this enough. Thank you. Have to delete app. Love the customization which is why I installed but after spending 45 minutes trying to get rid of the pop-up feature of the texts (I'm actually technically LITERATE!) I am over it. Apparently this is an issue for this app as there are numerous threads about it online. That is unfortunate.",2
com.textra,Dion Dee,"This is a very well thought out & written app & almost does everything I want it to do. However, as I'm typing a SMS, the font colour randomly changes from white to dark grey - so dark that I can't read what I'm typing (I use a dark theme for my phone). Sometimes it happens at the start but mainly anywhere, there's no pattern. When it happens, if I delete a few letters, it returns to white again but when I type them back in, they turn grey again. Other than that, I would rate this a 5.",4

Then a few years later I changed phones (not the first time) and get a message saying your free ad period has run out. Then ask me if I wanted to go Pro for a fee. I already had Pro, and I refused to pay again. I emailed them and they say that message is standard for trial periods, huh I paid for Pro long time ago! I shouldn't be on no trial. I no longer support Textra.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Love it - I've used the free app for over a year now and won't go back! Custom timed delay on sending texts so you can cancel a text (comes in handy for spelling mistakes), Search function to search for key words in all conversations, Scheduled messages (pick the date, and time for the message to send - great for Birthdays!). Colours are also fully customizable for the app and for each contact (the app icon, app banners, backgrounds, chat bubbles).",5
com.textra,A Google user,"The app itself is great - many people clearly seem to be enjoying it. The problems lie within the stock messaging apps that are built into Android devices, which negatively affect the use of a 3rd party app such as this one. The only workaround is to hack your OS, allowing you to remove these unwanted and problematic stock apps. I think we would all prefer a safer and simpler solution. @dev: I already contacted support - it's up to me to find a solution.",2

Have lost all ability to individualize sms tones and vibration patterns Option is no longer there; in neither the app, itself, nor Google apps and permissions menus. I'm tired of chasing through the forums. I just want it to work like it used to. Still has other functionality, but I really liked the ability to customize stem to stern.... ***UPDATE*** the Textra Team was very helpful and responsive. The problem is solved.",5
com.textra,Evan Eugene,This would be the perfect messaging app if there was an option to customize the background and text bubbles for individual conversations. Guess I'll have to go elsewhere. 'Highly customizable'? Highly debatable. In response to the developer: I would use this app and rate it 5 stars in a heartbeat if not for this one thing.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"Overall the app is very beautiful and performs really well. One issue that prevents me from buying the pro version is that the app doesn't work well with apps that backups or restores messages. When restoring a backup, the conversation is truncated when using Textra. Using the default Android Message however, I can read/restore the whole conversation. Examples of apps used: SMS Backup and Restore, Super Backup",3
com.textra,Manu Nair,"Love this app very much. has all the bells n whistles to raise one's productivity. However having said that, I'm a bit disappointed that there's no web version or a desktop application that my phone can sync the SMSs with, which could have helped me by leaps n bounds. Hope the team realizes this as a good value addition and offers it in the near future.",4

It is user-friendly, nicely customizable, and reliable.

Not world-ending, just wondering what caused this.",5

I like the amount of customisability including changing the colours for each contact which helps to find them easier. Only drawback is if you choose a dark colour for a contact it doesn't automatically change the text colour to a contrasting one so you will struggle to read the messages.

I did so, and they emailed me back saying Textra has never had the function to mark read messages as unread. Tapping the 3 dots on a message opened from the notification preview clearly allows this function. Unimpressed.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"Great SMS app, much better than the stock app on my Samsung. Superbly customisable in every aspect.

I have never had to delete any messages on my phone since performance has never dropped. I love the customisation options and how easy they are to use. Other apps often feel really cluttered and try to jam in every frature possible, but Textra's best feature is how sleek and clean in looks. Exactly what you want your messaging app to feel like.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Very good, clear messaging app with good notifications and delivery reports. The ads that come after the free period are in many cases for online gambling which is awful and you can't delete them.

My only complaint is that, when sending SMS to multiple recipients, it automatically switches to MMS, and it has to be manually changed back to SMS. This was after changing the configuration in the main settings to send messages as SMS to multiple recipients. So pls work on this for a 5 star rating.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Fantastic. I suppose there is one small thing I would change, and that is removing the ""Tell your friends""/""What's new"" options from the immediate menu.

I have not had this issue with either of the phones I have used previously, Samsung 6 and Nokia 8.",2

Present style is clumsy! Otherwise, other things seem to be quite ok! Hope to see these changes incorporated at the earliest, in next update. Thanks!!",4

The only thing I wish it could have is a desktop app, so I can directly send messages from the browser, this is actually the reason why I had to go back to the default Android app, maybe there is some sort of emulator..",5

com.textra,Leopold Ondrasch,"After using Textra for some years now, sadly, I'll be moving to another SMS client. I need to be able to block messages using keywords (blocking numbers isn't sufficient, since the messages I want to avoid come from different numbers every time.) Since Textra doesn't have such a feature, and people have made multiple requests for it for years now, which don't seem to have led to any results, as things stand I feel as though I have no choice but to try a different app. I'll happily return to Textra if keyword blocking is implemented in the future, however, since it's a fantastic app in all other respects.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using Textra since it's inception & find it to be one of the best sms/mms apps in the market. The 9 second delay feature is a must. I no longer have to worry about accidentally sending a half finished txt or send to the wrong person. The only problem I've come across is sometimes searching from within Textra for someone in my address book (Google), they are not found even though i know they are there. i then just have to find them via the phone & use the icon next to their numb.",5
com.textra,Tom Petersen,I love this Textra SMS app. Very easy to use...,5
com.textra,Laurence Munthali,"Excellent app! flexible, amazing UI, smart, easy to use with pleasure and having alot of customs. The group conversation goes beyond my expectations. Quick reply pop-up so wonderful. It has the calendar in conversation screen which will help to allocate SMS s of particular date so easily. The animations and bubbles are just fantastic. I found no problem with it, anything just in place. Am really loving this app like seriously. Keep up the good work, thank you.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"App has always been decent. Great replacement to the standard android messaging up. Recently however it has broken and become incompatible with WearOS, this lost some major functionality for me. Hopefully it's fixed soon. Spoke with support. They are waiting for the release of the newest version of WearOS to make it compatible again. Great team, quick knowledgeable easy answers. Would recommend.",4
com.textra,Raziel Alexander Carranza Delgado,its super good!! But the reason i gave it 3 stars is the mms timeouts cuz mostly everyday i get the time outs and for me as a person who send pictures/videos cuz i like drawing and animating its very annoying not being able to send stuff the whole day or more than a day and also when i do get the chance to send videos its super blurry and the Audio too basically you can't see anything and some of them are 7 or 10 sec long and either i cant send or its EXTREMELY blurry.,3
com.textra,A Google user,Overall good. 1 star less because it doesn't give option to view the blocked spam messages and delete the spam messages. Its just hides them. This is especially irritating when you backup and install a new rom and all the blocked messages are in the inbox again. Plus there is no backup option to restore the blacklisted senders. You have to again blacklist as & when you receive.,4

com.textra,Jamie Jax,Very smooth & has a really good UI which can be customized to your style at ease. Most definitely worth purchasing the pro version to stop ads once trial period ends & doesn't cost much at all. This is most definitely the best messaging app I've come across in all the years. Have never once come across any issues. Highly recommend 5🌟 👌👍,5

It really shines, but feature development seems to have stopped lately.

I'd happily help implement some, or pay more/monthly if that's what it takes :)",5
com.textra,Suhaib Iqbal,"A lot better than my default messenger, I can block the unwanted ad messages, assign different tunes, and colors. Edit: Its not working as it used to. First, the message counter and floating icons do not work anymore so I never know if there is a new message until I actually open the app and check. Moreover, it doesnt send scheduled messages on time now, either early or late, so cant be used as a reminder anymore. Disappointed",3

com.textra,Ryan K,"I have been using Textra for countless years now. I have been very happy with the app to this day. The app is properly designed and free of bloatware which is quite rare to see nowadays. The app includes a vast amount of features including a nice quick reply box, texting send delay and many cool colour customization options. The app comes with a single, very low profile, non intrusive ad, that can be removed with the upgrade. This app has remained stable and well supported for years.",5
com.textra,Sandy,"Love, love ❤️ Textra. Was looking for a messaging app. that allowed me to have a lag before my message was sent & Textra delivered. I have mine set at 5 seconds, which is plenty of time to stop it sending. Also the *schedule* setting is awesome. I get up early & type out a few texts then schedule them for 8, 9, 10 o'clock or even days later. Barely notice the ads. Recommended it to many ppl who also love it. 👍👍",5

However - such important function like - selecting contacts from the phone contacts with creating new message NOT WORKING, AT ALL. Searching not working at all, when I chose ""groups"" card then I had a group of contact (just one, very small), anyway after a while even this contacts disappeared and now it's just not possible to write message to more than one person at once (and I cannot do this starting from ""new message"" screen, just from contacts...). I am looking for something better, for me it's pretty unstable - with my BB Keyone at least.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Dissapointed. Liked the app for the most part prior to upgrading to Pro to get rid of the ads. No feature changes by upgrading but then an update days later wrecked the app. Took away features and it is buggy now. Crashes and when you get a notification while in another app and click on it Textra opens an older unrelated message from another contact. Every time. Too risky to use anymore. Deleted and back to Android Messages. Also Textra lacks the Web Messages feature to use from PC.,2
com.textra,professor underpants,Great. Google messages wouldn't work with my gt2 watch and this would perfectly. I purchased the premium to get rid of ads. The only small issue for me is i would like a setting to turn off the double click for deleting messages. I know its a good idea in case you delete something by accident but i would like the option. Cheers,5
com.textra,Calvin Bochulak,"I just wanted to say thank you to the entire Textra team. This has been my go-to texting app for years. I wouldn't recommend a different one.

Sadly the best feature is gone with android 12. You can no longer set custom vibrations for contacts. Since my phone is almost always on vibrate, I can no longer tell who is messaging me unless I take the phone out to check every time. Still offers great customization!",4
com.textra,Scott Lockhart,"Hi, Just a couple ideas I have for Textra. I've submitted them multiple times through the app, but never got any replies and they have never ended up on the idea list for people to 'like.' Lock Conversations At present, there is the ability to lock individual messages within a conversation, which is great. Can we please also have the option to lock individual conversations so they can't be accidentally deleted? When a conversation is locked, there could also be a little padlock icon, similar to the 'pin' icon when conversations are pinned to the top of the conversation list. Folder Options The ability to create folders in the main conversation list (eg. appointments, work, family, etc.). With the ability to add conversations to created folders. This way the main conversation list wouldn't be clogged with heaps of messages and would give a way for people to organise and archive conversations. Regards, Scott",4
com.textra,Rodney Howard,"I've been using Textra for a few years now, and one of the best features is sending bulk SMS to different groups that are set up in Google Contacts. This has been working great on all of my Samsung phones, but ever since I got a new Oppo phone it keeps coming up with a message asking me ""Textra is sending a large number of SMS messages. Do you want to allow this app to continue sending messages?"", and it doesn't give me any option to hit ok or cancel. This has rendered the app useless to me.",3
com.textra,A Google user,I started using this App again. I sent several group messages. The ff day I found out there were at least 4 messages that I missed receiving! Senders told me they replied right away. This is a major foul-up! Those are work-related messages. Bad for business. No way am I going back to this App. And to think I bought the Premium version.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"Bought the pro a few years ago, but moved on due to no archive feature, still as we approach 2019 there still isn't an option to archive messages, I don't understand why this is so difficult, or why the reluctance to add it especially since many people have requested this feature. I'll check again next year! Just checked the Textra uservoice page, and a request for archiving has hit 7007 votes, but no word from the team.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"It would be great if you add backup to google drive feature and restore to Textra back feature. Nothing could have stopped no one giving it 5 star rating.

Thanks for your great work. Salute. Edit: One thing I have forgotten is please add ""Select All"" threads option. Thanks.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"After buying my 1st Android phone, I opened the stock messaging app and tried to change the conversation colours...which led to discovering Textra. Two and a half years later, I'd leave more than five stars if it were possible. Textra is the Burger King of app interface customization - you can have it your way. Search, scheduled messages, the style of emojis you prefer...it even works great in Samsung DeX! Textra is an essential addition to any phone. Texting just isn't the same without it.",5

Frequently when replying to a txt, nothing I input on the keyboard registers with the app. Real pain in the ass. I took months troubleshooting. Removed the draw on other apps permission from EVERY other app on my phone. Still did not fix the problem. Otherwise I like the app, just too frustraed to keep using it.",2
com.textra,jessanie lumagbas,"I love this app. It's feature packed. Everything I needed from a messaging app. Except that it doesn't have an 'archive' option. It'll be perfect if you add an archive option. There are those people who like clean main inbox so old messages archived instead of deleting them. I have had pro/ad free version for several months now. Add an archive option please,that'll make it even better.",4
com.textra,H H,"I downloaded this because Class 0 messages are able to be shown on top of the current app I'm using, and this is important when I need to get One Time Pin message to top up my ewallet balance (Messages by Google just goes to another screen, causing the whole process to be reset, so I can never top up).

What a crock and thankfully textra offers it. Draw back to Textra is no ability to automatically have messages older than a certain age to be automatically deleted. Had to delete all my messages to get rid of years of messages that were taking up gigs of space. Need a feature to delete messages like 6 months old unless they are flagged not to be deleted. Bigger problem that just started happening is for textra not to show new messages on my app icon. They come in and you no longer see a number count of newly received messages. Tried clearing cache and turning on and off my notifications for textra on mt phone setting but no luck. Seems to be a random issue that doesn't always happen. Very frustrating.",3

It annoys me that I can have a thread with date, time & location for a social event which I keep. I then want to message the same person on a totally unrelatef subject. With the default & Textra apps, starting a new text automatically starts with the other thread which may be several bubbles long. This is so annoying.",4

I am open to pay for the pro version but there does not seem to be any place in the app that outlines the differences of the pro version from the free version other than the removal of ads. ads arent too bad as is so i might not upgrade yet",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Have been using it for a very long time. The only issues I have are: - Inconvenient UI for setting up a custom vibration; - No way to read blocked sms if you want to. Would like to have some folder. like spam in email, which you can occasionally check, but which not seen in main screen. Update: Unblacklist the number to check blocked messages? No thanks, too cumbersome to unblacklist, read and then again block it back and forth. Don't want to bother like this just to read spam occasionally.",4
com.textra,George Barbanis,"Great app! Its dark themes are a blessing for my weak eyes! After moving to new phone. Lock screen notifications and sound did not work, and color selection for bubble customization oly allowed selection of a few colors. But app support answered immediately - definitely worth 5 stars just for that! See their answer below if you too face these problems.",5
com.textra,Scott W,LOVE Textra! BEST messaging app out there IMHO.,5
com.textra,White Rabbit,"Been using for quite a while, worth the small cost to remove ads. Well supported and actively improved. One feature I would like is to backup texts to the phone rather than using other apps to do it - but I don't do this often anyway so it really doesn't matter much.",5
com.textra,Joseph Brewer,Great app for texting. But it needs Google's RCS chat,4
com.textra,Jon Hoard,"I love Textra and have for many years. I just received a new Galaxy S22 and updated to Android 13. I am having a problem where if I try to share a picture or graphic and then add text to, the graphic is replaced with an exclamation point. (!) If I send the graphic by itself it goes OK. In the What's new you show a version 5.6 but the latest on Google play is 5.5 which I have. Was the problem I'm having with the graphic being deleted fixed in 5.6 or do I have another problem or setting.",5
com.textra,Teague Wilson,"I like and use this app, but it's not even as good as default app for sending small video files, so I sometimes have to switch back and forth as anything over 12s will generally fail to send (also true for >1 picture at a time)",4
com.textra,nyc 2255,"I have been a Pro user for many years, and it's the customization I like about this app. And tech support is very fast. Recently had an issue and Max and Jason were quick to diagnose and resolve. Thanks guys. Keep bringing the upgraded features please! Good stuff. 👋",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Switched from google messages after they removed customizable contact and conversation colors. Although the basic version has ads, they are not very noticeable. The app has per contact customization, including: icon and conversation color, notification sound, notification icon, send delay length, and a few others. Great app. Would recommend.",5
com.textra,matt krueger,Can we get a update to be able to change the background picture color I'm a pro user and have asked this before it would be perfect if you guys could do that 😁,5

com.textra,A Google user,"I downloaded this app to use it for scheduled text messages. As luck (or stupidity) would have it, I didn't need to send a scheduled text until after I bought the premium version. Well, it doesn't work. Maybe because I'm using a Huawei Mate 20 Pro... I don't know, but the scheduled texts don't get sent on time. As instructed by the Textra guys, I deleted the app and re-downloaded it. No change. I fiddled about with the settings so that this app would never sleep, still no change. I wasted my $$$",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Needed to use an app that would allow more pictures to be sent than the stock messaging app. Also, after a system update the stock app stopped allowing individual messages within a conversation to be selected and would not copy messages as a whole, for purposes like emailing. This app does it all. Great themes and other customization features as well",5
com.textra,Daniel Otto,"great app, superior to my standard Android messenging app in just about every way. highly recommended",5
com.textra,Christopher Wangemann,I've been using this app for years but ever since I've updated to the latest Android version it keeps crashing my keyboard until force stop Textra. Sometimes the so itself crashes or doesn't receive a text. My phone will just vibrate but it won't show up. I'm on the Google Pixel 4a5g. Please fix these bugs because your app is the best and is always the first thing I download on all my new phones!,3
com.textra,A Google user,Correctly downsizes sizes photos so that MMS works (Aldi has a 2MB MMS limit). My default Android 9 SMS/MMS app didn't do this (Android 8 SMS app did). Has too many ads in the free version so it is worth paying for the ad free version (a few dollars). It's being actively developed... with a rapid succession of upgrades which have eliminated crashing problems... and added a lot of improvements. Creating SMS groups is still not as easy as it ought to be though. Any problems are now either settings issues or more commonly network issues. Much better than the standard SMS app on my Unihertz Atom. I'm very happy with it. :-),5
com.textra,A Google user,"Very good app. Highlights: 1) Able to copy partial text from messages Please allow blacklisting of phrases in messages. Spammers are very creative nowadays, and simply blacklisting won't work, because they never use the same phone number twice (in Indonesia). They use some online spamming service. Without this feature, people who get spamm3d a lot like me are forced to use a different app.",4
com.textra,Selam G B,The app don't have backup and restore please fix it,4
com.textra,Christian Nielsen,This app is customizable and the most usable sms app I've found for Android. Needs 2 things to be a perfect 5 star app. 1) a web interface like the one from Android Messages 2) RCS support (please Google release an API). I struggle with the decision to continue using Textra or switch back to messages because it's missing these critical features even though messages is just the latest in Google's half-assed attempts at sms and instant messaging.,4
com.textra,Sola Adeniran,"Good App I must confess! I needed to change from the pre-installed google messenger, which is dull and lacks customization/personalization features. I downloaded Textra SMS app today, and it appears to be on point. But as rich as it is, it has no room for message counter, and I can't find anywhere to customize the chat/conversation wallpaper, nor the screen/home wallpaper. Pls, show me if there's, and if there's not, add. Thanks.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Im using this app almost a year and I loved it but everything changes when its start to pop some ads. Recently i accidentally click some ads all over again then after that even i use other apps, ads keep popping. I hate when something disturbing me while playing. Please fix this! I uninstall this app because of that matter. I want to re-install it again but i doubt it that it could happen again or worst.",2
com.textra,Simon Worth,"I had to edit my review because ""love it"" just doesn't cut it anymore. I've been rocking TEXTRA since my pixel 2. I can't ever go back to the stock texting client, and that's not just because I paid for premium textra. It's just the best app out there with all its features and continuously updating.",5
com.textra,Addison Ivy Park,"It's a really nice interface, the ads are a little bothersome but they're few and far in between and they're only headers, not full screen ads which I can appreciate. I like being able to customize the colours n stuff it's a pretty great app and I'll continue using it.",4
com.textra,A. C. Amade,An excellent apps without the shadow of the doubt. Thumbs up 👍🏽,5
com.textra,Joey Anderson,"Been using Textra for awhile and really like it, it's fast, with lots of customizations. Unfortunetely the update has caused a loss in MMS notifications when data is turned off. Before if data was off, I would get a drop-down notification saying something like ""MMS Failed to Download"". This would inform me to turn on my data, and the MMS message would download. Now that doesn't happen. Still my favourite texting app for speed and appearance.",4
com.textra,David Stoodley,Cannot receive SMS or MMS with this app or others. Would appreciate any help you can offer thanks.,2
com.textra,A Google user,Great little app. Has a specific feature which I needed that's not available on the pre-installed messaging app on the Pixel 3. Also love the fact that i can send gifs straight from the app. Great delay sending feature which is good for stopping a message being sent with auto-correct mistakes lol. Perfect app for my needs.,5
com.textra,K Ww,"I'm happy to say that I am completely surprised at how good this app is. My budget phone has terrible stock messaging. Not only is this app operating perfectly, I'm not flooded with adds, and the customization options are rad AF! I've actually found myself playing around with the colors, and bubble's, and everything. I highly recommend this app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I am a Pro user and this used to be my favourite SMS app. But it no longer supports integration with Google Assistant or Android Auto for audio notification of incoming message or hands-free reading of messages. Google Messages and Samsung Messages still work fine, however. EDIT: Thanks to Textra staff for reaching out - after describing my issue in numerous emails, I would love to hear back from you about any solutions you can offer. I sent tons of info and feedback and then... crickets.",2
com.textra,Julie L.,Best SMS app I've used. Used for years now. Had some glitches after a factory reset 4 days ago. No notification of texts from yesterday. Preinstalled messaging app works okay.

All fixed now. 🙄😊,5
com.textra,blanket cetera,"Definitely like this app. I've been using different sms app ever since but I stayed in Textra. Wanted to give 5 stars but please fix this issue first, not all of my contact display their picture even tho they have photo in my contact list. Only some display their picture, please fix. It's really frustrating and I don't want to switch again to another sms app. Advance thank you for your immediate response.",4

com.textra,Robert Teuma-Castelletti,The fact that Textra sends those reaction messages in the same annoying format as iMessage is amazing. I love sending those annoying messages and explaining to iPhone users that that is what I used to see when they would react. Turn about is fair play!,5

Only minor annoyance, and frustration, is not having an immediate upgrade to PRO, option, which would come in handy when setting up phones for family and friends - make the 14 days grace period optional.

com.textra,Nick Rose,"Great App so far but an Issue I have noticed recently is when I switch from power saving mode the textra app is in max zoom. I need to adjust the app settings and put the font size to the minimum setting just to make it regular size. When I switch back to the optimized phone setting, the font is at the minimum setting making it almost unreadable and have to change it back. Not sure why it does that, and is annoying to constantly change the font size every time my battery saving mode is changed",4

com.textra,Amadeus Kael W. Pyralis,"Great app, good price with a bevy of features above the stock Messages apps I've encountered. However, the most recent update has made it so nearly every message doesn't send through, requiring me at times to have to retry sending three sometimes even five times before it goes through. An update to patch this real soon would be appreciated. Update: Developer reached out to help, even though they stated it was a carrier issue. The developer didn't respond to me after that, but after some investigating and troubleshooting I would agree the carrier is the issue. Five stars since the app itself is wonderful and offers FAR more than any stock app and the price is right on point.",5

It has come to my attention however, that there are some messages that I DO NOT recieve/ are NOT sent. This has proved to be a serious issue in my communicating with business partners and personal contacts. The problem with this is that you will never know which messages you did not receive, thus most contacts will believe you have disregared their message.",2
com.textra,Stief Adventure,"While the parent of our devices has added a lot of the functions & custom items to their SMS/MMS app.. This one is still better & easily worth the buy in!

Get this, take a few minutes to make it yours and ""change my mind""!! 6 Stars",5

I just like changing things up...in hopes of finding my ideal...whatever. the only complaint I have with this app is.... There's no details option, for the message you've sent/rcvd. Like, the detail showing you to whom, when, time, how it went and if it was rcvd/read. I have found that that option I use alot, due to phone issues. Unless there IS a detail button??

I am impressed by their speed and attentiveness. If I could give them 6 out of 5 stars I would. Thank you guys!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Excellent texting app however in the most recent update it removed the option of opening the conversation in the full app from clicking the notification. Not sure if this is a bug or something they changed but I'd really like the option to go back to how it was before, having to go scroll to the conversation that the notification was from is getting a tad annoying instead of just clicking the notification and having it take me directly to that conversation in the app.",4

com.textra,RipstikGirl95,It seems like some messages do not go through to Textra if you recently switched and are texting with other androids that are using the default app. There's some layout things that aren't ideal like the way it shows as a partial screen with a smaller keyboard if replying quickly to a message that showed up while in other apps. The notification options in the app's settings are nice options but don't really work the way they should- notify 2 times for unread messages is more like 4 notifications,4

com.textra,A Google user,"The settings make the app quite customizable and easy to use. But compared to apps like kakao or line, there is a lack of themes. You can't change the backgrounds and text bubbles the same way other apps let you. Other than that, I am very satisfied. Also, the ios emojis are excellent (which is why I haven't uninstalled).",4
com.textra,A Google user,Love this app. A guy I used to work with told me about it. I downloaded it and immediately bought the pro version. Only wish you could still have multicolored notification LEDs that was handy when someone texted. Didn't have to touch the phone to see who it was just looked at the LED flashing. Oh well maybe once again they will allow it.,5
com.textra,A Google user,I like Textra. The option to ensure my picture files are compressed to within the carrier limit is great. I like the ability to set per sender colours. I'd give this 5 stars if it would let me create a draft message without specifying the recipient until I want to send - a small protection against accidentally hitting the send button while I'm still editing the text. Upgraded to 5 star... with delayed send on I am protected against accidental send but can send immediately with a double press👍,5
com.textra,Yolanda W,"Can't say enough good things about this app extension, works so well and I love the customisation, great if like me you want a specific theme running throughout your phone. Highly recommend. Loads of extra options that you don't get with built in sms such as chat colours and tailored notifications. Only thing is it comes with ad banners, but they're barely noticeable.",5

Have implemented robust filtering features awhile ago. This is the one thing this app needs more than anything else. The old basic 'mark as Spam' doesn't cut it anymore, not when scammers are blasting thousands of phones at once using email addresses and constant spoofing. At some point I'll have to switch just for filters.",5

Allow us to search individual conversations, I don't want to search every single conversation I have. Also. Allow us to set a default theme for everyone, including bubble color and let it follow new chats. I know you can long hold and do a mass change but you shouldn't have to if you've already set the theme. It would also be nice to adjust the spacing of conversations.",2

You'll love the unique, intuitive fluidic interface. Must try it.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Love it!. I've been using Textra for years now.

Well done to the development team.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"There are few suggestions, add block option from the notification area similar to Read, Delete, Call, etc. This will help to block all the spam messages which we receive quite often. I would also suggest another feature to be added, if there would be a server sync that would be great, this needs to sync all the massages to the linked mobile number and also the blocked messages, settings, etc. Even if we install Textra SMS on a new device, this should sync and populate all the messages, settings, blocked messages, etc to the new device.",4
com.textra,Jack W,"Need to change my rating unfortunately. App was great for many years, but feels like no new features have been added. Can't schedule send, no spam filter, can't use RCS. It's 2022. This app feels like 2017 EDIT: Okay since you can schedule send, I will add in a different feature that many other messaging apps have but textra doesn't. There is no way to archive conversations. Only option to hide a conversation from your the main page is to delete it",3

I switched apps on account of the default andriod messaging app on my Blackberry Keyone playing up and missing vital messages that appeared weeks later. Switching was seamless.

No default setting for which sim card to send messages from and so I inadvertently sent some from my Pay As You Go second sim and was charged.

com.textra,Stephen Kaplan,"I've always really loved Textra and the customization options it provides to make texting more fun. I just wish it would incorporate the new RCS messaging that Google has added to compete with iMessage to provide read receipts and see when the other person is typing.

com.textra,A Google user,"I have used this app for years and upgraded to the Pro version. I just got a new phone, Samsung S10e and transferred everything to it. The stock messaging app has all my texts, including all old ones. When I installed Textra and made it the default messaging app, it doesn't sync any of my past conversations, Only new ones. What am I missing?",5
com.textra,Thain Dikkers,"Before using Textra I tried other texting apps but was never satisfied with formats or other features. Textra is just for text messages from the phone number and does not mix text messages with Facebook messages, instance gram etc.. That's is my favorite feature. Would like the time stamp as suggested in another posted review. Thanks for a super app!",5
com.textra,J C,"I have used Textra Pro with my first Pixel and now Pixel 3. In recent months there has been a delay when sending MMS (3 dots while waiting), recipients receiving text doubles or not at all, and this week, random text threads suddenly went missing (eventhough they were present when I switched to Google Messages). Overall Textra has been quite stable with the increase in updates. Now I've uninstalled and uploaded again. Hopefully this works",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Love it. It's simple to use, free, and you're able to set individual text tones, colors, etc for every contact which is really big for me. Always recommending this app, even with the few bugs it has, I over look them for how well it is in general.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I was prompted to get Textra when my sister complained about me pocket dialing her, yet again. The pre installed message app on my S9 has the call button at the top of the screen so I would call someone at least once a day by mistake when I was in their messaging screen. I think I have made one pocket dial with a month of Textra! I paid the minimal price to upgrade after the trial. My sanity is worth it! I only wish you could customize the background with your own photos or wallpapers.",5
com.textra,Matthew Herriage,Best Android SMS app I've come across. Too bad there are ads if you don't upgrade. Still five stars.,5
com.textra,Daniel Robbins,There's a bug in the app that's preventing me from unmuting a group conversation,3
com.textra,A Google user,I love this app. Have been using it for a few years now and won't use any other. I don't normally pay for apps but at such a small cost I bought the pro version and glad I did to support the hard work the developers do to improve the app all the time. I love how much customisation is available with colours and bubbles and being able to have different themes for different people. Also the fact you can send multiple pictures and have group messages without any issues. I highly recommend this app👍,5
com.textra,Lori L. Clark,Please put back the option to click on phone numbers received in messages so I can call them. AND I DID EMAIL YOU ALREADY!!! Your fix did not work.,1

com.textra,A Google user,"***Edit: Dev response worked. Redownloaded and happy as can be! 5/5*** I enjoy the customization of the app. However if you clear the notification at the top of the screen (android) it removes the message indicator on the app icon, AS WELL as inside the app. This has caused me to not respond to many messages as I clear my notification bar religiously. Unless there is a setting I can change, I had to stop using it. Otherwise I really did prefer the app to my default messaging",5
com.textra,Mark Bochkov,Among other to rated apps I'll stick to this one. Changing the UI scale is a killer feature. However I wish I had an option to disable those emojis. The faces are very irritating: I want to see the text in the text messenger. There is the Simpsons for yellow heads. Update: there are ads. Uninstalled,3
com.textra,Chuck Berlinger Jr.,This is a great app. it would be nice to see some new features like being able to like people comments or posts in text chats. Well worth the download!,4
com.textra,Kelley Doyle,"The things I love... My carrier only allows 10 people in a sms conversation, but Textra allow multiple. I can create a group in my contacts and Textra allows me to send a new message to that group without having to add each person individually.  I start my day at 5AM but not everyone is up that early. I love that I can schedule text messages for a later date.  The only things that would make it perfect is spam controls and new messages being bold. Thanks again for the awesome app!",4
com.textra,Filbert Ndunguru,A great Application!. Easy and satisfying to use! I strongly recommend it without any doubt. You'll never regret wasting your moment downloading it!,5

BUT.... it upgraded last night and the Textra Bot keeps cropping up every five minutes, and there is no notification sound! I paid for this so I expect it to work. It was perfectly fine before update!!! 😫",5
com.textra,Kate Kahl,I'm uninstalling. It is frustrating that it will unmark texts as read for no reason. All of a sudden you will have 4 or more texts unread in a thread you are actively responding in. You also cannot send video even if very short. I do wish it had a link to call the contact. That is me nit picking.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"This is a wonderful SMS App. I love the look and ease of customization. I have tried many other messaging apps but this one is very visually appealing and not too blotted with millions of options that you probably never use. My only compliant is that i don't always get the notification badges to show on the icon for unread messages, but i do get the drop-down card indicating that I have an unread message. im still debating if i should purchase the AD free version. Still deciding..",4
com.textra,Glenn Leach,"Best text message handler, most features!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I have been using textra since just before Christmas and I like it, it's super fast in sending messages out where as the one that came with the phone was very slow and didn't always send or receive. I can certainly recommend this app, good job everyone at textra. cheers! sorry had to edit after posting.",5
com.textra,Boboy Sumulong,Messages simply won't send. Seems this has been a long-time issue that has not been resolved. Some say it's an Android problem. Switching the phone on and off or toggling airplane mode doesn't do anything. And to think I paid for the pro version. Frustrating really.,1
com.textra,Robert Dylina,Edit:Unfortunately I am downgrading my review after years of using Textra. Feels like theyve just given up. Promised features never get developed and even the stock messaging apps on my new samsung have super feature sets to textra now. Sadly it appears it is no longer going to be my texting app. Old review:Searching individual conversations. Want to go find that text from Marty about Thanksgiving? Sorry. You have to search EVERY conversation as a whole.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"This app is great for messaging. The use of a calendar selection function is great. You can jump through time without having to scroll through a long history of messages. The only feature that I miss having in another app is the use of WEB messages, where you can sync the app with a browser and write messages from there.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Best app for SMS. Seriously: I can send bulk SMS, I can program when they go, see when they were sent and received. I've set mine so it has a 3 second delay in sending, which is so useful. It's 100% reliable. It really is the best SMS/MMS app I've come across.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've used multiple messaging apps to narrow down which one performed the best and gave the best experience. This is hands down Textra. Not only is customization a huge positive for this app. Also the feature like quick reply is executed far better and less intrusively on this app than others like chomp that take up your whole screen when you get a notification. You get everything in the app for free, and can get rid of ads for $4 and help for future improvements. This is the best messaging app!",5
com.textra,Mitchell Bakarich,"Used it for several years, and is better than any other messaging app I've used. The dev actually releases a changelog with their updates which are actually very concise and always appreciated! The scheduled text is a feature I use more than I thought I would. Great customization but extremely user friendly. Strongly worth the couple bucks it was at the time I got it.",5
com.textra,Matt,"Would be great if they supported better spam filtering, email spam messages, extra long call codes, group messages from long lists of unknown numbers etc",2
com.textra,A Google user,Amazing app! There are so many ways to customize individual contacts its crazy. Exactly what i wanted. I went through several apps trying to just get individual customized msg alerts when i found this one. The only con (if you call it that) is that there are some customizations that i dont know what they do. Great job!,5
com.textra,Bill Ordaz-Garcia,"Love the app, but it could definitely use customizable swipe options. For missing one of the main features nearly every other custom messaging app has, I can't give it 5 stars. I'm quite surprised there's been nothing done about it even though it's been brought up several times.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I actually love this app. There are ads that pop up from time to time but not a problem area. The texting sounds are amazing and the predictive text is ... well, I love that too. Just give them a try, if you do not like it, delete it. I've been using textra for about 3 months now and I would definitely recommend this to my friends!!!",5
com.textra,Laura Lowery,"Would love this app, but for some reason whenever I put the app on my homescreen, it disappears within the hour. As soon as I pick up my phone to text someone the icon is gone. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And its the ONLY ONE THAT DISAPPEARS. I do not have this issue with any other apps, ever. And it has happened since I had this app, about two months or more. Kept wishing that one day it would just stay on my home screen, but it did not. So therefore it isn't even worth using.",1
com.textra,Pale Thomas,"Textra has proven to be EVERYTHING I have ever expected from an SMS/MMS app. I've had others that were OK, but there was always some missing feature or glitch that made it not quite ideal. So far (four months?), I have found nothing but perfect use and operation. Keep up the great work !",5
com.textra,Jacob Christopher Enriquez,I love how easy it is to use the app. I've been using it since 2013 or 2014 and I paid premium around 2015. I discovered it will now sync my texts from my old device to the new one (except for Images). Only thing is it wont allow me to send a video to another person. But overall an excellent app for me.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I used the free trial version and just updated to the Pro version. The ads in the free version were not an issue for me at all, I just felt this app was of good quality to me so I have no problems supporting the developer financially when I can. Great work on this app!!!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I don't usually leave reviews but this app deserves one imho. I absolutely love using it! I wanted an app that I could send gifs with and Textra not only sends them but allows you to look them up within the app for the person you are about to send it to. It is fast and reliable as well. Well worth at least trying if you are looking for a new messaging app!,5
com.textra,Joel Simbulan,no errors. just ads,5
com.textra,A Google user,"So as an iPhone user switching to the Galaxy s10+ I heard that I found that this app fixed my imessage issues very well. With the stock messaging app, my pictures to iPhone users were not sending and I was not receiving photos sent to me via iPhone. Textra cured that! Now my fiance can send me cute pictures of our cats once again while he works from home and I'm at the office! The app is basically flawless as well - I've only had to force restart one time. 😊",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been a Textra user for over 5 years now, and I have never looked back. The best messaging app I've seen. The only issue I've ever had is when factory resetting my phone, my group chats had to be reset in order to receive messages properly. But, I'm willing to blame that on the retrieval app I used. In any case, thank you, Delicious, for making a supreme app.",5

I'm very happy the problem was resolved by using Textra! One problem fixed, another problem shows up. Textra constantly sends me texts that are three or four days old......especially ones that contain a photo. I received two such texts this morning. It would be great if there was a way to resolve this problem, but not annoying enough to stop using Textra.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"To get more than one star, any app must do one thing without fail: not lose messages. Granted, my setup is strange: dual SIM, main line in first slot, and two cards alternate in the second slot: 1) unlimited data, or 2) cheap international. I only receive SMS to my main line. I have failed to receive bank sms and several critical personal sms. I am left with the unease of not knowing what else i lost. The fix was reverting to the factory app.",1
com.textra,Jason Biwer,This has been one of the best texting apps I've ever used. Still using it years later and with every phone I get.,5
com.textra,A Google user,What's going on. Textra is deleting entire message chains from people randomly. Even if every other feature is really good it's a bug fail if it doesn't keep your messages Edit > admins contacted me very swiftly and very quickly fixed up my problem. All sorted. App works great. Definitely worth the purchase,5
com.textra,Andrew,"Default messaging app was bugging for me so I turned to textra. Has nearly everything the old one had that i used plus more customization. The ONLY thing its missing is read receipts. I can see when a message is delivered, but I cant see when someones READ my message. Other than that, its everything the average person would need.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using this app for over 2 years and I can say that it's my favorite alternative to the stock messaging. There are so many more options to customize your messages, including timing a text to send (which is one of my favorite things to do as I forget to remind people about things or things I have coming up). I rarely write reviews for apps but I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone.",5
com.textra,M. G.,"Google messages shows me if I have a message that didn't download. Textra: no way of knowing that I may have missed something. ### My issue is not about the network / RCS failure, you cannot fix that. My issue is that your app doesn't notify me when there is a missing message. If I knew, I could reach out and try to get the info. But, without a notification I'm in the dark. Ignorance is not bliss.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"I've used this app since I have had a Google pixel and I do really like the customization options and it's very fast and sleek. I don't know if this is my end but some times I text an iPhone user they don't receive my text, or vice versa. My partner and mother wonder why I don't respond and then I wonder why they don't respond which can be annoying. But other than that the app is great!",4
com.textra,Derek Gold,Use to be free. Button to pay inside app doesn't do anything or work. Stuck with ad at the bottom that doesn't go away. Disappointing update that turned free into ads with pay that doesn't work. If it wasn't a great app I would give 2 star. Suggest to only make an app paid if you have it definitely working. And give features more than it was already working plain. Just a downgrade. Both button and settings area to pay doesn't open anything to pay.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"An extra ordinary app. Few suggestions, can we have an option to reduce the gap between two contacts in conversation list. Another, after latest update, the messages recieved now covers more width of screen which is a good. However the sent messages are still have old width. I think it is a bug and sent messages should be allowed to have wider space.",5
com.textra,Sonja Eckert,"I like being able to color code and change the subtle appearance of messages. It does throw in an AD after a small trial period, but you have the ability to move it. Still considering purchasing the pro pack because it's a smooth app, no issues with it.",4

com.textra,A Google user,Been usig it for a few years now and it does nearly everything i want it to. Biggest annoyance is the inconsistent functionality of the talk-to-text which sometimes refuses to dictate anything after multiple attempts at running the microphone. It shows that it's listening but writes nothing.,3
com.textra,A Google user,It's an amazing App overall with all the basic feature beautifully designed. The only problem is that the inline notification drawer reply or the online heads up notification reply doesn't work sometimes and it seems like the message was sent but it actually wasn't! I hope you look into this ASAP.,3
com.textra,trent Washington,I use it by default. samsung got rid of the ability to lock and save certain texts.,4
com.textra,A Google user,Update to my last review. I upgraded Textra to 3 stars from 2. After a few uninstalls and reinstalls of the app it now works to pre-schedule a text send. Now the issue is that Textra seems to require a minimum of 3 bars of signal strength or my texts are randomly not sent. When this happens Textra need to incorporate an icon badge within the messages list so I dont have to search for what messages failed to send. My stock Android app sends texts with 2 bars of strength fron the same location.,3

I really liked the ""Textra heads-up notification"" style instead of the bland android heads up style. please help.",4
com.textra,ann vitz,I loved this app until the last update. For some reason any links sent in a text I can no longer open. I saw in a FAQ section in their app that this is a known issue and the solution is to Uninstall the current version and go back to an older version. I'll lose all current conversations. This doesn't seem like a good solution 😕,3

I've been using this app for a while, a few years, and I love the different features you can get as a Pro User, and I love that you can change the colors and there's so many options for various styles and settings.

com.textra,Holley Hughes,I love this app so much! I bought the paid version quite a while back primarily because of the customization options. It also just looks way more clean and clear when compared to other texting apps. Recently I had a bug occur and had to switch back to my phone's default text app which made me REALLY appreciate the clean & simple layout of textra. I also got a very quick response from the team about my problem and now it's fixed! Easily one of the best app purchases I have ever made.,5
com.textra,M. White,posted a review got a reply and then it was removed... Switched to Textra when I had issues receiving pics in the stock app. What I miss the most is the ability to archive messages. I don't want some threads deleted but don't need them clogging up my display either. Also every time I update I have to drag it back to my screen and it's the only app that does this.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app. Have used it since its intro. However, I've now got a deal-breaker. Early Sept I stopped receiving SMS/MMS messages. Clearing the cache w/a FC seems to work temporarily, but soon after it starts dropping all messages. I reverted back to the native messaging app and it works as designed. Handcent and Aurora work normally, too. Thus, it must be isolated to Textra. Using Aurora until this is fixed. -OnePlus 6T with latest Android patches, on Google Fi",1

This has been the best texting app that I've used since getting my new phone. The customization features are crazy good.

Even then, this app is still leagues better than your phone's default texting app has to offer. I won't be looking to change any time soon.",5

com.textra,A Google user,Been using app for years now. The customization is my favorite part. The fact you can set a delay in your text being sent is a very useful tool in case you need to cancel and edit it. I also like the fact they keep updating which means they take the consumer/product serious with fixes and improvements.,5
com.textra,Matthew Harris,"Just a thought but when I mute a contact, don't have future texts from them hit notifications. I muted an annoying bot because it has a habit of double texting for every event and despite being muted, when the second text came in, there it is in my notification bar and making my notification LED flash. I had to block it to make it stop notifying me. Had muting it just ignored texts from that point on, I wouldn't have had to block it altogether which would have been preferable since now the text string is gone completely.",3

Then it will be a 5 star app. (By the way still its a great app)",4
com.textra,Bill Rebey,It's a quality app that is reliable and works as expected. If I was looking for another feature it would be to search a text stream for a word . It seems that right now the search feature is across every single text conversation in its history. I've never wanted to search every conversation I've ever had for a certain word. I frequently however wish that I could search the specific conversation for a certain word or phrase.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love this app but I am going to uninstall it for now because it's not what I was searching for. I am searching for an app which allows you to set background photos & customize your own color theme. This app only allows you to select a color theme & not set background photos. I will see if I can find an app that does both but if I do not find one, I will reinstall this app. I like it because it reminds me of my old HTC windows phone the way it operates. It's smooth.🙂 Thanks for reply! Okay!👍",5

Kindly see to this also. Thanks a lot",5
com.textra,A Google user,It just works. I love having different signatures that I can choose to use or not use for each message I send. I use a formal signature as well as informsl or even none at all. The customiseable speech bubbles & theme colours are a bonus. The app is being actively maintained unlike so many others. I've used Textra for over 4 months now and have found it reliable and bug free. All this deserves 5* review.,5

com.textra,Juan Flores,"Awesome App. My unlocked phone didn't have a stock messaging app, only Google messages, and this is a much better alternative with certainly more features.

com.textra,A Google user,"Not terrible, could be better. Can't set ""favorite"" contacts so have to scroll through entire contact list every time I start a group chat. Also, not receiving messages consistently when on a plane. (yes, WiFi calling is enabled) Otherwise decent app with some fun/useful features.",3
com.textra,M As,"Really enjoyed customization. Don't appreciate having to pay to keep app. The ads are frustrating. Google messages seem indefinitely broken, so might need to change. But honestly need to think about. Mobile phone bill is so high and yet I can't texting without having to pay more.",2
com.textra,Leo JK,"When it's desktop version is coming? It is the only thing missing otherwise a perfect messaging app for me. I do not want to use Google messages app and on the web. I have tried pushbullet, mysms, mightytext but nothing is suitable for me. Overall this app is perfect I just want it's web based interface without qr code scanning but instead synching via email account. Please let us know if web interface is something you guys are working on.",5
com.textra,Treasure Chest,"Textra is the greatest out there. Completely customizable, they don't bug you about upgrading all the time, and super reliable. I have been using it for years and have never had a problem with texting, either on my personal phone or my business phone. Thanks Textra!",5
com.textra,Arkenbrien,"I really wanted to continue using this app past the ad free period. Nice dark mode, customizable, etc. However, once the ad free time was up, instead of placing an ad banner at the bottom, it was disguised as your most recent text message. I'm really dissapointed in this decision, it is predatory and deceptive. I'm not going to pay money (5 bucks) to devs who think this is a good thing, I simply don't think they are deserving. Edit: ads placed at bottom take 3, 4 slots. Why.",1
com.textra,Saket Shah,"I've using this for last at least 3 years. great text app. Pro user. I love the features and easy to use. But recently started having issues with Samsung s20. As I'm starting to send a text, the key board disappears/flickers 4-5 times before I can type. Super annoying.",4

I have now got my sweetheart, both kids, brother, sister cousins and a few neighbors switched to Textra, seriously. I am a retired geek who everybody comes to for advice & help.so when I spread the word, about something that I recommend and highly approve of, it usually results in a change. Hey it's a little bit of a hassle but the huge upgrade in functionality, customization and ease of use is worth it. Good job guys!",5

Philosophically opposed to living in the Apple biosphere, but even the best Android texting apps fall somewhat short of iMessage... ergo, 4 stars. But seemingly, Textra is the best of the Android litter.",4

In settings it says I should be getting app badge notifications. Wow developer response was cute. Unkind? How about unprofessional?

I'm sure they are up front about this, but in case you missed it like I did, just know. I got the premium, though, and love it. All around awesome. There are a lot of customization options, which is nice if you're into that. It has some really great features and you can definitely tell Android Messages is trying to catch up, but they aren't here.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Great texting app! A lot better than the default Google texting app. I love the option to display different style emojis (most of my friends have iPhones so I am able to see the iOS version of the emoji that I am sending them) I ended up paying for the premium version to get rid of the (minimal) ads and to support the Textra team for making this awesome app!,5

For instance, I work in sales, one day while showing a customer something on my phone, I received a message full of obscenities that popped up at the top of my screen.

Highly recommend.",5

My old app just quit showing me I had text notifications. I tried everything to fix it. As I researched fixes,I found out it was probably going to continue, so I decided to change.

Galaxy note 9,3
com.textra,A Google user,"The customizability of the app is far beyond what I imagined possible. My favorite for example, is custom vibrations for once a msg is received, or custom vibration for that special someone, or anyone else you can imagine. To add onto, there's custom colors you can have set for the text box (or font) of each contact within group or solo chats. A functionality pro is msg wn the notif panel or tap on the notif and have the entire chat right there on top of apps.The editing only goes on from there.",5
com.textra,Andrew,"The first app I ever paid for, and well worth it. Developers seem obsessed with convenience and usability.

I'm on a non-rooted S7 Edge with Microsoft Launcher & Chrooma Keyed app, so nothing fancy there.",5

Keep it up thanks!",5
com.textra,A Google user,An App so good you feel obligated to give it a positive rating! The stock Google messaging app does not allow you to copy selected text only. You have to copy the entire message and paste it somewhere and then pick the desired text. Pretty tedious for an app that is pushed down the throat of every android user by default!

The only improvement I would add would be on the text summary screen before clicking into a text, for larger group texts to show the first two or three contacts followed by a plus sign for the additional number of people on the text. This makes it easier to decipher between the larger group texts, when you have several group texts with similar people on them. Google and Verizon stock message apps have that.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is a very functional and reliable application. I truly do favor it over any other and I would highly recommend it. However, it badly needs a SEARCH FUNCTION for messages and I would like to be able to copy SELECTIONS of a message, and not just the entire message. Once that happens, I will immediately give it five stars.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"COMPLETE JUNK , I've lost messages on two phones. This app should be banned from the play store. There is no excuse for not syncing the SMS database both ways. Textra fails to insert text messages in the default phone sms database so you will regularly lose your messages. On my last phone, when I moved to a new phone I learned that Textra didn't insert messages to the default database for MONTHS. I just tried Textra again and the first message was not inserted to the default database. JUNK!",1
com.textra,A Google user,"I like it way better than my own texting app. I've had a few phones and they would only allow me to type out a certain number in the default messaging app. With textra, that's a different story. lots of customizing in app too.

com.textra,A Google user,"It's a great app but there's one thing that's driving me nuts. The app doesn't remove the message number badge from the main icon after reading a message. Shouldn't the number go away after opening the message? Honestly, fix this or I'm gonna have to go back to the Android default text app. But other than that the app is awesome 👍",3
com.textra,Ed B.,"Love Textra, and gladly paid to have the ad-free pro version. However, the MMS functionality is dodgy and rarely works.

I'm also not hearing their customized notification sound when they send a message.  SO FRUSTRATING as this is a very important person to stay in touch with daily!!  Please help!

com.textra,Chris Brown-DeMoreno,It looks like the app has started using uselessly small versions of your contact photos rather than the notification icon you selected for your conversations.

com.textra,A Google user,What I love about Textra is how much you can personalize everything about it. I give each person an individual notification sound. I can also give everyone their own color code and even give some people their own color LED light.

com.textra,John M,My issue has been solved!! Issue was NOT with Textra. It will NOW let me post pics with text. It apparently was the OS LASTEST UPDATE that was the cause of the changed settings in Textra. The SMS settings had changed to the (do not split message setting) not splitting large messages into smaller size. Therefore it would not post text with pics. My problem was when trying to post.

I am so upset b/c this has all I need, the color differentials to make it easier to read and respond to my msgs, of course the enlarged fonts and then the fun bubble appearance. I am sadly looking for another text app to meet my needs!",4
com.textra,E,Amazing app. Disappointed in the lack of custom vibration patterns as well as the inability to change the motivation banner colours for individual contacts. Unfortunately this is an issue with the new version of Android not Textra itself. (As these functions are still present on my old phone),5
com.textra,Eric B,"Textra won't allow responses to certain kinds of texts. For ex, when Duke Energy texts to ask if power is back on & tells me to text back yes or no, Textra gives a message not sent error. This is similar to, for ex, an invitation I heard on a podcast to ""text the word podcast to 66866 to get a listener survey."" The text supposedly sends but I don't get a reply. When Textra adds a country code of 1 before the number those texts still don't receive replies, which means they aren't being received.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"I use the paid version of Textra. Been using it on and off since 2014, it's a great app but the look hasn't changed much since then. A refresh of the design would be great as its starting to look a little dated in line with Samsung's One UI and other apps in general.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Awesome app. I have used it for years. There is a content recommendation center where I have requested and voted on features, such as naming MMS groups, that were actually added to the app. Lots of ability to customize colors and notifications. Easily the best and smoothest sms app out there.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great replacement sms/mms.  I used it for a short time and was very satisfied but it left out one feature I enjoyed with my ""go to"" messenger app(Next SMS)...the feature to schedule a auto SMS on certain days of the week.  Example...I had it send a ""have a great day"" to my son M-F.  With Textra you have to set it manually every day.  I would even pay for a upgrade if it were offered",4
com.textra,Jeffrey Ellis,"I would have given this 4 stars but am downgrading to 2 because now all of a sudden (latest version I assume - this is 4.47 on my phone) there is a stupid popup bubble like Facebook Messenger does instead of a normal notification, and I can't find a way to turn it off. Super annoying. Even after I read the text, I have to drag the bubble down to the X to get rid of it. Otherwise it's a pretty good app and I like that I can customize the colors, fonts, etc. It also lets me blocklist individual numbers which as I vaguely recall is why I started using this to begin with.",2
com.textra,A Google user,After using this app for a few weeks I would say its pretty good in terma of customization. Many apps claim to have customization but there is a lot you can change. The only thing i dislike is having to have adds after a trial and having to pay $3.99 afterwards. I would recommend giving the app a try for a good while.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I found Textra when my old messaging app stopped working correctly. I was on the hunt for a new app that allows delayed messages because I like to be able to stop a message before it sends if need to make corrections, etc. This one does that and much more. My new go to app for messaging!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"My ONLY REGULAR TEXTING APP!! BEST ONE!! I've used all original text messaging apps that comes with the phone. Like Samsung, Google pixel messaging app, and Facebooks messenger. I love this app becuz u can customize your whole experience with texting. The way it looks on your screen to how u want it sent with a return button or the send button. Totally customizable but u must buy into it to remove the ads which I did. Best regular texting app. Get it and try it out for free. Wont regret it!!!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra works amazing and it's way better than the stock messqging app. It allows me to customize my background, text bubbles, color code individuals and so much more.

Textra is awesome in real life🙌🏾🙌🏾",5

com.textra,A Google user,"All in all, this is a fine messaging app...and aesthetically pleasing to boot. I did not give it five stars for only one reason, but it's a big one. When you're in a conversation thread and you want to either add or delete a recipient, you cannot. It does not allow any changes to recipients, which means that you have to start a whole new thread and re-enter each name. If it had this functionality I would definitely give it 5 stars.",4
com.textra,Hannah Jones,I love being able to customize the speech bubbles for each individual contact. really nice app and lots of colours to choose from. my wife loves blue so I coloured her bubbles a nice blue colour and mine in that thread are a complimentary green. For another conversation with a different person I have orange and pink. Call me lame but I love the colours and customization! You can even change the shape of the bubbles. I like this app as it brightens my phone experience.,5
com.textra,Jay Sanders,I feel like I've tried all of them and Textra is by far the best. I don't know if it's specific to Textra users or if they just cracked the code but it seems to obviate the annoyance of iMessage reactions for Android users. since I started using Textra I have not received a single so and so liked this incredibly long message in a group thread! so I guess what I'm saying is this app removes the Apple annoyance that's been driving me nuts!.,5
com.textra,Kendall R. Wyatt,"I do like the features in general but when I try to send a video, there's always an error in sending it. There is an option in Textra to send videos but when you try it doesn't work. I do not have this issue with the Google stock texting app. This creates a problem because I love some of the features but I do need to be able to send videos of my children to my family from time to time and I'm not able to do that consistently.",2
com.textra,Anmol Saini,"Has been my go to sms app for the past 2 years, but now the duration of vibration while receiving sms notifications is ABNORMALLY LONG. Now my phone vibrates for a good 3 secs when a text arrives, and I've mistaken that many a times for a missed call. Please reduce the duration of vibration in the app's code. Also, no option to mute service messages from network provider while sending an sms. Microsoft's sms app has this feature, why doesn't this one ? Uninstalling until this issue is fixed 👎🏻",1

The latest update made me aware of an issue with Google messages, that could interfere with my ability to receive texts. It was a false alarm in my case. Good job...!",5
com.textra,Bobby Ortiz,* Update at the end* Have had this app for a while. Very nice and very customizable. But just hot a new galaxy watch and can't seem to connect textra to it. Is there any advice on this anyone can help out with? So after fighting around with the app and watch. It seemed my app was blocking use of the watch. It was a simple setting and it works fine.

If I could transfer with of the head to narrow it down enough then I wouldn't need to search for it... It's a shame, this app would be my go to messenger app if I didn't have to deal with this.

I had a problem with daily x-rated texts coming in from unknown EMAIL addresses, not phone numbers. I called my carrier & you have to speak to tech support but they can set it on their end to block texts from email addresses. Problem solved.",5
com.textra,Jeff Lesan,Love the delay feature!,5
com.textra,A Google user,The app was better than this current version. Now it opens in a blank message like it assumes all you want to do is send messages. I want to open with my received messages like it used to. I do like that you can still customize tones for individual contacts though.,3

Looks like there is a switch that fixes this behavior!,5

If it isn't I have to paste it into the text box and delete the other text to be able to paste the link. It is so annoying I might switch applications.,3

com.textra,Noel Bava,Edit: Please make SIM one the default SIM to send messages. The app keeps reverting to SIM two. My SIM two only works in certain areas where there is strong signal/connection.

Regardless of where it originated from, this is terrible. That was one of the best features about this app that I cared about.

This turned out to be related to Xiaomi's Miui12 dark mode and was solved by going into Settings / Display / Dark Mode / More Options and turning off option for adjusting text and backgrounds automatically for Textra.

After a bit ads were going to start so paid the extra money for it. For price of 2 coffees I'm very happy!! Love the color coding, adding different notifications. Great app and highly recommend. Update- few years later and I've added it to my new phone again. Will continue to use Textra as my default for messages.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Love Textra and all the colors! I did upgrade after the trial period bc I HATE ads in apps! It was definitely still usable with ads as they appeared across the top so they weren't really in the way to accidentally click on in case you are on the fence about the upgrade.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"So I use to use this as my default text message app. I loved the customization. One problem that has bugged me recently though is it's nearly impossible to send photos. For some reason when I hit the plus button, the photos hide behind the keyboard or something.",2
com.textra,rob Pomeroy,I have been using this app to replace the galaxy text they provide..no issues at all..does everything I need in a texting app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Used this to replace Samsung Messages after the most recent update caused my group messages to mess up. 100% recommend this app. After the free trial the ad is very unobtrusive. I set it up to only show up at the top of my textra app home screen. It does not show up when inside a text thread. A++,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Maybe we should make the conversation interface way better. Ive been using this app for 3 years from now and I do really love the app for its smoothness and simplicity, perhaps maybe we should make it more better by putting contact photos on the conversation bubbles, that way I vision it will be the hell awesome. I hope my feedback will be taken into consideration. Have a nice day fellas😉",5
com.textra,Edward Casey,"By far the most incredible messaging app I've ever used. I've used a bunch in the last 20 years, and Textra has some really awesome features and is constantly updated. It works quickly and flawlessly every time. I've bought it at least 3 times and don't even think twice when I do. A+",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is one of very few apps that I felt it worth it to buy the premium version of. Not because the ads are disruptive or annoying, but because this is such a convenient, simple, customizable texting app that I wanted to toss some money to the dev team. Awesome product.",5
com.textra,O A,"All seems very good. Thanks a lot. Only minor suggestions: Allow different Bubble Colors for dark theme. Add a confirmation step to the ""mark all read"" under menu as it can be easily pressed by mistake when going to settings. The 3rd button in Notification Android Heads Buttons is disappearing when there is a ""copy"" button automatically added.",5
com.textra,David Jaques,"It is the most integrated, customisable and easy to use text app that I've come across. I believe it's well worth the $5 for the advertisement-free edition as it has improved my user experience and it's constantly being updated and improved (monthly!).",5
com.textra,lovelywaz,"Great features but one major issue. It does not make any sound on new message, just vibrates. Even if phone is not on vibrate/silent, it simply pops out a box silently. I have missed to read important messages because of this failure while sleeping since there was no sound at all.",2

I have been using Taxtra SMS for a long time and I'll use this app for a long time I have no need to change or try some another app bicoseTextra fit all my needs.Easy for use, has a nice messages bot, which gives you a tips. The recommendation is: Install Textra SMS. If you want a huge, complicated app with a bunch of unnecessary and irritating content then Textra is not for you.",5
com.textra,Jim Hines,👍 app. Textra is constantly making improvements. I maintain several work and personal calendars. Very easy to switch views of each on and off. I appreciate that I am able to customize the colors used to highlight various views. I really like this app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love Textra, been using it for a while, but lately its been glitchy. I no longer get notification message alerts or sounds even, and I have to pull up textra manually to check on any updates. These problems resolved after I uninstalled Textra and went back to my default SMS app, so not sure if textra was somehow interfering with my SMS notifications.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Best I found after looking over several others. I love the send delay so you can change your mind after hitting send. It's kept me from doing something stupid a couple of times now.

If an issue arises (which is very rarely) they waste no time to try and resolve it! Look forward to future updates!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I really like being able to color code text bubbles for different contacts. After repeated uninstalls and re-downloads I am not able to send media. A sudden departure from what was normal. Even text began to send very slowly. Had to give up.,3
com.textra,LJ P,"Did NOT sync with my stock app! Made all messages get mixed up with each other in stock app (and EVERY other SMS app). A years worth of Messages now appear to be gone.

com.textra,A Google user,"I really like the app verses the stock plain Jane. The options it gives you are great, BUT the merge contacts is a one way street. Merge them and ""that's all folks"". Like it or not your stuck with it. I had to redo my entire contacts, took a week. I'm not a major phone user, but I like to be able to undo something as an option. Just in case ME NO LIKE! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 on this one oversight. For all I know it could have been part of this new phone. Bounced it off the wall alot !!!",4
com.textra,Kary Miller,A lot of great features. My only complaint is that it appears to limit the number of blocked numbers. Wish it was unlimited.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Love that you can change colors of all messages sending and receiving and you can change the message style format ie bubble, tear drop. Absolutely love using this app!! Cons: having to pay $4+ to have just the ads removed. I'd like to get some special features included with it!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"LITERALLY the only messaging app I can find that doesn't break my texts into 10 individuals which get delivered in an indecipherable order. My fave perk, you can pick how your pop ups appear & pick what action buttons will appear in it AND where exactly ON the pop-up it will be located. Good for leftys. Not 1 negative thing to say. Gun to head forced to pick 1 thing I'd add? Transparency option on text bubbles/slider color selecter, solid backgrounds are hard on my eyes contrasting to the fonts",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Amazing! This app is fantastic and well designed. I was actually looking for and app which would hide texts for certain contacts, however, I loved the app so much that it's ow my default messaging app. It has some great features, is easy to use and has a nice interface.

Please help me with this.. thanks.",4
com.textra,Rachelle Carson,"Love this app! I can pin convos, schedule texts, and color coordinate my messages. Only reason it doesn't get a 5-star is because texting videos never works right (at least for me). And once a group text is created, you cannot remove (edit) sendees. I share more as a result. BUT it's the best Android lovers have right now.",4
com.textra,Chris Williams,Love the app! Since the last update though anyone/groups I had muted remains muted even after I unmute them meaning no notification sound or new message notification anywhere. However receiving a text from them still causes the screen to light up as it would when a message is received. Would be great if possible to fix this!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I was forced to look for an alternative texting app because the current Samsung stock app has lost the ability to block spam by phrase, only by number. Textra has this function, which is great. I think it also responds much more quickly to incoming messages. The developer responded promptly and helpfully to queries. 5 stars.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"this is most annoying messaging app I've ever used. every time you open the app to tap the most recent text, there is a small delay before an ad appears in its place causing you to click the ad, and the ad doesn't always appear so you cant predict it.",1

com.textra,A Google user,"3/18/22 I ❤️LOVE❤️ Textra!! Changing the iPhone user reactions to symbols was BRILLIANT!! Thank You! I have bitten people's heads off for reacting to every text I send because quoting my texts made it impossible to go back and look for something specific. I also love the ability to edit colors and fonts. Maybe someday we'll be able to ""react"" the same way...? 👍",5
com.textra,Richard C.,Great app. I really appreciate the added features it has on traditional messaging and have had little or no problems with Textra. One feature I would like to see added is the ability to choose a different tone for the repeat notifications.,4
com.textra,Pete Peter,"When I bailed on Apple iPhone products many years and went with Android, I didn't realize there would be a texting app decision to make. Textra has been a great choice for me ever since. Pay the nominal cost for the Pro version and enjoy regular feature upgrades and solid performance. Most used app I've got and love it.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I switched from Chomp to Textra SMS when I discovered that Chomp didn't work properly on my new phone. Textra works well and Delicious pointed out that I could learn more about cool stuff I could do with the app by texting ""tip"" to the Textra Bot. Wow! There's so much more flexibility and handy short cuts that weren't obvious. Textra SMS is definitely a keeper. It's just so flexible and customizable, how could you not like it?",5

May be time to go Premium simply to say: Thanks!",5
com.textra,Daniel Davis,"I love this app. It does so many things right. All the customization you can do. My favorite is how you can copy a part of a text. I've had this app for 3 years and no other app compare. Now, I hope Textra will add RCS (rich communication services). RCS is a really cool feature that all texting texting apps should adopt.",5
com.textra,Lynn Matthews,Good app. lots of color themes. Lots of features. Rarely has glitches. Good stuff.,4
com.textra,James Ford,"This is by far the best app for texting I have ever used. The display is highly customizable, with a wide range of colors.

com.textra,Genevieve,"Great app. Easy to share photos. Cute stickers. Works much much better than the Verizon messages app that came installed on my phone.

com.textra,Ms Lena B,I really enjoy this app and would have given 5 Starts if not for the issues I've had most recently. I've even recommended the app to a few friends. HOWEVER two things that I don't like. #1. I just got a new phone and and can't transfer text messages. This Sucks because some of the old text have information that I need to view later. #2: I'm in a group chat/meeting everyone else can give reactions to others text except me. When will this features be added?? 😫,4
com.textra,Jonathan Bailey,"I was a user of Textra for years and then all of a sudden message delivery was inconsistent.

com.textra,Brad Becker,"Beware of this App. The free version has ads that are disguised to be regular ads like Amazon, but it turned out to be malware. Mistakenly clicked on an ad and my checking account was compromised and had to report to my Bank to get the matter resolved. Textra wants you to pay for the pro version so no ads are in sight? I have to pay you for security? No thanks. I went to Pulse and am not looking back They are the best experience for Android, oh its ad free. Get Pulse you'll thank me later.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app. Way better than Google Messages in terms of customizing views, font, colors, emoji. Only downside is that the Google Assistant integration can be buggy when it comes to re-reading messages marked as read through Textra. Occasionally, group MMS chains from friends with iPhones are broken up into separate chains over time.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"app has been good and reliable in the past, i use it specifically for custom alerts for some contacts related to paging alerts.

I can block texts from complete numbers, but I'm the victim of a spammer who keeps changing their number. The prefix (area code) is always the same, but Textra gives me no way to block by prefix! So I must blacklist each and every number individually, multiple times a week. This is becoming intolerable! Either let me block by prefix or give me a way to block all texts from outside my contacts list. (Actually, both options would be ideal!) Otherwise, I'll be looking for a new texting app very soon.",3

com.textra,Paul Sterman,Better than most. No easy way to find unread text messages that got buried.

com.textra,A Google user,The main thing I love about this app. Is that messages can be scheduled to be sent at a later time it works well always so i use it for my default But if I switch to another app for the archive option it does not transfer all of the messages that I have which is unfortunate. I would much appreciate an archiving option.,4
com.textra,Lance Nault,Best SMS/MMS app on the market hands down! I've tried them all. Edit: April 13 2020. I ran into a problem (a mistake in the settings on my part) and had to contact support.

I have a Galaxy S10 and Active Watch 2 and the Textra app on the Active Watch 2 is the only app that I know of that has ""Mark as Read"" (which is incredibly useful), so I use Textra when I'm at work and on the go and then Android Messages at home with the watch off. When I put the watch on and switch to Textra I go into the app info, storage, and then clear cache and data...this resets the app and pulls up any messages sent not using Textra. Not the best solution but it works. Android Messages is going to improve though over the next year, so maybe develop software that can work with it or a web version of Textra? Long time user, and want Textra to keep going and be around for years.",4

I'm not one for ads so yes, I did pay for Pro but it's like $2.99 and that's it, you're good for life, they'll likely never ask for a penny again! You can do more stuff with this app than there is space on this review for me to list. Colors, shapes, sizes on and on and on. I love it.

But recently (maybe after I got android 11, Samsung UI 3) update in December, it no longer produces an on screen pop-up message when I get a new message. That was my favorite thing about this app. I could set the message to STAY on the screen until I dismissed it (unlike other apps which stayed on for like 2 seconds). I see no settings to handle this anymore. Did this feature get removed?",3

Nice job, devs.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I have only used this app for a day. So far I am plessed with the things I can do. I do wish it contained a scheduling prompt so that I can text things at certain times and send it at a later time. Perhaps after using it a little longer I will be able to give a better review or a higher rating. I am in Blue Heaven! I followed your instructions and found out how to schedule my texts to send at whatever time I want. I planned on playing around with it later but glad I don't have to now. Thank you,5

com.textra,Shaun McKay,"I've been using Textra for years and it has always been fantastic. I read on another review recently about the Icon change going to 2 layers per Google standards. But it's the only icon I have that now has the white background. Is there a way to use a transparent base layer or something? It just doesn't look professional anymore. Also, I'm not getting the notification on the icon anymore when I get a text. I'm using Nova Pro, and it doesn't allow me to change the bottom layer. Thoughts?",4
com.textra,A Google user,works very well. i like the fact that i can assign individual text notification sounds for contacts. Would you think about putting the phone icon next to the person's name on the actual screen that you type on instead of having to use the drop down arrow as an extra step?,5

Made the switch to Google's message app only for the use of RCS and I miss this app to say the least. If textra could support RCS messaging, this would be the best app hands down. But until then, I guess I'm stuck with one of the few that uses RCS.",3
com.textra,Chequita Hilliard,I loved this app when I used it before switching cell phone companies some years ago. I came back to it recently and I'm giving it 2 stars because the notification does not work. I've tried and researched my settings and it just NEVER notifies me of a new message. It would be great to even get a silent notification but that doesn't work either. 😕 I have to check the messages ever so often to see and have missed important text.,2

Definitely beats the stock messaging apps, and I've had a lot of LG & OnePlus phones.

Regardless I'm happy with how this app always performs and how often it STILL gets updates😌",5
com.textra,Raylene Royal,Love this app! Works great. I used to use goSMS pro and everytime I woikd try and send a message I would have to completely close every app on my phone or it wouldn't send.

com.textra,A Google user,"My favorite SMS app, but unforgivable bug deleted all my texts... If I actually cared about any of those 3k sms/mms from the past few months that weren't backed up, I would be LIVID. I went to delete two spam threads, pressed the open trash can like I'd done 100x, and before I knew it all my texts were disappearing. And there was no button I could hit to stop it or undo it. Just had to watch in disbelief. Shame because I really do love the app and ALMOST spent $$ to get no ads, but now I refuse.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Downloaded this app from the play store (moto G4) and had a problem that it wouldn't delete any text messages and always force closed the app everytime I tried. left a negative review and within 12 hours the Textra team emailed me a new 'fixed' app that works perfectly. A great customizable app with excellent customer service. I shall upgrade to pro when the time comes. Thanks.,5
com.textra,Andy Berks,"Unable to attach photos. That's a serious feature shortcoming. Otherwise I like it. Update: tech support said the ""+"" button allows photos.",4
com.textra,Christin Conly,Need to be able to force a resync of contacts as typing names in Textra doesn't pull up all / correct contacts that are in contacts widget. Would be nice if Textra would minimize Android z-board when reading messages. Is often in way and requires constant minimizing. Otherwise I like this app because the text box is larger than native Google pixel texting app.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Been using the app for a few months. Love the delay feature, to correct the auto text and any errors. emojis. Favorite feature is being able to send/receive MMS while on a call. Old app did not do that. customize is nice but dont use it to extent as others.",5
com.textra,Milton Smith,Very good so far. I can send messages on a schedule. I could never get Google messages to do that!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I switched from Chomp (by the same company) to Textra because Chomp is apparently no longer maintained. Fortunately, Textra has been upgraded to have many of the features previously only available in Chomp, and it works great! No bugs found yet. It means I had to pay for the ad-free version again, but it was worth it.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"A friend recommended this app to me and so far it hasn't disappointed! You can pick from several different emoji types, which is cool. And you can pick the color of your texts and stuff too. It's a lot more customizable than the basic Messages app on my pixel.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Awesome app with custom colors, excellent dark mode and notification repeat that I use to make sure I don't miss important work support messages. I've seen complaints on MMS, but I use the feature constantly and have very rarely had an issue and none recently. Would like RCS support, but not a reason to stop using this excellent app.",5
com.textra,Lover of Music,"Love the app but why is it, every once in awhile, I have issues with texts not sending right away? All texts, to all contacts, all day, for a few days, and then it's fine. It's annoying but the app is great. I've been using it for years, even with the ads. They're not annoying at all.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"It was working great for about 2 weeks (I have the paid version) on my OnepPlus 7 Pro but now messages from one specific contact are blank.  If forward the blank message it will show the text or if I long press to copy/paste when I paste I can see it.  I know its a Textra issue because as soon as I changed back to stock app, all messages show.  This happened last time I tried to use this app, its why I switched to Yaata.  But when I got this new phone thought I would try again.  Also says it supports dual sim but cannot find how/where to choose sim per text.  Can't find how to reach customer support other than leaving review here.   So for now, 2 stars, tell me how to resolve above issues and/or get help I will go back to 5 stars.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Went overseas but did not change sim. Since coming home my texts have all recreated into a new group. Today everything mysteriously merged together. Now Textra has deleted a bunch of old texts that show on other apps but not textra. I cant even download the texts that appear on other apps. Too many problems and I paid for pro level. I will probably stop using this app once and for all but am hesitant since I paid for the app!,1
com.textra,KERRY AKERS,Terrific to use with colourful features.👍👌,5
com.textra,A Google user,Fantastic app. Two things that annoy me. Would be good if when picking a recipient from a group that the names were sorted alphabetically. And when replying to a message that has been sent to a group it would be good if I could choose to send to only the sender and not everyone.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love this app, I have the Pro version, it's worth it. The feature I love most is the ability to send an entire thread to email. I can create a summary of a past conversation in sn email, or send data to another app. Keep up the great work.",5
com.textra,Joe Perez,"I've used the pro version for a while and I still love the app. The colors customization is still something I mess with till this day. I know other messaging apps are trying to compete with iMessages, I mean Apple at this point.

com.textra,DJ Anointed 1210,I used handsent for years and it always works great but then it stopped working correctly. It was always kind of temperamental. Textra worked easily and exactly how I want it to from the very first text. Ty for a great product. Even using the free version the adds aren't overwhelming.,5
com.textra,Neil,"UPDATE: I'm now on my fourth phone with Textra, and it's continuing on a brand new Pixel 5 to not want to send MMS messages consistently or quickly, whether I'm on LTE or Wi-Fi. I'm now surprising that it's a problem with Textra and not my carrier or my phone. ---PREVIOUS REVIEW: I've already ""reviewed"" this by paying for it, but a really smooth and well-sorted app. Kudos.",2
com.textra,Chris Osborne,"Have used Textra for well over a year & loved it up until a few days ago. Messages aren't sending, retry to send and still nothing.

I press resend and its a 50/50 chance that will work. I have Uninstaller and installed. I loved all the features in textra but if I can't get it to work for its main job I will have to find another.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"This has been a very easy and straightforward texting app. The predecessor text app I was using was showing its age, so it was time to download a new one. Textra has done it's job. Very reliable and smooth to navigate through contacts to call and text. I'll thank the creators for making this text app. Cheers.",5
com.textra,Eric Schwab,I used to love this App but lately I have been having a issue with it. It WILL not send any kind of picture messages it trys to send and it just fails. Even the smallest pictures in size 155.9kb. I have no issue sending pictures using Googe messenger. That the only issue I have with it. Also support team is not very good on getting back to you. I wish it sent texts and pictures over WiFi. I hope there is a fix out there I have not found yet.,3
com.textra,Jason Mathison,"I had been using GoSMS for years! Their customer service got worse & worse, plus any time they did an upgrade it was at least two steps back! I switched over to Textra about a month ago & have been extremely pleased! I have sent a request to have them set-up a Privacy folder for certain contacts, then this app would be more than 5-Stars!!",5
com.textra,Traci Jamilah,"Two stars because since I've selected and downloaded YOUR app, I STILL haven't been able to get emojis, gifs, etc. Even with the updates for ""so-called bug fixes."" This app was highly recommended to me but I haven't really experienced why! STILL unable to download emojis and gifs available for Textra. ""Mandy"" with the Textra team suggested that I reboot my phone. Like, WTH?! Getting unsolicited emails from random email addresses as well. No workable solution has been offered. Looking for new app",1
com.textra,Joe Owen,Love this App. I've been a paid user for years now. But lately I can't reply to 5 digit number text I receive from my Doctors offices. But if I use the Samsung Messages app I'm able to send a reply. Also just today the Textra app stopped sending text messages. I can receive a text message just fine. I switch over to Samsung Message and all my text are working as normal. So I think it's a bug in Textra app. Is anyone else had these problems. Hopefully it will get fixed soon. Thanks Textra!,5
com.textra,Jolene Barrett,"I love this App, I have used it for a few years and I have NEVER had any issues. I do not pay for it so there are adds, but they are hardly noticable and not annoying at all. I love that I can customize so many things in this app. I won't use any other texting app, not even the one that comes with the phone. TEXTRA is the only text messenger I use",5
com.textra,Keith,"It has been a good app for years, but in recent times it struggles to send texts and media. The app will tell me it failed to send, and I'll resend, but then the recipient receives multiple of the same texts and media. I can't figure out what is wrong.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"This app is very customizable and efficient. I love that I can choose a different color for each contact so I know who texted me just by seeing the bubble pop up, and the choice in colors is essentially limitless so I'll never have to worry about running out of colors",5

com.textra,Marwan Eid,"It's very good. I use this for my work so I literally send hundreds of text to dozens of people daily. The only issues I have with it is if you partially open a text and start texting and don't send it but close the text, the text you're working on gets deleted.",4
com.textra,Angela Staley,"This is an updated rating, after yet another upgrade. Once again , I'm getting the MMS timeout error. Which shows I have A constant message. It's annoying, because I'm constantly checking my messages🙄. It happens everytime you guys do an upgrade/bug fixes.",4
com.textra,T VH,"App randomly deleted ALL of my messages and conversations on my phone. Did not select the delete option, just opened the program. Cannot recover texts since the program does not store backups in default SMS program like indicated in their documentation.Found that this is a complete lie and all SMS texting programs use the same database, so nothing was retrievable, no texts left on default SMS. Trying to send a support ticket through the app fails every time as well. Not Pleased at all.",1
com.textra,A Google user,I really like the app. it allows me to lock messages so they won't accidentally be deleted. I also love the customization options. The only negative so far is the ads in the free version. Update: thanks for the tip! That is much better (custom ad placement).,5
com.textra,Ejike Oguh,"Very fantastic SMS app with many useful features. Update: They fixed inability to send SMS to mobiles that you don't want saved as contacts. However, if you want to quickly copy and paste two or more recipient mobile numbers you have written out in text file, there is no delimiter that you can use e.g. comma",4
com.textra,Mariah Mills,"Great app, worth the purchase! I like that I can customize the themes even for a specific in individual chat, I can schedule texts, I can leave it marked as unread after quick preview and pin it to the top of all messages as a priority and it stays there until I remove it. Great functionality and design 👍🏽",5
com.textra,Bob Greene,It's much better than the stock text program!,5
com.textra,Ian Nelson,This has been my go to app for texting for over 6 years. I enjoy all of it's customization options for theme/colors and you can set each contact to its own customization! The blacklist feature is very handy when you just need to block people out of your life. 6/5 stars from me!,5
com.textra,A Google user,Would like the ability to edit a message that has a timed send applied. Once you set the time and date the message can't be altered so you must delete the entire message and recipients and start a new message. Otherwise great app!,4
com.textra,Vanessa Bishop,"I have used and uninstalled plenty of apps, but this one. This texting app is perfect. It is not complicated or over whelming. Comes with cool optional features like- personalized notification icons for each contact. Customize the conversation with different colors. I couldn't be more happy with this app. I get every message, I never have issues. Not even one complaint. Even the ads are perfect. They stay localized at the very top of the screen! Love this app!!!",5

The app runs flawlessly.",5
com.textra,AlyAttackful,"I've been using textra for years, and I prefer it over the carrier's messaging system.

Again I love the customization but this bug is really annoying.",2
com.textra,Fides Monique Paderna,"This is my primary SMS app for offline messaging.

Overall I think great app",5
com.textra,A Google user,"App has great response times and customization capabilities. Gifs and lots of emojis available and the ""Blacklist"" to block ppl is good.

I have even changed the developer options which was supposed to fix the problem, but it's still happening.",4

It's clean simple to use and not too complicated and the text option for help or just hints and tips from TextaBot is handy and he's cute. l even don't mind the ad and now Textra have very kindly just added the option for me to choose where it goes.

Whatever feature I feel I'm missing that gets me to try other apps (like a web interface) just ends up not being as being as important as the customization options I have with Textra,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I don't do a lot of texting, but have fiddled around with Textra quite a bit. It does everything a messaging app is supposed to do, and does it well. The options for configuring the app are endless. If it has any faults, I have yet to find them.",5

com.textra,Miss Fun Fun,Everything works ok except that I don't get notified anymore when I receive a text unless I open the textra app manually to check. It's quite annoying since one of the most important things that a messaging app should have is NOTIFYING a user that they got a message... At first it was just a delay in getting my texts or delay sending out a mms... But now that isn't a problem anymore and instead I don't get notified... please FIX...,2
com.textra,Hakari Yuzuka,"This app (Textra) is what we needed. Hopefully, this you will find this app To be useful to as well. I block unwanted calls with it.

com.textra,A Google user,If you're tired of the boring of messages on your phone don't hesitate download textra. It's very customizable...when you download textra you will be downloading the free version but after the free trial is over a message will appaer and you'll have the option to get the pro version of textra. I promise you can't go wrong with textra it's the absolute best app,5

One day Samsung, for whatever reason and no warning, got rid of the ability to differentiate text message ""sounds"" for each contact. I don't know about you, but I rely heavily on those different text message sounds, to know WHO has text me without looking. Was it unimportant or was I waiting for a specific one? And text with customized colors BONUS! sry WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FIVE STARS",5
com.textra,A Google user,The ability to customize the design and presentation of the interface is really awesome. There are lots of options too. The app runs smoothly and messages come without delays. definitely a must have app for android phones.,5
com.textra,BLI MN,Cannot send a video with this app because it just errors out. When I try to attach a video directly from this app it doesn't show videos in the gallery. I'm not being mean but I already wasted money when I purchased Chomp and it would not work properly with a Moto G7. The stock Google app always works just fine. I have tried all the troubleshooting recommendation and settings and nothing solved my problems. Don't purchase this app untill you have tried it! Just hope Delicious do a better job.,1

Lately I've been having an issue that I need to reinstall Textra every couple of days though, I've been a pro user for a few years now but something in a recent update made it so it's not recognizing that I purchased pro, Usual fixes don't work, reinstall fixes it but only for a couple of days.",4

com.textra,A Google user,I've been using for Textra for 2 years and it has been amazing up until about a month or so ago. I'm no longer able to send/receive MMS when connected to WiFi. It's absolutely annoying; especially when I'm unable to received things related to work. Why the change?,4
com.textra,Charles Cumberbatch,Very clean & easy UI. I got a problem sending a single message to 21 contacts and it failed to send each time. I reached out to SUpport and Jason responded swifty within minutes - which i wasn't expecting.

com.textra,Barbara Hodges,"EVEN THEIR HELP BOT TEXT DOESN'T WORK. HORRIBLE SUPPORT. I don't know if I am sad or pissed off I have used this for years and Loved it. Then the last two updates destroyed that. The settings do not not stick. No matter how many times I set them or how many times I reset my phone, the notifications are not working. They either pop up for a split second and God forbid they play the sound. So went to get help, NOTHING! BAD help page, not contact number. So I have to find a new texting app.",1

Whenever I send a group message to family members or a private message to a customer after selecting the contacts and sending, Textra randomly adds others to the message. Causing confusion to the person who received the message and embarrassment to me. Textra still hasn't addressed the issue. For now I'm going back Google Messages.",2
com.textra,A Google user,I really like the app. It works well and I have been completely happy with it. It's easy to use and I like the fact that you can change the colors and font. Lots of versatility compared to other apps. One thing I wasn't too fond of was the ads. They just started popping up today and I have had it installed for a couple weeks. Must be initially ad free in the beginning? How do you go about paying for it? How much?,5
com.textra,J Lichterman,"Only quibble is that, and I am not sure if this is a textra feature or android phone app feature, but I used to be able to create and store custom text messages to use reply to a phonecall. Now there are only 3 stock messages or option to type a custom message when rejecting a phone call. I really miss that feature.",5
com.textra,Lorraine Evans,"The keyboard/text that comes with my phone is always inferior to Textra. I love love love being able to schedule text messages. When I think of things to tell people it's always 1:00am not a good time to send a text! So I create my text while its fresh in my mind and then textra sends it in the morning while I'm asleep or showering, it's awesome! I also use textra to schedule birthday messages, so even if I forget the day of, no one knows because Textra sent it for me on time!!",5
com.textra,Jenny Smith,So I really like all the customization options. Wish I could actually change the background. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's not getting all my texts so there is clearly something very wrong with this app. Started using it the other day as suggested by the MightyText app team because I was having issues and this app is fully compatible with the app but sadly I cannot rely on this app to make sure I'm getting all texts so I can't use it. Fix it and I'll consider coming back.,2
com.textra,A Google user,Love all the customization...would be awesome to be able to have a wallpaper in background. Just wish Samsung hadn't gotten rid of the custom notifications settings for individual contacts. Otherwise this is a great app. Really beginning to like it since past issues have been fixed.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"of being able to pic colors for individual conversations and the ability to pic vibrate, tones etc so a message won'tbe missed. Not happy that you removed being able to choose a color indicating a message is received. It's difficult to see the new icons because they are white and small in size.",5
com.textra,Rollin Summers,Absolutely love it since a few years ago. It was a life saver after Samsung had the brilliant idea of removing custom contact sounds! Love it and recommended to my wife who has a new phone - the Galaxy S21. What the heck the sounds are gone and it alliws you only to go to Android sounds for default noises!! Does this mean Samsung have finally derailed even the fabulous Textra?? Please tell us this is not so....,5
com.textra,Yari Nieves,"I want to give this app 5 stars but I can't. Mainly because lately it has been very slow at sending my txts and pics. I have all kinds of bars, so its not that.

com.textra,Tee Mizzle,"I like Textra so far. I just installed it, after Mood has gone completely downhill. But the big problem with Textra-- and it's a dealbreaker for me-- is the inability to move it to the SD card. I will not stand idly by while this app eats up all the internal memory on my phone. So uninstalling. Bummer too, because I just customized it and everything.",1
com.textra,Kimberly Horne,"Good looking and typically functional, but the lack of spam control makes this app unusable for me.

I hope this can be an added feature one day.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Long time user. Best text app for notification customisation. Removal of custom coloured notification icons in recent build caused me to revert to a previous version as this was an incredibly useful feature. I'm aware it's a restriction put in place by Google rather than the app developer and would love to understand why they have denied developers this simple and useful ability. Short-sighted of Google.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Loved this app to start with and even paid for it. Everything was working well until about 9days ago. For some reason I can no longer send group messages. It just won't send. I then have to send the same text to everyone separately which is so annoying when it previously worked. Please fix,2
com.textra,PinkTM,works as good as your regular message app... can customize colors to match ur phone and use dark mode or black screen instead of white... never reopens regular messaging progràm ... going pro only charges you one time and you have it for life . even if you get a new phone. it still knows that's you've purchased this already! no ads at all what so ever.

com.textra,A Google user,Great app however recently it has stopped notifying me when I get texts. I have tried a few solutions (reinstalling etc) which works for a while but the problem arises a few weeks later. I'm going to have to uninstall for this reason which is disappointing because I paid for the app and love using it.,2
com.textra,Linda Barker,"I've used Textra happily for several yrs, but recently messages sent and marked as 'delivered' are not being received. Reached out to 'help@textra', but the response from 'Mandy' was that I should D/L one of two addl 3rd party apps in an attempt to isolate the issue (which I see others are also experiencing). Not helpful & not happening! It was a good run Textra, but I'd rather switch to stock or Google. I don't wish to be used as a test case to solve your problem - or to D/L yet another app.",2
com.textra,Patrick Kessler,"Would receive 5 as it has great features including delayed send unavailable in stock app. Ads are unintrusive.

com.textra,A Google user,"I loved this app for almost a year, then recently it stopped receiving almost all group messages. It's very inconvenient because I'm not getting texts from work, or important events.

com.textra,R.C. Perez,Great overall throughout different devices as I stated before. The reasons for only 4 stars is the fact that you are missing one crucial setting for an app that is highly customizable...BACKUP & RESTORE. When you have various contacts that.have been individually customized it is a pain to redo them all over again.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is awesome because it works just like you expect, just like the built-in app. But much faster and with nice added features like being able to respond quickly while in other apps.

I sent an email to the link shown on the app page at the same time I posted the review.",1

com.textra,A Google user,"I only downloaded it so that I can assign different notifications to each caller. Stock S9+ messenger was just as good for me except for the individual notifications for each person. Good app. Only thing I found a bit troublesome was navigating settings to find how to open full app when replying from notification bar rather than the default quick reply, ended up googling it lol.",5
com.textra,AYP,"I'm happy with my choice of Textra as it allows nearly full screen viewing when composing an SMS. A big improvement on the messaging app pre-installed on the Moto E6 which is a terrific handset, but that app only displayed four lines of text at one time during composing which doesn't suit folk who write wordy texts..",5
com.textra,Trisha Watson,"My preferred texting app for over 3 years! It handles alternate keyboards well, has an easy and configurable UI, and keeps everything neat.

com.textra,A Google user,"I've used a great variety of texting apps over the years and I can happily say that Textra is my all time favorite. The amount of customization you can do is perfect for someone like me who has weird and obsessive requirements when it comes to the appearance of my phone and how it functions. Textra has some of the dopest features. If I had more than 500 characters I'd elaborate on that statement. I don't review apps cuz I'm a nobody, but the Textra devs earned this fosho. I love you guys.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I really love this app but would love it if they have a desktop app so that I can text from my computer! Mightytext and pushbullet both get invasive with information and require a monthly pro subscription to be able to send texts consistently. Google texting has great functionality for this but unfortunately textra does not. Textra should really step up their game for this,3
com.textra,A Google user,"I am not tech savvy at all. I use this app because my Droid default text app always split my group texts to individual texts. This app works great. There is always an ad in the form of a text in the very first spot, but it's not annoying and doesn't bother me at all.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Amazing app and have been a faithful user over many different devices (currently Galaxy Note 10) and find it superb because of the many features (customizing colors, themes, individual conversations, individual notifications for contacts, etc). Would give 5 stars but only 4 because I don't actually receive notifications for texts nor do I receive numbers on the app letting me know how many texts if any I have unread. I just have to check manually. Please fix!",4
com.textra,DeMarcus B,I've used Textra for a few years now. The only issue I've had with it is that every once in awhile for a block of time my texts won't send. It will only have the loading symbol next to the text. It's very frustrating. Thankfully it hasn't happened during something important.,4
com.textra,Adrian Martinez,Like the app alot but can't send or receive video. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"""send as email"" function only sends a list of the contact the text went too, but doesn't send the body of the text so that's pointless. Needs to have an archive to save texts. Needs to have the ability to establish different notification sounds for different contacts.",2

com.textra,DS Skaff,"I love it. The signature feature is the best. more importantly, their support is prompt. My review has been on here a while, but the more I use Textra the more I like it. Very versatile and you just can't beat the signature function. Support...so prompt, so helpful, just plain good!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Constantly fails mms messages, even for the paid version, & despite reaching out to support. This has caused a lot of problems on my job.

com.textra,A Google user,"This app does all the SMS / MMS basics relably and well.   I love the clean, uncluttered interface.  I love the fact that it plays nice with my Samsung Gear S3 watch (running Tizen 4). Textra allows me to reply to SMS messages from my watch with the watch's built-in messaging functionality. With most other SMS apps I have tried, when I press reply on my watch, it tells me ""Check your phone"" (i.e., reply using your phone).  Room for improvement;   Sent message bubbles occupy only half the screen width. Received message bubbles occupy only 3/4 fot he screen width. This causes message text to elongate vertically, making it more difficult to read. Please make available optional bubble styles that occupy more screen width.  There is no ""Speak Text"" option when you select a bubble. Please add this -  your own older SMS app ""Chomp"" has this!   There is no ""Private Inbox"" function, where selected conversations can be made private, hidden from the regular conversations list and accessed by password. This is becoming a common feature in many SMS apps. Despite these feature shortcomings, this app is a keeper and is my favourite daily-use SMS/MMs app at this time.",4

I uninstalled it and reinstalled set it bac up 2 my liking, exited out of it and now it won't open. It just keeps on crashing. This is annoying because I truly love this app.",4
com.textra,Dennis Merlino,I have been usintTextra SMS for a few years now and am happy with it. I use it because I can select personalized sounds for different people. The advertisements it has are unintrusive and I hardly even notice them. Its a good app. 👍,5
com.textra,Zeta Topp,I enjoy the variety and ease of customizing my texts. This is a fine little app with nice features. Especially considering that its free. The Textra Bot is a great feature because it pro-activly teaches a little without constantly annoying you. Less is more. 🙂,4
com.textra,Victoria Hall,"I love this app. I love that it's customizable and it has worked really well for me the past 2 years. My FAVORITE feature the bulk texting, so I can send pictures to multiple family members without it being an annoying group text. The family loves it and so do I. Thank you for making such a great texting app! ❤️",5
com.textra,Nehmar Ahmad,"There's an issue going with the app, the text is not delivered, it always gives the notification ""Message Sending Failed"" in the first attempt and when you tap over the resend, it succeeds then often. Not a good practice as often the important texts get delayed because of some bug",2
com.textra,Greg Moore,"Super easy to use and set up. Customize the appearance of messages in multiple ways (bubble and text color, bubble shape, etc.) Really appreciate the Blocklist to get myself out of annoying group texts LOL! Overall a great and trouble free app, get it on your phone!",5
com.textra,A 166,"Far better SMS app than the default ""Messages"" apps. It rarely fails to send text messages, pictures and short video segments. Will Textra get end-to-end encryption and be able to send documents? I'd like this app to send pdf and other non-image files.",5
com.textra,cuneyt Cakir,"This messaging app is awesome. I have low range phone (xperia sp) that's too old, the default messaging app (the sony messenger) was to slow and sometimes doesn't popuped new massages, so i decided to install a new messenger. The performance is fine, UI is freaking awesome and highly customizable, The instant reply for messages works great, and the blocklist is good idea. Special thanks development team. Best regards.",5
com.textra,Karen Huff,"I have been using Textra for a while now and I love it!!!! I absolutely love being able to customize my fonts, colors, notifications, and emoji styles!!! I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who wants to spice up their texting and make it more fun and pretty!! 🤗",5
com.textra,Alexa VL,I did love this app but i started having issues where i wouldn't recieve texts from people i wasn't already having an active conversation with. I usually have to unistall and then reinstall it to fix the problem. I still use textra cuz i like the design of it but its a really annoying issue. Edit: i was able to fix this problem by myself by resetting some network settings. Very annoying but it migh not have been textra's fault. Edit aug 2020 textra now isnt sending pictures i send.,4
com.textra,Garry Smith,Great so good I paid to remove adds. But since upgrading to S10+ it wont notify me on galaxy watch. You couldn't send sms from watch but you could be notified on previous A3 and that was all I needed but with S10+ itwont do either watch does receive sms just doesn't notify. Have had to go back to Samsung's crappy app. Much rather this thanks.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I'm absolutely blown away at the optimization of this app. It is absolutely FLYING, there's nothing like it! Free but ZERO ads, all major functions are here, none of the junk, and you can customize the color and look EXACTLY to your liking - BRAVO!!! Absolutely epic app, best purposed app in any category! I humbly thank you!!!",5
com.textra,Sarah Lloyd,"I have been using textra for a couple years and I really like it. It's much better than the default app that comes on my phone. I do think it could be even more customizable by veinn able to change backgrounds, extra colours etc. Great app tho.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using textra for years and I really liked it. But since last year with every new update things go wrong with it. Textra is very buggy now. Text notifications don't show or is hidden quickly, therefore I read my texts late. No more dual sim mode! Really annoying, I'm switching to another messaging app.",2
com.textra,M Crenshaw,Interesting that the developer feedback wishes for more stars but basically ignores feedback and fails to adequately respond to concerns especially the fact that their update of about four months ago introduces a mandatory pop up to an sms where a link is present. This should be a setting to disable this. No response leaves the impression there are other motives for doing this other than users privacy/digital safety.,1
com.textra,A Google user,"Just completely stopped working. My husband has texted me 15 times today. None came. If it's possible for someone to be blacklisted without me doing anything, then there really is a problem. 3/17/2020 it's happening again. Family members texting me, it doesn't come through. I can text them. The alert on the app is on.",1
com.textra,Joe McDade,"Best part of this texting app is being able to email from it. I've used sms txt apps, social media txt apps, the corporate txt apps, and the pre-installed phone txt apps and this is the only one you can text to an email from. Getting photos, orders, appointments, tasks, etc.. from customers family whatever and being able to forward to my email for later is very helpful when I get back to my desk. Thanks Textra for making life better!",5
com.textra,ChK1lZ (ChK1lZ),"Been using Textra with the premium add-on for so many years now. Simple, feature-rich UI without throwing the kitchen sink at you. Never lags. Never force closes. Plays well with my root customizations. You only know it's there when you need it... Like an app SHOULD work. My only ask for a 5 star rating would be a backup option independent of Google services... Though from what I've read that's a tough feature to add. Do that and I'll happily add that next star.",4
com.textra,John M,"been using forever without issue, haven't found a reason to change yet",5
com.textra,Maxime Vaillancourt,"Hands down the best texting app I used and actually kept, especially considering how customizable everything is. The free version was already with it, but paying a little support streamlines everything even more. Unfortunately it seems like the custom vibration position is gone, but I loved it...",4
com.textra,A Google user,Best messaging app so far. I had no regrets in paying the pro version. It's highly customizable that it meets your all preferences. Please add a feature that we can use our photos as background and add transparency to the bubble colors to make Textra a wonderful messaging experience.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Faster than built-in SMS app. So very customizable it's amazing. Actions and reactions, many sound and vibrate options including custom patterns. . If I must offer a suggestion. The only thing I can think of is ability to set chat wallpaper. No complaints of any kind. WELL WORTH COST OF REGISTRATION",5
com.textra,Mark L,"This is the best integrated Gmail/text I have been able to find. One of the features I like the best is that you can access the groups you setup in gmail. Most of the other text apps you have to setup new groups within the text app. Also, it is very easy to use. Support is also great. I sent a note to the developer and got a response within 24 hours.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"My android has a lot of issues when it comes to texting, but this app fixes everything and makes everything work like it's supposed to. Haven't tried the customizing but it looks good to me. My only concern is this app storing my data but I usually use social media to text people so this isn't a big issue.",4
com.textra,Zbojar,"With all due respect, this app sucks! Perhaps some good features are there I didn't find it. BUT texting someone who is in my contacts with multiple ph# don't let you see what # you sending to. Send to a landline. So I changed default# in the contacts for this person still Textra sending to the landline. can't tap the name to see #! Annoying ads in the app that is NOT any different than any other smartphone default txt app. Hey nobody is perfect but this really sukcs DO NOT PAY FOR THIS IS APP.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Very nice app for texting... Allows customization including the option to assign different bubble colors to individual contacts (something Google removed from Messages). My biggest gripe is that you can't archive messages. I like a clean inbox, so to speak.",3
com.textra,Professor JAJL,"A really nice, customizable app that gets regular performance updates. I prefer it to Samsung's stock app for its customization features! I think issues with things not sending sometimes are on my end, but it is something users may want to take note of.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"What a disaster. I installed this on my Galaxy S4, chose it as my default messenger and it saw the messages that had been shown in the Samsung default app. So far so good. Unfortunately, it would not send messages or receive them. I then tried to use the Samsung messenger and it would not send or receive either. I eventually uninstalled Textra. This seemed to release my sent messages via the Samsung app. I am still unable to receive any messages on my phone. Thanks Textra!",1
com.textra,A Google user,"it used to be five star however it's become undependable. I get notifications for a text but no text, only the notification:, ""Can't get MMS: timeout, tap to try again"" and nothing happens. completely unacceptable. additionally, when I text people they say they never received the text. people call me and say they've texted me and I don't receive them. I've done reboots restarts uninstall reinstall nothing seems to work. I must uninstall this app because it is no longer reliable",1
com.textra,Callea StGermain,"Great App, but just wish that there was a feature to block ALL text messages except those from contacts..because of that only 3 stars..I bought the app because it works so very well & I love the custom features that it has, like being able to personalize each text tone for my contacts...I'll keep it, but please add a way to block ALL text messages except those from your personal contacts to keep out spammers & scamners.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"This app is nice and allows you to customize different people with different colored bubbles, also you can name different group chats. There is also options to mute chats and pin them so they are always at the top. I really enjoy it for what I need.",5
com.textra,The Awakened Soldier,"I like the app but when you restart your phone it doesn't stay on your home screen you have to go in the minue of the phone in other apps just to put it back on the main screen everytime I restart the phone also Stage fright protection would still be nice and other text protections as well like a virus scann for text woukd be nice overall it's still a great app very customizable to, and I look forward to future updates.",3
com.textra,Danilo “Jay Jay” Napalan,"I've been a Textra user for a long time and always prefered the fast speed over the default messages app, but unfortunately on the new Z Fold 3 when trying to reply to Bubble pop-ups via Textra there is an issue that the keyboard doesn't popup when trying to reply. I've tested with other apps using the bubble Pop-up and the keyboard does work there just not with Textra without having to manually click the keyboard button and selecting the same keyboard again and then it will pop-up.",1

com.textra,A Google user,"until this last update it was great. since then I get a cant send mms timeout error. have psted on FB., no response. I shouldn't have to put in airplane mode, to reset it several times a day. Textra is blaming Android. after contactinh textra it worked fine until the March 12 upgrade. Same problem again. I uninstalled it.   UPDATE:    I did email you (included all our prior emails as reference)  I haven't heard back. I've done everything you instructed me prior and it's not working again.  Thank you for your timely response, but I've uninstalled Textra.",2
com.textra,tyler meiners,I have enjoyed Textra for years!! I've tried others and have always returned. Recently all my saved/learned words are gone. I don't know where the option is to get them back. I'm not sure if it is due to an update here or something with Android settings. Any thoughts?,5
com.textra,Geoff Waters,Better than Samsung messages on my S10 which wouldn't say if messages were delivered and kept converting to MMS if too long with resulting BT charges,5
com.textra,A Google user,This works so much better than what my Nokia 8 came preprogrammed with. I was missing out on group messaging. Frustrated I was ready to buy a new phone(my Nokia 8 is 4 months old).When my friend recommended Textra I was happy to give it a try.I ended up buying the app to avoid ads which is still way cheaper than buying a new phone.The only thing missing(& the reason I give it 4 stars instead 5)is that it doesn't include badges telling me how many texts I have.Had to get different app for that.,4
com.textra,Dennis Stovall,Works great. Fast. Consistent. Pleased. Best text messaging app I've ever used.,5
com.textra,d lo,"I have been using this messaging app for almost 3 years now. Never had a problem until I recently purchased a new phone; I stopped getting notifications. After exhausting everything I could do to try to fix it, I reached out to Textra's team of specialists to help. MAX got back to me a few hours later with an update that completely solved the problem. I'm NEVER using another APP for SMS. Thanks again Textra (Max)!",5
com.textra,N.J. Guzman,Very Customizable app. I love the time delay in sending text (just in case auto correct changes words)or I change my mind. -1 star U can't blocklist from convs menu. I don't want to open a conv just to blocklist. Don't want to see it again.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I've used this app for years and love it, but for some reason I can't send messages or pictures. This usually only happens when I'm not in service area, which is pretty rare. I'm definitely in the service area now.Just tarted today. I really hope I don't have to go back to my stock texting app. Samsung S9.",2
com.textra,A Google user,It's been a solid replacement app from my default pixel 3 sms app. Why I use it is so that I can have persistent notifications (in tandem with lawnchair launcher and notifier). The GIFs could be a bit smoother but overall it's a good app. I use the free version so you get to choose where the ads pop up which is nice,4
com.textra,Ryan Dickerson,This is by far the best messaging app I have used. I came from Samsung Messages which has no customizable interface. This let's me change literally anything. It's like designing your own messages app! I decided to get the $4 upgrade so I don't have to see ads!,5
com.textra,K.Romeo,"Minus 1 star for not allowing to set a time schedule for ""Day and Night Theme"". Right now it only allows you to enable your location to use that feature. Sorry no thank you. Best Texting app available. Making it more compatible with Apple's messaging app is probably the best direction it could go. Also this is the best messaging app Ive ever used. Thank you Textra! I'll be a life long user and will tell my friends about it!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I've enjoyed using this app. I've been pretty happy with it but I'm disappointed that the new update no longer allows my notification icon to be a different color. My different icons are available but they're all white now. White notification icon is boring and not enough contrast on my screen.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I have tried so many other 3nd party texting apps and nothing comes close to how awesome Textra is. When I found Textra I knew my search was over. I have been using this for years now. its interface is simple yet elegant.. its strange, and the customizable options are amazing.. Thank you to the awesome team who work hard on this app.. I love it and appreciate it more than you'll ever know..",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Absolutely, by far the best messaging app I've ever used. You can customize even the notification icon for each contact. Which this was a big shocker for me. I love the simple design and quick compose messaging option. . Download it, you won't regret it.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've used Textra as my main messaging app for years. It's no frills and reliable. But it still has just enough customization to keep it pretty. Even when I was using the free version, the advertisements in app are subtle. I have upgraded to pro to better support the developers. Thanks (:",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Still the best app I've used so far, but recently messages have stopped vibrating my phone. Settings are set for vibrate, and other apps vibrate just fine, but textra won't. Edit: I factory reset my phone, and things are moving buttery smooth again. Thanks!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is actually the easiest, most user friendly messaging app i've ever used. It is so simple to use, even with all the customization features available. I truly would recommend this app to anyone looking for a new messenger application simply for the fact, that I have used this app for YEARS and still have nothing to complain about, besides the ads. They do offer a paid version with no ads obviously, which is very worth it for a mere $3.99. Thanks Textra developers for being awesome (:",5
com.textra,Casey Norris,"Loved the app until latest update, now I can't get MMS messages, and I've never had this problem before. I've tried all the suggested fixes but it hasn't made a difference.

com.textra,Jeannie Gardner,"I love being able to text!! I went without a cellphone for almost a year and that was so hard. ... I know a lot of people and the phone is, right now, the only way to talk to them. I just never had time to call and talk very much.

com.textra,A Google user,I really loved the app until the last update. Now when you get a notification it makes a sound & vibrates. It used to let you pick when it vibrated. This is the reason i have switched from other messaging apps so hoping it will change back soon since the app seems to get updated every few days,4
com.textra,Rick Madsen,Hate new mini menu. As others said just adds extra taps. Maybe that's what it stands for now T(aps)extra Should be optional. I've only been using it because of extra lines in msg composition. But may not be worth the effort now. Accidently opening URLs is dumb user problem not a developers problem.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"I love how beautiful and customizable it is. However, I really miss the contact sound notifications. I dislike having to keep conversations and infividually customize them to the scroll through them for use in order to have the notification sound inform me who I'm talking to as messages come in. Sigh.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"This app is my favorite so far, but I have a few problems with it. When I go into certain contacts messages it shows messages from the beginning of this year or from a frew months ago. It also doesn't show all of the messages I sent or the contact has sent. It makes me sad that I can't use this app because it is my favorite one. 😢",3
com.textra,A Google user,"must be my pixel 2 thats acting up. I downloaded this app because the default messaging app was acting up not downloading messages, and showing unread messages when there were none. Downloaded this app to replace that but couldnt even click onto a message thread without the app freezing and asking me to close the app. It also populated message threads I had deleted months prior. Bad first time experience.",1
com.textra,Jason “Jay” Yates,"Not happy with Textra Support! I have used their app (ad-supported) for years now and finally decided to help the developer out by purchasing the pro version. Well, since then I am missing messages and I have been unable to send some MMS messages. I finally contacted Textra to explain my issue and ask for a refund. But, EVERYTIME Textra replies back they point the finger elsewhere. Example, my wife's phone isn't sending ME her text. Her's and my stock messaging work fine on my Google Pixel 4 XL.",1
com.textra,Chris Brush,"Great than bad, I had been using this app for years but unfortunately I had to Uninstal due to constantly unable to send messages, I would have to tap resend almost 3 to 5 time on every other message I sent which is a highly iritating. That was the bad, now if they fix that issue I will more than likely return because all the other feature the offer is far greater than the factory or other messaging app I've used thus far",2
com.textra,Shelly Ryder,This app works perfectly and is a much better experience than my phone's default texting app.,5
com.textra,Red Cell.,"i wont give 5 stars only because the ad is annoying when it moves as you are about to hit a recent text and makes you click the ad. idk happens to me a lot lol, if it didnt move my interface it wouldnt be irritating. other than that this is my favorite text app. clean, light, simple and customizable.",4
com.textra,A Google user,I love being able to mess around with my messages and edit them it's fun to just sit in class and mess around with the settings. Its amazing I definitely recommend it. But itd be nice if we could put pictures on out backgrounds for the people we're messages.,5

I get message failed everyone once in awhile but not sure if it's bc of wifi or the phone carrier I am with. I would recommend it to people to use, it is my number 1 app for text.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Really good app! Has features a phone does not and lacks of. Works great for work purposes with great organization and color coded contacts. Group texts can be renamed and pinned to the top for easy accessibility. And so much more support to make life easier using this app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,By far the best texting app I've used. The fre version does have some ads but they honestly aren't invasive at all. Juat a small bar when viewing different conversations. I was happy enough with the free product that I bought the premium version just to support them.,5
com.textra,William Pippin,"Textra works really well for me. I've been using it for several years. 12/04/2021 This is probably my problem, but just curious to see if others find it s little bothersome. When I am typing my text, I have to be really cognizant of the last letter at the end of each line. If I don't watch it, I will prematurely send the unfinished text. The send moniker is really close to the position I mentioned. Is this just old age or have others done this. If it is my technique, I'll just be more careful.",5
com.textra,Linda Brown,"Easy to use, bright & colorful. Totally customizable! I have 2 different profiles and realized the pro version didn't work on one of the profiles.

com.textra,Gary Hudson,Several things. You can't change colour of font. You also can't lock it unlock messages. And you need to do a double tap on rubbish bin to delete. Most sms apps have a small box that pops up that you can tick to delete. Or even press and hold text message then a option pops up to let you delete. They should fix these. I'm going to uninstall because of these bugs,3
com.textra,Derrick Givens,"I transitioned from the iPhone last week and I have to admit I really miss imessage, the stock message app on the note20 was very disappointing. So glad I found textra because it Saved me from returning my Note 20 ultra for another iPhone. It's the closet app to imessage I've found to date. Beautifully designed yet simple and functional . Now I have the best of Android with a message app I can live with that kept me on board with Android. Kudos to the developers .",5
com.textra,Becky Argenti,"I have been using Textra for a couple of years now. The only thing that I wish it could do is block wildcard numbers. I get spam texts from several area codes/prefixes, and it would be helpful to be able to block text messages from an entire area code. Other than that, I love it! Great app.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Really simple effective text messaging app. the biggest gripe i have is that when I swipe on notification in the notification bar i still get my reminder notification. If i wanted to be reminded about the message i wouldn't swipe it away. *edit* I don't want it to be marked as read. I just want the notification to stop. But when I open the app I want it to show I have unread messages. The reminder notifications should only be for if I leave it in the notification bar.,3
com.textra,Paul Henrichs,My favorite app. I have used this for several years on multiple phones. I love you can customize contacts and colors. The only time I had trouble turned out to be an android issue and not the app. Highly recommend this as your default messaging app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I didnt even have the app for long before I decided to uninstall it. Extremely glitchy and kept freezing on me when I was doing the simpliest tasks like changing my message settings. I also downloaded the emoji keyboard but somehow that got uninstalled as well?? Seems promising but within five minutes, the non-stop freezing was too much for me.",1
com.textra,Smitty J,"Preferred sms app for a few years now! It cannot Blacklist a Group Chat\Conversation, but hopefully will do so in the future. EDIT RESPONSE: tried that for the last year - still cannot block. (one person +14ppl). It's weird. UPDATE (2\1\2021): discovered today, I'm using v4.18; v4.29 lists improvements to the blocklist features... Updating now!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Overall, I really like this app. It has been reliable and I like the personalization of it. If I could change one thing about it, I would love to have the option for all members in a group chat to be able to have a different bubble color. It makes it easier to quickly tell who sent what message.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"The app is good. For me, the whole idea of downloading this app was to have an easy option to delete messages by using the option ""select all"". unfortunately select all option is not available instead each message needs to be selected. Is it possible to have this option? This will help to select all messages at one short and uncheck whatever is required to retain.",4
com.textra,A Google user,I really loved textra for the past couple of years but recently I have been not recieving some of my text messages but when I use the default app of my phone for messages I have no problem with it.

com.textra,Mike Mandel,Does everything I need it to do. Sometimes I'll have a notification for an unread text but can't seem to find the text. I also have trouble with group messages at times but I'm pretty sure those are related to issues with Android and iPhones being in the same group messages.,5
com.textra,Fine Autolines,"Was the best app until recenty :( There is no easy option to forward messages - Instead we get a share button. I used textra primarily for the ease of forwarding messages.

com.textra,Tara M,"I really liked this app until today. I went into find a pic a friend sent me a couple months ago, but when I looked for it, I noticed anything sent to me more than a month or two ago, is not just blank space. I select it, same thing, I tried opening it with my photo gallery, tried saving it and opening it, but nada. Very disappointing that I lost my pics and now need to find another app",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Oof, mostly loved this app until just recently. Messages will say they've sent, but then I come back to the app later and I get a bunch of error messages saying none of my texts were sent. Other than this, my messages send multiple times in a row, which is ridiculous.",2
com.textra,Melissa Baker-Farmer,"Great app! I've tried a couple others, but ended up sticking with this one- preferred it by far!

com.textra,Martin Kimani,"It's a good app, would give it a 5star, but every time I try to send sms to multiple numbers it shifts to mms. I have tried playing with the settings but it's just not working out. It a deal killer for me since I frequently require to send sms to multiple numbers, yeah I'll have to make due with the default msg app.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Pretty convenient and simple. The quick response without interrupting current app is my most used feature and there is no clutter. The ads show up only at the top of your messages list so they aren't intrusive as well.,5
com.textra,A Google user,The best text app out there. Very customizable and clean looking. Never had issues until the most recent update. I can no longer send or receive MMS messages. I have emailed support and hopefully they can help resolve my issue.,4

I'm still up my review to 5 stars way better than messages and chompsms.",5
com.textra,Jeremy Spiers,I really liked this product until the latest update. Notifications no longer produce sound for some reason. It needs to be fixed quick or I'm going to have to go to another service as I am self-employed and need my notifications to get information on potential jobs. Update: fixed!,5
com.textra,Steve,"#1 complaint: Textra is stuck in internal memory; I am unable to move app to external memory. My own Textra app will soon surpass 1GB in internal memory, and my phone only has 9 GB of available internal memory, most all of it used. (I am a low-paid worker in disability services, btw.) #2 [minor] complaint: If I query the google search bar on my home screen while writing a Texta msg, my msg disappears. Google queries via Opera don't cause this. NO OTHER COMPLAINTS!",4
com.textra,Jayden,I'm not a big reviewer but I had to give 5 stars to Textra because not only is the UI the most friendly I've tried but it blends in so well with the Android ecosystem. Samsung has improved its messaging app but I still prefer textra because the level of customization this app allows the user is insane. It's a blend of elegance you would see on an Apple device with more ability to make it your own. I wanted more than my stock texting app and wasn't interested in gimmicks. Textra delivered.,5
com.textra,Dimitri Ajazi,"With Textra, my Android 10 Pixel 3a receives msgs from iPhones but not Android phones. Next: I can't *permanently* disable Quick Compose, no matter what I try. It is always reenabled after a cold or warm boot. Developer's 2020-08-20 response didn't help. It did *look* great while it was on, though, and its notifications of incoming iMessages worked great, especially compared to the Google Messages app, which has really spotty notifications. So, developer, please refund my Pro purchase? I uninstalled Textra within hours of installing it. Sadly, the Play Store forces developers to refund instead of doing so itself, like it once used to. Does Google still keep its 30% cut after refund? I wouldn't be surprised.",1
com.textra,A Google user,I've been using this app for so long now it's just become second nature to use it for any messaging needs. Good stuff guys! After searching through the settings I am unable to find the option to pay for Textra Pro. I'll wait 14 days like it says in a support article and see if it pops up on there in that timeframe.,5
com.textra,tonya woodall,I absolutely love this app!!!! It may have an ad every once in awhile but it doesn't bother me at all! I like it that I can change colors of the bubbles and add in little gif's too. It doesn't take long for the text to go through either! Thank you so much Textra!!!,5
com.textra,Lyla Black,I love this app. However all of a sudden I am having tons of problems with failed messages sent. I try them again and they fail to send again. I have NO idea what the problem is. I'm using a Note 10 and getting extremely frustrated!!,3
com.textra,A Google user,"I left my previous provider as messages were not going through when I had limited service. Living in a rural environment, I need reliable service to communicate with my family when talking on a phone is not an option. I have been using Textra for about 2 months without any issues. attachments go through flawlessly, and my family appreciates the reliability Textra brings to our communication needs.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I have used this app for months and LOVE IT! I searched high and low for one that would allow me to have a multi-line signature so I could include my professional credentials! Textra not only does that, they let you have as many as you want so I have a personal one for family and friends, an address identifier for when I text home contractors, one for hubby texts, and more! Great app!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra has changed my life in so many ways. I can schedule a message,recall it,have it on my drop menu for easy access and many many other things.. it's so customisable and great for multitasking on the go. I strongly recommend it to everyone...",5
com.textra,Don Sveen,Worked great for a long time but now suddenly it will not open received Amazon links with one tap. You must cut and paste into Chrome browser in order to open the link. It did not used to do that. ( this feature works fine on Google messaging app). Please advise and I will change my rating,2
com.textra,A Google user,This app is great and provides the customization Im looking for. It is sad that Samsung and Google dont provide simple color or style preferences. Google's chat bubble is blue text on a blue bubble.. Really?? Guess they dont do much usability testing. Thanks Textra for putting users back in charge.,5
com.textra,Jason Turner,Textra is by far the best texting app! Been extremely pleased and have used it for years,5
com.textra,A Google user,Works better than stock Android text app. I used to never get pictures and drop group MMS messages at random so I was always out of the loop. I don't miss anything anymore and Textra even found the old stuff in my history that Messages missed! So happy with it and paying for premium was a no-brainer for me,5
com.textra,iamknosound,"Nice to customize contacts since Android dropped the ball on that. Sure has there been any reports of receiving delays or is that solely based on my carrier only? UPDATE: This was a carrier and phone setup issue, not a Textra issue. This is the best app for SMS. Unlimited options. 🤙🏽",5
com.textra,Azrin Sani,This is great app and nicely priced. However it suffers a major flaw of unable to send mms. I had a group with 200 contacts and sending mms to all of them failed. There was no error message or logs to why it failed. Yes 200 recepients may be large but they could have broken the recepients into smaller chunks and spread it over time to avoid the send limit. Something which would be a common sense thing to do. I had to uninstall it. Though i give it 5 stars to support the developer!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"textra is good just wish there were more color options. its too restrictive on what you can customize and has limited color choices, most of which I dont like. also you can't customize vibrate pattern when set to ""only when phone is on vibrate"".",4
com.textra,A Google user,I had to switch because of my Fitbit. I lost functionality like sending scheduled messages. getting into the sending is different. It easy will go to another conversation in the middle of a conversation. BEWARE.... I summary it works but not the greatest but not the worst.,3
com.textra,SirHotness,love this app but can you please add a feature when you're leaving audio that you can lock the audio so you dont have to hold the button. basically lets get on board of the telegram and whatsapp type features at this point.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Problem. No audible notification. I like the app. But sometimes it only vibrates and does not make a sound, when I receive a text. The sound on my phone has volume at medium and inside Textra, under options, it says that it will play a sound and vibrate. Help?",3
com.textra,Nolan Sekol,"Please be Gboard compatible so I can see the beautiful Android 10 emojis on my lovely Gboard and it would also be nice if there was Emoji 13. And a very nice feature is you know where the add button is in there in settings you can change horizontal, vertical or maybe Tilted (Unstable) . IF ANYONE IS looking for a Android 10 Emoji SMS App here it is, free SMS and MMS service . Oh sorry if this is long but I forgot to mention Emoji Search. Also Textra Keyboard should be a seperate app.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Very good app for textos. Better than the usual one with a smartphone. So many things you can setup. The notification, the color, each contact, icons, even the icon of the app and so much more. I love it and I recommend it.",5
com.textra,H AlJayyed,"still no app-based (instead of system based) date format, blocklist not sorted by date, app settings (including blocklist) cannot be backed up, unlike Google' SMS app the text field doesnt get disabled when sender doesnt support replies. these are simple things that i have seen requested for years but continue to be ignored by the devs. the overlay feature & ""mark as read"" are currently the only reasons i continue using this app instead of Google's.",3
com.textra,Sci Dog,"Oh No! Latest Galaxy Note 10+ update makes Textra's text input display jitter about upon the screen. Green lines underscoring text all over the place. The screen focuses upon these green underscored text words randomly, like a demon has the cursor. I am sure it thinks I am being helped, and I will bet this is not Textra's fault...but it is definitely your problem. I love Textra. I bought it. This will all get fixed I am sure, but right now it's like I am typing in an earthquake. Help!",3
com.textra,Jeffrey Leath,I started using this app when messages started to big down from too many messages and conversations. I like the costomization in the app and that it is very user friendly. Me and my wife use it and the ability to adjust everything even the way it displays notifications is awesome to me.,5
com.textra,Sophi Proffitt,"I got this so I could schedule texts, but the customization options and ability to use different emoji styles (iOS/etc) are really cool as well. it's just an overall better texting experience than the default app in a bunch of ways (not to mention all the other useful features I've found myself using since I have them now)",5
com.textra,A Google user,this app is great for Samsung users because Samsung does not let you have group chats with apple so on this app you can. All you contacts and text messages stay the same too. The only problem is after a while it starts to give you adds if you do not buy the premium version. Over all the app is great and I highly recommend it.,4
com.textra,Jonathan Kelly,"Used it for years and loved it but recent update did something to my MMS messages and pictures. Keep getting ""cannot receive MMS - push to try again"" type messages. Also, video from iphone is awful. Probably mostly apple's fault, but still. Had it for so long I dont even when I got it, but I'm guessing I went pro like 4 or 5-ish years ago. Not many issues until this year. Only rated 1-star to get attention of company so they fix it - will change it once they do.",1
com.textra,Melissa M,"It's ok, but not 100% reliable. I discovered the hard way that long texts don't communicate well. I've had to re-text long texts into several one-sentence texts, which I find incredibly annoying as it interrupts my train of thought.",3
com.textra,Kate D,"Other than not figuring out how to stop additional auto spacing after punctuation, I am enjoying this keyboard. I would also move the comma to the quick punctuation as 1st choice and have the period on its own key. I wanted something free that would suit me better than Google's keyboard. This is the best I have found so far. It is very user friendly in other respects & easy to set up.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I paid for premium and for about a year have been loving it. After this last update, I'm having the same issue others are having with sending/ receiving MMS. Cleared cache partition, local app cache, rsync within the about section. Finally giving up on my dear textra and going back to stock. Annoyed with all the failed MMS notifications.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"Generally good. The Textra Bot is so annoying because its messages do not mark as read so I always have 1 message alert. Only way to fix seems to start a reply to bot and then erase the draft reply without sending. Then the 1 message alert will go away. Mark all read does not fix bug though, only disguises it for a while..",4
com.textra,Krishna,"Issues with MMS. Never know if messages actually get delivered. Friends complained that their gifs or pic messages can't get through. Been using this app for over a year. Liked it more than the stock Samsung one, but both suck. Looking to find an alternative one",1
com.textra,Boomer R,"Fails to send messages all of a sudden. I also miss texts all the time. Makes me sad because I really loved this app when I first downloaded it. I even raved to my pals about it. But now I have to uninstall it so I can communicate reliably. And I'm a bit embarrassed because it's been failing my pals too. Hehe, that'll teach me to recommend an app.",2
com.textra,David Turcotte,Developers are quick to respond to (and actually resolve) issues. My issue was resolved but then stopped working. I cannot use Textra anymore. It hasn't worked on only device with Android 9+. I'll be following up with devs to see what the issue is. Right now it's too unreliable to use.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"I had read good reviews on this app before downloading. My last messaging app was good when I first got it and then I wouldn't get all my text messages and would take hours to receive some. I am glad I made the switch to textra, I have had no problems so far and I love the app. I would highly recommend this app if you're looking for a new text messaging app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"this used to work great. now messages won't send, its completely updated, I don't receive messages either. I try resending messages and they just sit there and load. they never actually send. this app has a ton of bugs. ive used it for years but within the last 6 months or so it's just compete garbage now.",1
com.textra,Christopher Pohlman,"I've been using Textra on and off for a while now and love it. It's a great, simple to use messaging app that checks most of the boxes for me... If there was only a feature to allow customization of backgrounds, that would put this over the top for me",5
com.textra,A Google user,Textra is an excellent SMS/MMS replacement. Does group messaging and picture messaging very well and it's heads up reply function is excellent and very customizable. It also plays well with Samsung's RCS messaging and T-Mobile's WiFi-Calling and WiFi-Texting as long as your phone is able to handle it. It remains to be seen if it will be able to handle RCS Universal Profile when it finally hits my Galaxy S9. Textra is made by the same developers as ChompSMS but is more advanced IMHO.,5
com.textra,Chadwin Johnson,"Love how the app allows you to customize everything including color, text type, emojis and more. It integrates very well with smart watches and works extremely well. My wife and I use it and would recommend to anyone looking to fully customize their texting experience!",5
com.textra,James Soyars,"This app is amazing! It integrates with Google to be able to send group texts. My favorite feature is that I can create a text, and schedule when I want it to go out. Textra is BY FAR the most useful app on my phone. I would have given it more than 5 stars if I could.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Really great i love how easily you able to access and send text with ease i also love the choice of ad instead a stupid video there is an ad in the text bar which is ok with me i can still work around this on the free version. Overall really awesome texting app would reccomend this to any one looking for a speedy way to deliver text.,5
com.textra,Early Cuyler,"Started out great, but starts not showing new texts over time and you miss messages. App has to be uninstalled and reinstalled until problem occurs again. I have to double check my messages several times a day to find unread messages marked as read. Very frustrating.",3
com.textra,Anonymous Person,"Never thought an app could lose mms messages, but this one proved me wrong. Pray you never lose data service and receive a picture/group message, because the app will fail to receive it even when your phone finds service again. I now remember why I stopped using this years ago. Can't believe it's still a problem.",2
com.textra,A Google user,I love this app. So far it works good with no hang ups or problems. I love the gif choices. The only criticism is that I wish it had a better auto correct on it. I haven't looked in the settings to see if the way it works could be changed.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Android Messages was acting a little wonky on my phone so I read about this app on reddit and decided to try it. Great experience! Love the option to change font sizes. Hopefully soon they'll add more full RCS functionality. I want to see if someone has read my text!,5
com.textra,Len,"Used pro version of Textra for some years and have been very happy with it. Recently changed my Sony for a Samsung and Textra was compromised with conversations missing. Contacted their tech team and was impressed with their profesnalism, couple of days tweaking the code and it was good as new. Customer service was excellent, really deserve 5 stars, well done.",5
com.textra,Aasim Inshirah,"With fantastic features like delay send, I'm disappointed that Textra doesn't offer texting via a web interface. This is something that services like WhatsApp and Android SMS Messager offer. I think web texting would be a great feature to offer, especially considering the number of people teleworking. I'll still give Textra 5 stars because it does an outstanding job operating as advertised. Web messaging would make this my hands down favorite.",5
com.textra,Mike Wallace,This is the best texting program there is. I've been using it for years with exactly zero problems,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app! I've used it over the stock Samsung messaging app in conjunction with the Google keyboard. Overall, I love the customization of it and it makes my messages look incredibly clean. I just wish i could put a wallpaper in the message threads so i can give it a pattern as opposed to light, grey, and black. Regardless, still a great app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"An amazing app. Been using it without any complains and it works perfectly fine with me. If for example you want to have a message app that is similar to iMessage or Huawei's, this is your go to app. I payed for the full version as well so I don't have any problems with ads. Just great, 5 stars 👌🏽",5
com.textra,Bryan Hensley,"I like this app pretty good after I found out how send videos and how to arrange ads. However I it's aggravating how I have to send videos. It's a shame I can't scroll down though the gallery instead of having to back out of the conversation, find the video, type in who I'm sending it to. But I don't send many videos so I'll live with it. Thanks for telling me how to send videos",4
com.textra,Shmuel Goldberg,"In Textra I found repeat notifications, which, in my opinion, are extremely important in order to to miss a message. I received instant support from the developers. Everything looks good and works well!",5
com.textra,The Tuesday Test Drive,Why does this app drop the conversation after hitting send? Does anyone test software anymore? Its about as annoying as the Samsung text app that won't show you an entire message. I guess I'll have to add a text app by Blackberry to make sure everything works - like the hub. Amazing.,1
com.textra,Dajuane Runyon,"I figured out the problem with why I couldn't send MMS, and It didn't have anything to do with textra app. But I still need to be able to block all group chats before someone send them to me. Like there need to be a setting where one can turn on and or off group chat. Group chats are annoying and I don't want to receive them period. Thank you so much. You have ⭐⭐⭐⭐.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Had to download it because the SMS program built-in on my phone was buggy. My only issue is that there's no search function for looking through keywords of messages. Editing contact information could be designed a bit better as well. Other than that solid product.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Good text app. I have an Android phone and I like to use the microphone to write/say messages, however, sometimes the microphone does not work. I believe it to be from the app because I have no problem with the microphone on other apps.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"been my favorite app to use for texting for a few years but recently its been extremeley inconsistent with sending and receiving messages. my partner and i have been going crazy thinking its our phones but we switched over to our stock mesaaging apps and voila, all our texts are sent and recieved perfectly. sucks because we both paid for the app too.",1
com.textra,Kims Forevermore,"Loving the textra app since I switched to android phone.. The only thing I wish to add is to customize the wallpaper background while texting, like I can change the background color to pink one 😅. I also want to change the date format into Long format. Example: Sunday, May 24, 2020 😍 Thank you Textra Team. Hoping for the next update turn much better from the previous version. 😍 God bless",4
com.textra,A Google user,This app is really awesome. I installed it because the new update on the Samsung didn't allow you to have a different text tone for different contacts anymore. What I discovered with this app is even better. I used to have an iPhone which for contact personalisation is the best and this app even beats the iPhone for that.,5
com.textra,Ian Bell,"super dope messaging app. lots of customization options, super fast messaging speeds, just looks & feels really solid. there are ads but you can just make a one-time payment and they'll go away forever! and that little bit of money will help them make this app even better :)",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I was using Textra for the millionth time just now and paused and thought I love it so much I need to tell it. This is the coolest texting app I've ever used. I switched to Textra from Google messages a year or two ago. And of course I missed some things like the vibrate pattern I always recognised. Well, Textra let me RECORD MY OWN vibrate pattern so now there's nothing to miss! I emailed customer service one time and even they are great.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Haven't had any issues with the app so far. I've been using Textra for a good while and compared to the Pixels own messaging app, this is way better. I actually get notifications and can see the message that's sent within group chats I'm a part of. Pretty simple and self explanatory of an app.",5
com.textra,Adam Zaloum,"Everything about this app is great except one glaring issue... The SMS notification is by far the *most obnoxious notification* I've ever witnessed -- straight-through vibration for 2-3 seconds for each message, especially annoying when in a group chat... For an app that has ""so many features"", I was shocked to find that you can't modify the vibration pattern for a message, and I find myself putting the phone on silent just because of this... HUGE MISS for an app that is otherwise very good",3
com.textra,De Lena,I love this app primarily because I can silence one individual's notification or ringtone. It also gives me the ability to set special notification tones for each individual. I love this because I know who is texting or calling me before I even pick up my phone.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"This app is one of the few apps I have ever took time to write a review for. It's just so packed with features and user friendly. The interface is very appealing, and everything is customizable. I think everyone should ditch the old SMS and use Textra instead.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've only been using the app a few days and am impressed so far. This is the cleanest, user friendly, simplistic, and fluid running app I have found. It's a pleasure to use this app and look forward to texting. The design is simple and eloquent. I'm sure I'll purchase. UPDATE: 11/30/2018 Very pleased with this app so I purchased. I actually like the shapes better than the colors. UPDATE: 8/02/2019 I've been using Textra for about 9 months and I'm completely happy with it! Best app out there!",5
com.textra,Ed Naus,Really like it. I'm using the free version with ads but I might spring for the paid version since I use it every few minutes lol. It's a great app. Not buggy and I love the schedule texts feature -my main rain for switching drum stock messaging app. Also very customizable!,5
com.textra,A Google user,The app is great. It allows you to have multiple colors during a group chat that helps with identifying who's responding. Ads do appear after a while but they aren't bothersome and intrusive like others I've experienced.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Got it for the notification repeat option. I'm surprised at how much nicer it is to use than stock and and I like the customization features. I'd give it 5 stars if you could set the time between alerts not just the amount of repeats.,4
com.textra,C Mcd,"Installed, now going to uninstall,tryed 10 times to send SMS And nothing, just comes back as failed 😡, this is a couple days later, Ive topped up my phone now, there is credit in my phone, I can use the textra messaging service, with out credit you can't text not even over wi-fi I like the layout of the app it lets u customize your chat,its nice and easy to use, enjoying just now, only been using for a day, so I'll add more stars or take away if anything changes all in all, at moment it's nice",4
com.textra,Rebecca VanSickle-Boyce,"loved it in the beginning then all of a sudden I start getting alot of txt messages from different ads. I am adding to my review 2 yrs later, I really enjoy this app & alot of its features. BUT, it doesnt always deliver my pics being sent if I dont have my wifi & data on at the same time.

com.textra,A Google user,"Solid SMS app, a bit annoying that they hit you with an ad after a week- but fortunately the ad (appears as a text at the top of your conversations list) is neither obstructive more obnoxious. Great customization features and in my opinion, very intuitive and reliable!",4
com.textra,A Google user,I'm looking for a killer feature. Fast switching to bulk SMS from within compose screen. I like being able to auto save pictures and delete older texts over a certain count (I also backup my texts and calls using SMS backup so if there's something I need later it's in a cloud drive),4
com.textra,A Google user,"I hated the text app that came installed on my phone so I replaced it with Textra and have never been sorry. Yes, it has ads and occasionally I accidentally tap an ad instead of the text I want but that's hardly a big problem. Very satisfied overall.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I was skeptical of a messaging app with ads. But after using tetra I love it. The ad position is movable which is great. And honestly paying for the ad free version is really not that much. I have downloaded textra to each new phone and I will continue to use it! Awesome message app!!!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Nice clean UI and it's nice being able to either alter the colour scheme for all conversations, or to customize the colours for each conversation. Works well with my contacts and phone apps, and is nice and uncluttered and doesn't have loads of features that aren't necessary.",5
com.textra,Charles Crook,Been using the paid version for years and really like it due to the customization it offers. But been having duplicate issues with Android auto.

com.textra,A Google user,"I've been trying different SMS apps to replace the App I have been using that is more basic. I really like Textra, but wish it had the pop up on lock screen like ChompSMS. Been using ChompSMS and really like it but moving back to Textra for now as Chomp has been slow and constantly shows a message badge when I do not have any unread messages and will not play video's. Still in search for the perfect SMS app or maybe Textra will update with a better notification pop up. That's my hope.",3
com.textra,A Google user,I am really enjoying this app. I love the different colors for various contacts. I really like the option of having a dark background screen to save energy and to deter onlookers from actually seeing my text. This is a great app.,5
com.textra,James Clay,"Love this messaging App. Only problem lately, no sound with my notifications. Vibrate and message okay, just no chirp sound to tell me via audio. I've checked all settings not sure why no sound. I even changed my default app to another message service and when I send a message it chirps the sound no problem but when I switch back to Textra it's again vibrate only no sound.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I've had a great experience using Textra! I love how clean and easy it is to use and the customization per contact is nice. Upgraded to the Pro version because it has been so great. I'm hoping they'll announce updates for RCS soon! That would be a game changer.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Not going lie i love textra, but i have lost clients because of this app. I dont get my messages, people are not receiving my messages . Its frustrating.

Fix the bugs and i will come back.",1
com.textra,L. Nick,My only suggestion is for an auto response feature. Verizon had one for when you were driving that could be turned on. That's pretty sophisticated though. I'd be thrilled to be able to set an auto responder up for contacts. Love this app!!,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been looking for an app under Android that lets me block all group messaging, many of them let you shut off notifications but you still have to look at them, this app helps me to Black list them where I don't even need to see them so it's awesome, you can blacklist anyone or a whole group and never have to even see them on your phone, forcing people to text you individually and killing the social media aspect of text messaging which is worth gold.",5
com.textra,michael braxton,"With the free app, I was able to insert a line or paragraph break at any time using keyboard. Since upgrading to pro version, I cannot insert line or paragraph breaks. The app inserts breaks on its own. What a letdown.",3
com.textra,jon cash,"Lots of customization, not overly complicated, frequently updated. Why haven't you downloaded?",5

I need a reliable texting service and, unfortunately, this isnt it anymore.",2
com.textra,A Google user,This app looks great except it doesn't have a way to easily change font size by either pinching or volume buttons etc. That's a deal-breaker for me since I don't want to have to put on my reading glasses to read a text.,2
com.textra,A Google user,I really like this app. I love all the colors and additional emojis you get with Textra. I still can't get notification sounds on my S7 edge that lets me know I am receiving a text. This means I am constantly checking my phone which I HATE! I don't know if this has to do with my carrier Pure Talk (ATT) or not.,3
com.textra,Jacklyn Smith,This app is a great. I have the pro version. It's reliable and easy to use. It's also simple but you also get to customize things the way that you like them. as well as if you have any issues or problems you can text and they quickly answer back and help you with any problems that you have.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I like the Textra but I would like to have a choice between all possible colors of bubbles, of text and background (16 millions colors?). Is it possible to add? Especially I'm missing darker colors and colors of text. Everything's too light even in night mode. Thank you in advance.",4
com.textra,Mike Roberts,It's missing the ability to easily share files that are not images. You have to find what you want to share first and then click share via Textra whereas other apps typically just have a attach file option and can then search your phone for what you want to share.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I found this one after struggling with handcent sms with certain things, and after this recent update I can't even send or receive mms messages. Sadly had to drop it and move back to handcent. I'm aware you guys were forced by Google to make these changes in some way, but I can't say that fixes or even makes up for the issue.",2
com.textra,SURESH D'SOUZA,"Works excellently. Suits all my requirements. Most what I wanted was the delivery reports & the message badge counter. Both are working well. Another plus point is that there is a one time payment for the permanent ad free app, unlike other apps where you have to pay a subscription every month ! Thank you Textra.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"The system is definitely better than the standard Android one. Being able to paint the colors for users helps to determine work, friends, family, etc, and the programmed delay to send allows you to glance the message prior to sending helping catch errors. Good stuff Mainard!",5
com.textra,A Google user,love this app with my Samsung galaxy. very customizable and even allows you to convert incoming MMS messages to SMS so they don't get broken up into a bunch of messages. you can change all colors as well as text bubbles. you can also use the GIF options and different emoji interfaces. you'll love it!,5
com.textra,A Google user,Very impressed with all the feature. Send location is the only one I was missing. Used it in Message + Also at some point syncing messages with other devices. But really nice. How can I just pay in advance to avoid ever seeing an ad.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is the most fun & easy text app Ive found for LG G7. The ads on the free version werent annoying at all but upgrading to the Pro version was so inexpensive it was well worth it. No overabundance of tedious instructions or options to go thru, fun color customization & notification sounds. So easy even your Grands would love it.",5
com.textra,Robert Guthrie,"A beautifully designed, highly functional app that is very user-friendly and easy to learn. After the non-ad trial period, consider purchasing the pro edition which will eliminate ads. It is fairly priced.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app! Love the color customization, it's clean and works seemlessly. I've used others with all the colorful themes, but it was always too busy with pictures and graphics This one is colorful, yet clean. thank you for a great alternative to the stock messenging app!",5
com.textra,Rayed Kury,"So far I'm loving this text app. Even though there are ads, they are none abstrusive. The benefits outweigh them. I like the customization options with colors and the very accurate time stamps. I recommend trying it. 🤗",5
com.textra,Kirsten Kay,I can't get photos to send at all. Other than that I like it so far. Supposedly have a response. Can't see it yet. I'm hoping I fixed it!,4
com.textra,D C,"Great app! The incredible customer service is even better! Textra allows me to receive great looking images, which I could not receive thru the messaging app that Google had on my Jelly 2 phone. Textra is so simple looking yet so customizable that I have been able to get it exactly the way I want it, which is so pleasing. As I mentioned, the customer service is amazing! I rarely reach out for help on an app, but I did on this one & I received kind and accurate help well within a day! Thank you!",5
com.textra,Rob Tait,"Worse than useless. It demands default sms rights. Won't ever happen with any ad supported muggleware. Lasted as long as it took to add this warning to everyone. Uninstalled. EDIT. If it were true that since kitkat exclusive rights were required the app I use would not work. This seems like trying to take control. Only developer can sort this. Advice to readers. Don't install until this is fixed. EDIT. I suggest you contact Google and get it fixed, then I will be quite happy to review again.",1
com.textra,Jon Pham,"Wow, they finally added the ability to send to a recent conversation group. Bumped up to 4 stars. Now only that is missing is ability to message from the web. Google messages has this and it's definitely a stand out feature that makes it competitive with imessage",4
com.textra,A Google user,I noticed that the battery life on my Note was less desirable lately so i looked into why that might be. By using GSAM and Wakelock detector  I quickly realized that my Google Messages app was creating thousands of wakelocks daily! i would lose 15-20% just sitting idle overnight. I switched to textra and the results are like night and day. Works great and doesn't suck - battery.,5
com.textra,Seif Eddine B,"The app is great, nice design and useful features. Watchout for aggressive battery saving settings, as it will close Textra and you will not receive any sms messages (OTP, bank statements, purchases etc) unless you manually open the app and wait for the sms. For a Poco F3, you must activate AUTO START in permissions. I recommend the dev to ask users to make sure this toggle is ON for Xiaomi/Poco phones on MiUI 13.",4
com.textra,K Phelps,So much better than the default texting app on my phone! Looks nicer and has more utility. I especially love being able to schedule a text to send later. They also have very prompt helpful customer service when you have a question.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I used to love this app. It has a lovely appearance and seems to help block most spam messages. UPDATE: NOW it keeps closing on me! I really did try. UPDATE: It somehow got sorted out and is working again. I kudos to Jason and the great support I got from the company. 3/14/20 UPDATE: still going strong. I sometimes need to reinstall, but not very often. I need to with all my apps. This app behaves better than most.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"pretty good app. the ads are sometimes a pain. it does act weird at times, can't read the texts at times because they are hidden by the bar you are typing in, maybe a fix is coming???? they said to check my notifications. i don't see any message from textra??????????",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I have Google message for years and now it has too many glitches.... GIF not downloading, took forever for msm to send. sometime msm gets send over an hour. That's just ridiculous. So I had enough and download about 4 different texting apps to my phone. After a few hours deciding which one is the best...I choose Textra. it gives sooooo much control and i love the little robot that i can text ""tip"" to. it's clean, fast, all my gifs, gallery, videos in 1 spot. thank you for existing",5
com.textra,iron “SUPERfireMAN” lion,Love the ability to customize everything. Runs smooth and clean. Add more updated emojis and stickers....(UPDATED 03/12/2021) the new features are keeping this a no brainer if you are looking for complete control over your texting and chat experience hands down....only issue now is completing with the like feature imessage has on apple conquer that and its easily 10 star app.,4
com.textra,Connie Harvey,"Text messages are often not sent. So I requested receipt via your settings. Sometimes it sends a receipt and sometimes it doesn't! As with the messages, sometimes sent, sometimes not. Probably need to change to another app. I only installed for the lock feature.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Nice change for a text app. 12-13-18 I must say after paying for this app I have mixed emotions about the new update you guys took away the option to change the color of text icon for contacts or in general I like the new icons but I wish it still had the color choice still available. I also wish you could add a background image for some contacts just a thought.,5
com.textra,A Google user,I downloaded Textra SMS a couple of days ago and I really like it. It's very customizable and certainly more attractive than the default messaging app. I submitted a question to the development team and Mandy responded later the same day with relevant instructions. Cool! I recommend it.,4
com.textra,Michelle Mason,"Well, that was useless. SMS msgs delivery was spotty. Some wwnt through easily. Others wouldn't go even after multiple tries, includong one that was a mere 6 characters! There were no emojis to be found anywhere either. Read the bad reviews before downloading but there were so many good reviews I thought I'd give it a shot.",1
com.textra,A Google user,I really like this app and it's been my go-to for texting for a while.  Did the recent update remove the ability to change the colors of the icon on the notification bar?  I used to assign colors to certain people and can't seem to find that feature any longer.,4
com.textra,Michaela O'Malley,"Needs work. Got it bcz gboard & LG G6 one both suck now. Has some things going for it (colors, no ads on mine?) but 1. Still uses the native keyboard. Can't change color of board to match dark theme, which i need because eye strain. 2. Idk if it's textra or lg but the prediction & correction suggestions are weak. Don't even work at all in pop up mode or some apps, like play store... ALL the typos. 3. Cant search a thread for a keyword. Why? 4. Gifs are just meh",4
com.textra,Leo Moore,"Keeps removing Textra icon from home screen dock every time the launcher refreshes/restarts. I love this launcher, but having to re-add an icon to the dock that I use literally ALL THE TIME is kind of annoying. And Textra is the only messaging app I use and I'm a pro user for it so I don't plan on replacing it. Please fix and will raise rating back to five stars.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Totally great and amazingly customizable. You can even customize where to see the very small ad. Works great, never crashes, and the support team is very responsive, friendly and attentive! Great for my Pixel 2. Keep it up!!",5

I went thru the update recommended, and today got again a failed sent message notification. Will get back to the default app. STAY away from this app",1
com.textra,Chad LeDoux (Chad),"Been using Textra Pro for years and have tried others but always come back to Textra. Got the most features, cleanest interface. Had only one issue sending videos but after a quick google search I got it resolved. Have to say though they are quick to respond to any issues you may have..",5
com.textra,A Google user,The app is very good. the only problem I have is I already make it as an messaging default app but the permision usage monitor keep appering even though I already allow the app.. Can you solve this? and another thing.. is good that we just swip a buble to view the time stamps but maybe it is still much better if you can just make it apper below the message like if you enable the delivery/sent notice..,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I honestly downloaded Textra because it gave my aburrido stock messaging app a ""hot look."" I LOVE the colors, especially that you can change color of the ICON, text BUBBLES, LETTERS+ timed texts OMG. You can tell these creators really thought this through. For peeps like me who love colors especially because the color options have different shades, it's super great! ❗❗Pls add more colors & where you can reply to a specific text or pic! Or to a specific person in group chat!!❗❗Thank you Textra!😇",4

com.textra,A Google user,"Not delivering messages. My boyfriend and I both use this app on newer Samsung devices. It happens every other day that messages don't get delivered or get delayed by sometimes thirty minutes, which causes massive miscommunication and arguments. Other messaging apps do not do this. Figure it out.",1
com.textra,Corbin McIsaac,"Been using this SMS app for 2 years and I absolutely love it! The appearance of the app is EXTREMELY customizable! They have a MASSIVE amount of colour shades to pick from and you can give contacts their own colour theme for their conversation, customize the bubbles shape/colour, font, text colours, theme colour, accent colour, basically EVERYTHING Even the apps icon and notification icon colour and choose what the notification icon looks like! Plus you can control a ton of options! BEST SMS APP",5

com.textra,A Google user,"Pretty wonderful texting app. LOVE customizing the vibration pattern and scheduling messages, however I've moved to Android Messages by Google until Textra adds RCS features. Though I do have to switch back and forth when scheduling a message. I'll come back full time once RCS is available.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using Textra for a few years now. I go out of my way to buy phones that run stock, or nearly stock, Android. If Google makes an app, I'll usually use it over a third party offering, but even with the new updates to Google's Messenger, Textra is still, in my opinion, the better option. Textra is one of the few third party apps I add to all my devices. Textra has worked, without fail, for the entire time I've used it, the options it provides for personalization allow you to really make it your own, and the built in Giphy support works better than all the other messaging apps I've used.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"This is sooo much nicer than the stock app that came with the phone. The stock app converted long texts to MMS, for which my provider charges. That's why I installed Textra - I got irritated with my stupid old messaging app. This app also has a lot of other clever and pretty customisations for the user to choose. And the adverts are really unobtrusive.",5

com.textra,Robert Mendes,"So, I really love this app and the ability it provides for customization. I was initially put off by a request to upgrade that didn't make clear to me that it was just a one time 4 dollar and change charge. The app manager made it clear to me, I coughed up the $ and I am happy I did.",4
com.textra,Tim Masters,"I like the Textra app a lot. It has lots of features and customizations. I really wish they would come out with an app for Galaxy Watch though.

com.textra,A Google user,Was looking for texting app to replace default app. Found textra on a few reviews and tried it out. It is as good as the reviews say and haven't gone to look at the others!

Therefore, currently this app is unusable for me. Please advise?",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Almost all good. Weirdly, about 3 people who text me don't ever show up on textra, but only on the native messaging app. Frustrating. They don't seem to have anything in common. It must be a setting on my end, but I can't figure it out.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Really love the app, but unfortunately with the new Samsung upgrade on my s9+ it's not working well, can't delete messages, a lot of crashing.

com.textra,Yeni Curtis,"I like the customization, but I wish the notification message could stay longer on the screen or until action is taken, right now, it only appears for a couple of seconds and then is gone, and more customizable notification window... Such bigger message screen, a separation between the name of the sender and the message.",3
com.textra,A Google user,I've been using this app for years now. Every time I upgrade my phone this is one of the first apps I make sure i grab to install on it. I like the dark mode best and having more options on how I want my messages displayed is a big deal. If you're a iPhone convert like my wife you can set it up to mimick their display. Overall its been great an it gets updated regularly.,5

com.textra,A Google user,"This app has come a long way since I bought it in 2014. I really love the customization and, especially, the sending animation. Well done! It has earned 5 stars from me.

Again, this is just a suggestion, not a complaint. 5 stars all around!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using for well over a year. Works great. They update on a regular basis and continue to improve. I use the paid version, so no ads. My wife uses the free version ad does not complain about ads. (They bothered me.) Great for texting groups.",5

If problem continues I will have to uninstall the app. I have also emailed textra SMS",2
com.textra,Faset ***,I completely agree with Kimosh Mosh. I also have been happy with this texting app overall for years until recently when out of the blue the notifications stopped working. What used to be a 5 star app has gone down to a 3. I hope you can fix the problem and return to the 5 star program I know you to be! I hate advertising in general and would like the option of paying a few $$ a month to not have to see them.,3

That's the only gripe I have with Textra, can we fix this??",3
com.textra,A Google user,Best messaging app to date! More customizations than you need! Textra has taken all of the headaches from other messaging apps and changed them and enhanced great messaging app features other apps have. And the customer support about anything is superb. Won't bother to search other messaging apps. BEST PART? They don't ask you for permission into any of your info. Apps are the best way to get hacked. Textra didn't ask for the need for any of my info. Brilliant!,5

com.textra,A Google user,"Very happy with Textra. I like the ability to be able to change the text size, customize the background color ect which my stock app did not offer. I upgraded to the prime version for a one time small fee after a week of using it to eliminate ad's and I'm glad I did.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This app is great! Have you ever been added to a group messaging without your consent? You sure did find it difficult to opt out. With Textra SMS, you just right click and blacklist the group. As simple as that. I highly recommend this app.",5

And apparently, I wasn't receiving her text messages as well. So I changed the default texting app to the pre-installed app on my Samsung S8+ and voila -- problem solved...",2
com.textra,A Google user,"This app has very good features. I, especially, love its customizable features. Wonderful rich featured app & fantastic support. For these reasons, I love Textra. But, its blocking is limited to numbers. Spammers use revolving numbers. I've installed and defaulted another messaging app with more aggressive blocking options. Sorry, Textra. I really hate to say goodbye 😔",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I have been using Textra for many years and overall it is a good app. However MMS is a real Pain - there is definitely something wrong. Other apps send and receive MMS fine for example the built in Xiaomi Messaging app, but not Textra. It works sometimes but mostly not. Weird. Support has not been helpful at all on this. Android 5.1 Xiaomi Note 3",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Love the customizable tones for contacts sms and mms. Am currently looking to change however because I need dual sim sms settings, if Textra would put in a option to keep sms/mms conversations separate in respect to dual sims that would be great! 4 example if my friend sms/mms's sim 1 it goes into a different conversation than if the same friend sms/mms's sim 2. This is why I (and lots of others - do a Google search) have a dual sim phone. We want the convenience of 2 phones in the one handset",4
com.textra,A Google user,"So far, so good. I downloaded this because I couldn't select some messages to delete from my default Google Messages app. It was either delete a conversation, or one message at a time. This app is fast, and has great functionality.",5

I love the swipe and double click on trash delete but it has so much more than this little list. I try other message programs but I always come back to Textra. Try it. You will love it!!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"It is good application. On delivery of sms should have also an option of pop up or sound for sms delivery.

com.textra,A Google user,"This app has a lot of customizing features, however it seems to not always notify you of a text.

com.textra,A Google user,"It's a great versatile messenger app. The truth is, as other standard apps or third party apps play catch up, I'm not interested in finding out. This was an innovative app and I trust it will continue to develop more user friendly options ahead of the curve.",5

Nobody likes the stupid counting badges! I'm only here because Chomp SMS doesn't use GIFs anymore!,1

I picked this one because the reviews were pretty great and I could customize the look to something I wanted. I didn't care that it had a feature that allowed me to send messages at a future time and date, but that has turned out to be one of my favorite things about this app. I ended up loving this app so much that I kept it and continue using it on my new phone. 10/10, would recommend.",5

com.textra,Michael Skurka,"Had a problem with sending MMS. No pictures would send. Just the flashing indicator. Textra support was *quick* to respond. Uninstall and reinstall, and switching to disable Wi-Fi sending seems to have fixed the issue. Back to being the best SMS app. Yay!",5
com.textra,Rowan Clarke,"It's a great app and easy to download a conversation to email. I really like the up to 9 seconds delay before sending a message, gives you a second chance🥴. Also the ads are very inconspicuous, but I think I will get the paid version just to say thanks.",5
com.textra,Michele Little,"I loved this app until the recent update. During a call the phone only vibrates (no sound notification)when you have an incoming text message. For that reason, I had to uninstall and find another messaging app. Other than that, the app is great!",3
com.textra,Peter Hubbard,I do like this app but I wish it were possible to set a time to send the sms to avoid annoying friends in a different time zone by texting them a 3 in the morning. The developer got back to me very quickly with clear instructions on how to schedule text messages.,5
com.textra,G T,I have dyslexia and visual disability so seeing a lot of things on screen is not easy for me. Textra allows me to adjust my background colours and more and that way its so much easier for me to use. I love it as no other text app does this as good as textra. 5star rating for me.,5
com.textra,Tysha Ward,I love this app it's one of my favorites it's very customizable I can change up my colors for my messages and Have different message icons.

This is what every app should be like. Thank you!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app totally customizable....features that i haven't seen in many other messaging apps, such as scheduled texts.

com.textra,Scott Ishiyama,"I've used this app for years. It was ahead of its time, and although Android Messages has added many of Textra's features, I still find Textra easier to use and more intuitive. I've tried switching to Messages on Android 11 but still return to Textra each time.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I will give 5 stats because I believe this app to be the best alternative to the stock app. The only request is for using a message portal like stock Google now has. I used push bullet and mighty text in the past and had issues with tons of things plus sync times etc. Google's ""messages for web"" just.....works and I know they have more hooks into the os but hopefully Textra can have its own portal and cloud sync. Is it in the works?",5

It's only 4/5 though, because it's 2021 and it's still compressing the hell out of all my incoming videos. Great app otherwise but I'd imagine there's be a fix for this somewhere in there.",4
com.textra,Anthony Backmon,Nothing but a positive experience since I first bought the app 5 years ago. I was wondering have you guys changed the camera features. Before I would take a selfie and the picture would flip automatically to look correctly It doesn't do that anymore. All in all I'll still give you guys five stars! I have no problems with the app ever!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Honestly, I've been using Textra for years and never really noticed it. For some reason, though, it is always the first thing I install on a new phone, and I never deal with whatever stock messager comes with the phone.

com.textra,Objectivité,Still lacks the ability to have an edit box take 2/3rds of the screen. I desperately want to use Textra SMS but keep having to go back to Next SMS because a request I have put in 5 times still has not been implemented. Textra still does not understand that there are many business people who REGULARLY send long texts and that the optional ability to have an edit window that takes two thirds of the screen is critical for them. 1 ckick in Next SMS gives you that. Will Textra listen at last ?,3
com.textra,Jim Reece,"I like Textra SMS, but it has no tools to filter out SPAM text messages. That has become a huge problem. It does have the ability to block a number, but today that is far less than needed today. The features that it has and ease of use is very good. It just needs SPAM filter tools.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Only one thing... I think that the app itself is flawless and I love the customization options. what i widh voild be show is the time stamp underneath like in iMessage or Android Messages and I think Samsung has it as well.

Customization all over the place, you can blocklist people and still be able to view and reply while they are blocklisted, mute certain people, use chat bubbles if you'd like, choose the action you want to take when you click a link in a message, search a message string by date, iMessage reactions work with this app. Just download it and get the premium. You'll never look back.",5
com.textra,Steve Hursh,This is the most convenient and customizable SMS app. I particularly like that the composition bubble expands with your message so you read the entire text without scrolling. This helps to avoid mistakes in a long message.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I decided to use textra because my Samsung stock SMS app sorted ineffectively and had other quirks. Each of the 3rd party sms apps I've tried are missing a feature or miss the mark with organizing threads. Textra is clear and easy. Adding multiple people as a group is clunky using a + button. It would be better just to click ""name"" pane for each additional recipient.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I absolutely Love this app! There are so many features you are able to customize, the word suggestion is so good that I sometimes wonder if it can read my mind (lol) and the ads are so unobtrusive I forget they're even there.

App works great specialy for sending high res photos,5
com.textra,A Google user,I love this app . It has different sizes and shapes of the conversation bubbles as well as you can have a different color for every. There are ads but they appear at the top of the page instead of interrupting your texting.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I wish I could give this app a higher rating but it does not go far enough to help block spam texts. It only allows you to block a number that has already sent a text. There is no customization to blocking. Being able to block by area code or prefix would be a great feature to add, many other texting apps have this feature.  I am starting to regret paying for this app.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"The way that textra handles mms timeouts is soooo obnoxious. I know that receiving an mms is dependent on the carrier. But other messenger services give me the option to reattempt downloading. Textra will try to re-download after 30 minutes and if it doesnt get it, it will only retry every 12 hours. I've had pictures that I received a whole day after they were sent. I had service all throughout the day. So why won't textra allow me to get it sooner instead of puttering around?",2
com.textra,A Google user,"I have come back to Textra after an affair with BlackBerry (Passport), ending in a slow miserable death march. Google Messages is nice but I have decided to stay away. So many Google projects have been cast away, like Google Plus, Allo, Hangouts (still alive, sort of), merely vehicles for harvesting private info, I guess. Google people are merely playing around. A simple beautiful SMS is what I want. Textra is it. I am a pro user, I am pleasantly surprised. Nice of them to remember me.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Why did you remove the customer logo notification color?? Whole purpose of personalization gone. I used to be able to see the color of the notification icon and I knew who or what group it was without going further etc. Very sad. Looking for another app now I saw the prompt reply and I understand. I bumped it up to 4 star but still not 5 because it hasn't given the complete personalization and custom notifications like before which made it the better of all apps. Thanks for the reply and it is unfortunate that they made Textra downgrade.... terrible move on their part,4
com.textra,Jana Otis,I have been using this app for years now and I am a pro user. I love the way this app is so customizable to each person’s preferences. The support team is great and answers questions quickly. It’s easy to use. Thank you to the developers for constantly improving and updating the app! I recommend this app to anyone who wants more from their texting application than the basics.,5

I've had to delete Textra off of my phone many times and put it back on because it will just randomly stop working- EVEN the paid version I had did that and so I lost my paid for version.

com.textra,aman agrawal,"Grt experience with app so far. Just a small suggestion if u can implement, kindly add customisation for text color in circle which is shown at left side of each thread (the initial letter of each contact/sender). That will look so cool with full black theme with text colors like yellow, red & other colors. If u will do that will instantly give 5 star as u deserves that.",4
com.textra,Mark Erickson,"When I up graded my phone from a Samsung Galaxy S9 to a Galaxy S21 fe, I lost notifications from Textra (4.49).

com.textra,Roy Lomax,"Over previous years I've occasionally tried other messaging apps, but always kept Textra on the phone, but after an extremely short period of time, I was back with Textra. I've always said that it's the best, and I feel like a parrot when I say ""it's the BEST"".",5
com.textra,Radu Cezar Popescu,I have to say I rarely review apps but I really love this Textra App. All the customization options really make the all phenomenal and it's really stable. Good job to the devs!!✌️ Maybe some features that would be cool to add: - ability View People's only first name in text messages. - customize send message sound effect,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I really love how customizable textra is and how aesthetically pleasing it looks. unfortunately, because I can't archive messages, i will have to uninstall. When this feature is added in the future if it is, I will definitely go back to Textra.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"This is one of my favorite applications, I've been using it for years. I'm also happy I helped support them with the Pro edition, I'd honestly buy it again! The updates keep coming and whenever I notice something they fix it, like the recent Android Vibrate update they pushed. These people are on top of it, thanks for the great work!",5
com.textra,Peter Jennings,"Love the app.. thanks for the recent update, and the ability to like comments. Question, will we have the ability to like a photo? Thanks again.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Great texting app. Supports multiple keyboards. Color code conversations. Pin conversations. Delay sending texts to ensure you don't have a typo. Cool features. One thing they are missing is the ability to add a recipient to an existing text thread.,5
com.textra,Elusive Ellie,"Great app, have used it for years. Very customizable, and the developers obviously care about feedback. Just look how often they respond to reviews, and how they allowed the legacy icon as a choice as soon as people complained! Their patch notes are also always detailed, some apps don't tell you what was changed but they make sure you can find out, even long after the patch was pushed. Good job, guys.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I found the app rather cumbersome.  I tried to delete a single message and ended up loosing ghe entire conversation thread.  I couldn;t find any way to recover and lost valuable information.  I did like some of the customizable features.  Support  is really poor.,3
com.textra,A Google user,ADS ADS ADS WORSE PAID FOR PRO. pls contact me to fix this. love the texting itself but the Ads are going off every couple minutes. worse once I paid for pro to get rid of them!! why!!!!?? UPDATE *** Emailed w screenshot. please take a look and help asap. 😫 I do like this texting app over android and IOS. however if the ads don't go away I would like a refund and ill even delete my review. I'm hoping I don't have to.,1
com.textra,A Google user,"I have been using Textra for a few years and definitely love all the features. I upgraded to premium almost right away because i am so hapoy with the app. love being able to customize notification, contacts, colors and so much more. I also really likebeing able to schedule text messages. If you're not hapoy with your stock alp then I highly recommend this one.",5
com.textra,A Google user,This app is meh at best. It's customizable but after about 10 days it will start showing ads at the top of your messages. Not worth it. In addition my pictures messages sending or receiving to iPhones weren't always going through. Download something else.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using Textra since 2017. New job, new phone, the stock text app justing was not cutting it. Textra gets the job done well and keeps getting better.

com.textra,Kristina,"Update did the trick! Thank you again Textra CS! Updated my review to reflect how well this app works & how responsive cs is. I turned to Textra several years ago when there was no way to adjust colors for the messaging app that came with my phone. Dealing with chronic migraines and seizures this app truly helped me continue to stay in touch with my friends and family simply because of colors! Textra, THANK YOU!",5
com.textra,Natalie Meyer (People Get Healthy),"I have loved this app exclusively for some time, but I have one complaint (and I submitted a review on the other app I mention below as well): for some reason when Textra is my default SMS, some of my rec'd texts (only) delay sometimes as much as 24 hrs in TEXTRA, but NO delays if Google msgs default SMS (I use for work on web). Their app doesn't have ability to silence a thread or I would switch. And ur app doesn't have the ability to use on the web or I would dump Google msgs. Help?",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Pretty good app. There double tap after swipe to delete should be changeable. It defeats the purpose of a fast action when you have to confirm it. Just swipe to delete, no extra actions. And I can't find an area to change the swipe actions.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Was looking for an app to replace the xiaomi system messaging app. I tried for a couple of months to use Google messages application but because of system restrictions it could not function as the default messages application without rooting my phone... Thank God I found this app because it works great as my default messaging app with plenty of customisation options.,5
com.textra,Kelly Madison,2022 UPDATE: after all these years it's STILL not possible to send any file over Textra. I have to switch to another text messaging app to send files. 2020 Update: I can't believe there still is NO WAY TO ATTACH A FILE (like pdf or other file)!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! The stupid + icon (instead of paperclip) allows you only to use emoticons or pictures. NO FILES!!!,1
com.textra,A Google user,I've been using Textra for a long time. I always recommend it because it is simple and easy to use. But now I am encountering a problem with my quick reply. My settings is not to close app after sending but it keeps on closing whenever I reply.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra had been great up until update 4.17 which broke the Mute functionality. Despite sharing feedback directly and 3 additional updates since, the Mute functionality appears to still be broken. Overall, Textra is a good app, but does not add much more compared to the stock Messenger application when it's Mute function does not work, outside of a Send delay feature.",3
com.textra,Trystan J,"Has been great up until recently - media handling has gotten unstable. Sending photos is almost impossible, the app freezes while trying to process the added photo. I have to force close, add the photo, wait up to 30s and then maybe it'll go. Would love for this to hey resolved!",4
com.textra,DJ Raspberry,"Amazing messaging app. So many customization options! Minimal ads; they're hardly ever in the way. I like the custom notification preview, but it's a lot less responsive and easy to use than the default Android notification preview.",5
com.textra,CatMomAmadeo,I really like the Textra app. I love being able to blocklist spammers. I hate those guys... 6/29/21 Having issues with the app AGAIN. Used to be able to send long msgs & MMS--now the app gets hung up & won't send the msg. I shortened the msg & broke it up into smaller sections & now it will send it. But folks hate getting multiple msgs. Set the app to send longer msgs as MMS. Still issues w/MMS pix. I have unlimited SMS & MMS so that can't be it. If I uninstall/reinstall block'd retrn back.,3
com.textra,Eve Scott,"Easy and has a lot of convenient features. I wish there was a ""schedule text"" option. But, other than that-no issues or complaints. UPDATE: So apparently, you can schedule text!! Yaaaay! This is definitely an app I'm KEEPING!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I like textra, but it is not without its glitches. I have the paid version. I like that it can be personalized for colors, fonts and sounds, but one of the glitches is that when I restart my phone the textra app disappears from my home screen. (I have read that when one changes the color of the app, you may have this problem. I want a different app color to keep it from blending in with my screen color.) Also, I have some text that don't appear, but they do in my stock app.",3
com.textra,A Google user,so far it's pretty good the only problem I've been having is that the time date stamp you can't adjust that size or color and sometimes it makes it very hard to read it well overall good app colors can pass be used in other combinations but good selection anyways I could probably use some more bubble sizes too but that's each their own so I gave it four out of five stars,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Why can't you put camera icon to take pictures ready. Don't want to use collections that look thumb tack. I like the idea ChompSMS already have likt text and take pictures and sent. It's frustrating of your design we dislike it. I see the plus but did not recognize instead of plus icon how about 📂 icon look better than ➕. Still more work to need visual icon. However, adding one more star up. And now just purchase your app to remove ads. SO far I believe you are getting better. Thank you 😁",4
com.textra,Michael Mage,At first I was ok with Textra and it's relatively easy format with custom options galore for the most part. But now the advertising Textra allows has become overwhelming and more than annoying. I have over 150 blocklisted numbers now with zero effect and receive more advertising texts than from friends and family. I'm very disappointed and ready to try something else.,2
com.textra,Tobiloba Oyeyemi,The app is beautiful but it's not receiving some incoming SMS and j miss important stuffs. Kindly rectify this ASAP.,2
com.textra,A Google user,It's fantastic i have one request put blacklist unblacklist switch on info panel of messages. Let the user configure the choice to hide or unhide the list of older messages from blacklisted people in the messages list e.g give them the choice to show or not show that person in the list of names on the opening screen Maybe mark that person as blocked on the opening never ever delete those messages unless confirmed by the user. Create a separate menu item in settings to adjust those options,5
com.textra,A Google user,It's a great texting app. Better then Handsent. Easy to use and set up and not complicated. I think I'll continue to use for a while. Handsent just got to complicated and to detailed to use and I had that app for over 5 years. It started out simple but later became difficult to use over time. Keep up the good work and keep it simple.,5
com.textra,Cookie Schuerg,I love textra...been using it for around 4 yrs now and have never considered changing. Lots of options and personalizations. I submitted a message the other day and heard back from someone right away. They are always updating and keeping things fresh. Highly recommend!!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"This app needs an option to where I can change notifications to my own notifications, like songs so I can identify whose calling me.

com.textra,rubber duky (fade2black),"100% amazing....very customisable. Very fun to use. Okay so now after having textra for over a year, it's still going strong, never had any issues, and still a lot of fun to use. Gifs are plentiful and insert with no problems as well. Full steam ahead devs.",5
com.textra,Aj NJie,"One of the best texting apps you could use in my opinion, the various themes and settinga really let you personalize it, and the interface is really simple for anyone to use. As soon as I get a new phone, this is the one of the first apps I make sure to redownload",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app! Does everything I need except marking messages as unread. Functions well, super customizable. I wish there were more fonts though! Customizations include individual conversation customization, vibrate pattern, colors, text size, pop up notification etc. I love it!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I started using this app because the text messaging app the comes built into the phone started malfunctioning. This is a good text app. The only downfall to it is that you cant send videos through the app from the vidoes saved on your phone. You will have to send them by creating a video on the textra app,5
com.textra,chai pi,This one is the best text app for me. It would be greate if then can add separation of notice messages ang personal messages. Also if they can automatically identify spam text message like google messages.,5
com.textra,Mike U,"Been using this app for years. Absolutely love it! Love that I can customize everything! Font, text bubble style, colors, contact notifications and ringtones.

com.textra,A Google user,"I really like Textra, it's simple to use and has an attractive design. For only $2.18/year (a pretty reasonable price), I was given the option to remove all advertising. I would recommend Textra to anyone interested in improving their texting experience.",4

Unbeknownst to me, by downloading this, I activated a 14 Day Trial, which is now over, and which ADS now appear as messages.

com.textra,A Google user,"the features on this app are nearly perfect. The only thing that I would love to see added is the ability to block messages that contain keywords which I can define. with spammers faking different phone numbers with each message, simply blocking a number doesn't stop the spam.",5
com.textra,Trist L,Great app. Altho it just hangs when trying to send small video clips over text to friends. Aside from that... Love the color coding. No more accidentally sending a sext to a family member since I color code family and friends differently. Just needs to add custom wallpapers to make it perfect,4

com.textra,A Google user,Textra BOT is bugging me to rate it so here you are. If I was able to get rid of the emoji button forever which I often hit by mistake I would bump it up a couple notches. I hate getting annoying emoji in my messages and will never send one. Update:had email discussions with Textra help about removing imoji and gifs from the toolbar. They reviewed this and can't fix it right now but are sending to the developers for review of adding customizing option to the tool bar. Im adding a star for trying,3

I was toggling each individual chat to notification on, but when I went to the list of messages it showed each chat was muted. I couldn't understand why as I'd just turned each on individually. Finally I long pressed on each chat and a window popped up saying ""unmute""!!! Why would you have a hidden mute/unmute action? So if you're experiencing this problem that's the answer.",4
com.textra,Tim Callahan,Love the app but wish that there was a paid version which avoided ads. The ads pop up at the top with just enough delay to ensure that I click them five or ten percent of the time. Would happily pay for an ad-free version of this otherwise excellent product.,4
com.textra,Jordan,Had a couple extremely important conversation get deleted randomly (no I didn't do it by accident and no no one else did it) with no way to recover it without fully restoring my phone and even still my last backup failed so i would be missing messages from the last week or two. This is very infuriating and I will probably not being using this sms app again because of it as I cannot have messages just go missing.,1
com.textra,Dan Maday,I use Textra all the time and it works. 2 days ago I was sent a bunch of pictures from a family event.i got. no notice from Textra. I looked at my settings.

com.textra,A Google user,"It's good with lots of user options, but hard to understand for someone not so competent in all the instructional terms. Not all of us had computer training in school. We had to learn as technology grew. That aside, I do like it alot.",4
com.textra,A Google user,This is really a fantastic app. Nearly Flawless and their tech support is outstanding. the only improvement I would recommend is the ability to backup & restore the threads. I do this with my Samsung Smartwatch app but a native function would be helpful.,5
com.textra,A Google user,App would have been good. UI was simple enough you could name group messages(which was reason i got it). though all would be good. problem is app mixes up who the messages are coming from and will miss label the sender. for example recieved message from chris but app said it was from Joe and put message in middle of conversation with joe. after deleting conversation an trying it again it would change outgoing contacts to random things. makes this app unusable to business and personal use,1
com.textra,A Google user,Default texting app on my Pixel started to act weird and wasn't sending messages. Looked around and found this app. Very pleased. Works like a charm. I like the customization options and like that I can set my own vibrate pattern and notification tone,5

com.textra,Joe C,Been using this app for several years. I just had to revert back to the default SMS app on my Pixel 2 because pictures stopped coming through. There were no solutions to this anywhere I could find. Perhaps the app doesn't work for older phones.,2

com.textra,A Google user,"Love the customizability and speed! It's my go-to SMS app now. The only minor quibble I have (and it could be my phone's fault, so I'm not taking off a star) is that my phone keeps warning me that Textra has been detected using SMS. Duh, that's what it's for. Great app, guys! Keep up the good work!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I love Textra! it's incredibly user friendly and looks great. I upgraded to Pro and when I got a new phone everything switched over with no issues. Before I found it I tried a bunch of custom keyboard options but none of them were what I needed. 15/10 would recommend!,5

I would love to know if that will be remedied soon or should I look for a messaging app that has color customization capability.

com.textra,A Google user,"Really like the app except for the flaw - cannot add or remove people to my group text i created. I need to add one person, and now i have to recreate the group to achieve this. Searching the web, this has been an issue for a good while - please fix this.",3
com.textra,Nicole S.,"Loved the app until the latest update. Now 95% of my texts fail to send despite having full bars on Wi-Fi network and 4G network. Great customer service....still not sure what the problem was, but it resolved itself after a few days.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I love the paid version so far. It's worth the $10. Pictures and videos are way easier to send through the app and come out cleaner than the regular text app. It's way more customizable and the emojis are actually better too. I love the features. Definitely worth it!!!,5
com.textra,Andrew Jimenez,Technical support was great. I had an issue where I couldn't send messages to a certain recipient. Contacted the IT team and they helped me with my issues. M Love this app. Think it's better than the standard Android or Samsung text messaging apps.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Great app been using for over 3 years now. They were the first with minimalistic look. Then android entire os copied with lollipop. 1 con is! There is no option to share to calendar. We can share emails to calendar in every day life which is awesome for productivity. So why not with textra. Yet to test back door application chatter. Will sniff ports later. We need more features,4
com.textra,Abhijit Sengupta,"This app is aweful in terms of message delivery and notification. My message was delivered after 13 hours and this is not the first time. For notification usually default notification is used. If I want to have some specific sound notification for a particular sender, I cannot have that now - I could have that in an earlier version. The setting has some specific number like 1 notification per day. That is nonsense - I would not be notified if I have 10 messages in a day?",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Great messaging app. I can say it's the best by far and trust me - I tried more than 40 apps. It has tons of customisation options, very intuitive, esay to use. And I noticed it's very light resource wise. Support team are really great guys, very helpful and responsive.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Im using this app for a while but there are times when I tried to send multiple text messages the last message stucked hence I cannot send another message so I need to go back to the main screen and compose that message again. I think its a kind of bug. Hope u can help me.,3
com.textra,Tammy Kleinow,"Its good other than this app won't let me save contacts. When I attempt to save any contact i get a pop up that says "" you have denied a permission"". I checked permissions in settings and all permissions are on. going to have to find another text app and uninstall this one. UPDATE CAN'T SEND A PIC. BEEN SITTING THERE FOR 2 HOURS. MY RECIPIENT WAS DEPENDING ON RECEIVING IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. NOT GOOD! GOING TO UNINSTALL . GEEEEZ, FIGURES! THANKS",1
com.textra,A Google user,Went back to Messages after using textra for about two years. it's not inherently bad but i can't deal with the ads. No real issues with it but i did notice it starting to slow down after time. Dev is responsive so no fault on that.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Easy to use and navigate! Has small banner ads at the top that isn't really in the way. You can set custom colors for different people, customize text chat bubble colors, set don't styles, and more! I love using this app and recommend 10/10!!🤯",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I like the app overall, but it seems kinda dated compared to the Google messaging app's sleek design on the messages. Maybe a couple new features could help the app a little. It might need a whole new makeover. I'll leave that up to the developers.",4
com.textra,Heather Cooper,"BEST TEXTING SYSTEM EVER!! This app apps you to schedule texts for the future, which is a lifesaver.. I have no issues with it and love the look and ease way better than the texting app which came with my Android. Great ability to customize notifications, colors, contacts and more.",5
com.textra,Per Ola Daulaire,"Great app. However, lately, neither my Pixel 4 5g nor my wife's iPhone 8 Plus play a recieved sound when we text each other, so these are missed. Opening our respective message apps, however, shows that the SMS/MMS text content has arrived at either end. Any thoughts as to why this sound blackout is happening, and is there a fix?",5
com.textra,Robert Ramin,"This is probably the most polished and regularly updated app on my phone. I really have nothing bad to say about it; it just does what it should do, and has more useful features and less bloat than any other SMS app that I've tried. They answered a question I posed to them within a couple hours. In my experience, app developers rarely, if ever, respond to support requests in a timely manner. I highly recommend this app!",5
com.textra,Clive Tyler,"Apologies for posting that this app has lost the option of customising the notification sound for individual contacts. After contact from the developer I have now been able to find out how to do this. In my defence, the way to do this has changed since I last used the facility. All is well again ☺️",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Ive used this app for probally 4 years, conjoined with Swiftkeys Keyboard. Since upgrading phones, my information that I was diligently correcting didn't transfer over. And most importantly, im now realizing that the issue I'm having with my MMS transfers are most likely due to this app. I've yet to find any API codes that work",3
com.textra,nick Mletzko,App itself is great. Lots of customizations. I've had various little issues since owning it (I paid for it) that weren't even the fault of textra itself (Google) but they've always replied within a day to my emails and assisted me in any way they could. Customer support is great,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Purchased full version months ago and all was working great until a week ago. now, in group chats I cannot see certain people's texts.

com.textra,A Google user,"i don't write a lot of reviews and only occasionally give a full 5 stars, so if you get a glowing review from me you truly have outdone yourself. All I can say is that is does what it's supposed to do, and does it better than the stock Google and LG messaging apps. The speed and ease of use beats them all. To be honest I was ready to write my own messaging app until I found this one because Google's has become so slow and bloated it was unusable. Good work!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I like the privacy with incoming texts like iPhones have. I have had quite a few outgoing failed texts for some reason which is why I gave it 4 stars. I paid for the app after the free trial and would suggest it because the ads got really annoying and in the way.,4
com.textra,A Google user,I loved this app but since the most recent update I can no longer send MMS messages. I downloaded this app originally because I wanted an app that sent MMS messages without any problems and found that to be the case with Textra... unfortunately this is no longer the case. Without this bug the app would be amazing.,2
com.textra,Suzanne W Cole Sullivan,"Here's why I bought Textra: scheduled texts. Here's why Textra isn't 5 stars (yet): I'd like to set custom photo backgrounds for my conversations. It's a feature my Android texting app used to have (Sony's default texting app), but that's literally the only feature I miss from an otherwise lackluster experience. Textra is a winner in every other respect.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Updated review: Update seems to have fixed the issue. Ty. __ App has been messing up completely with sending photos and videos. Stuck in sending mode. Have to turn off WiFi (in multiple locations) to send. Please fix ASAP. Should be a foundation of the texting environment.,5
com.textra,Aaron DeSanto,"Been using Textra for years now and very happy with it. I got it for timed messages and multiple notifications for unread messages. Receives regular updates but nothing intrusive and nothing that's ever broken core functionality for me, which apparently is too much to ask of many apps.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Update 2/11: still having issues with adding pics and emojis via the plus sign in the app. Contacted them with no fix. it was fixed for a while but then another update messed it up again. Have had this app for a while and always loved it but now I can't use the 'add' button to add pics, emojis, etc. while using app with Gboard on my Galaxy S9. Fix for this would make it 5 stars.",2
com.textra,ROBERT WILGOSZ,"Let me start by saying that I really love this app and I would like to keep it I find it cumbersome I think it is too overly complicated it can be simplified he should not have to go through so many steps to delete a message it should be very simple to Black List for block someone not sure what the difference between blacklisting or blocking someone, this should be open icons at the top of the screen to really simplify things and have them readily available @ all times,not keep reop dropdown box",3
com.textra,Stone Cyfer,"I've been using Textra for *years*, spanning different phones. I've never had any sort of ""real"" issues with the app and I do not plan on using any other app for texting.

com.textra,A Google user,I love this app so much. I've been using it for well over a year. Theres only one thing that has continually happened since ive had it that's REALLY INCONVENIENT: I dont receive all my texts. It's like if I dont text someone first I wont get what they send me. It happens with everyone not just one or two people. Someone could text me all day and I won't get any of it but if I text them I'll start getting their texts. Eveyone keeps telling me to switch apps but I have no other issues. Please help.,3
com.textra,Maggie Okray,I actually got the app because my text provider decided I couldn't customize my notification ringtones. Got this app and it was perfect! Recently had an issue where none of my texts would send... but I deleted and redownloaded it and it has been working fine. Love it!,5
com.textra,Tracy Driver,"One of the best texting apps Ive ever used and I have used many. So user friendly, manageable, & any option you could wamt to add to a contact its here.

Mood had been doing the job but they messed up after last update. Didn't wanna get pro till I try it first. But was fast and nice set up. Really need all my messages.

com.textra,Oscar Cachu,"The app is the most amazing customizable app on the android platform. One of the few apps I've ever bought the pro version for. However, with the new update Ive lost the ability to change my notification sound for specific contacts and I'm a little upset at that :/",5
com.textra,A Google user,So far this app is great.it does everything I want and need in a texting app which are: 1. I have a dual SIM phone and need ability to text using both numbers and this app does it nicely. Simply toggle between sims and send 2. Stable and fast which this app is 3. Ability to blacklist numbers as I receive those cherished spam / scam texts on occasion 4. Work with group texts fine and send images etc like all texting apps support these days,5
com.textra,Sean Miller,"It's so fast and easy to use. The search functionality is also top notch. I love the auto color coating of contacts option. And all the customization available. I also love being able to swipe out of a conversation, it reminds me of how CyanogenMod used to be <3",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love this app! Does everything it should, love the look, and really Iove how customizable everything is! I haven't had a single problem with it. The one teeny thing I would ask for is a musical note as an option for the customizable notification icons.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I abandoned the Samsung messaging app when they got rid of all my text tones, switched to Messages and their last update was an epic fail. Textra offers all the customizable features I need! Clean, fully customizable, and easy to use.",5
com.textra,A Google user,This app is AWESOME!! Can't believe I've been using Samsung's default messaging app for the past 10 years LOL....love that this app allows multiple photos shared quickly in text and also can forward a group of texts quickly --2 things definitely lacking with the Samsung texting app...THANK U TEXTRA!!!!,5
com.textra,A Google user,Good platform. Dissapointing you have to pay to not be tormented by ads..but hey nothing's free. Android comes with a pretty good sms platform..I tried this one because my phone was sending duplicate texts..turns out it's not the platform it's my phone...good thing Google surveys gives you some dough for answering surveys that's what paid for the premium version. Good app though.,4
com.textra,A Google user,converted from iPhone to Galaxy and the default text message app was horrible. I love using textra! it's the best app for texting out of all the ones I've tried. I enjoy being able to customize group chats and change colors of each person!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using Textra for two years. I love this app because the amount of customization that is possible. For each contact you can choose vibration patterns, led color, chat color, and the list goes on. I highly recommend Textra",5
com.textra,A Google user,"initially bought because stock app had slowed down due to data size, Textra solved that problem. My new phone did not have the data problem in the stock apo, but I continue to use Textra for it's great features, such as delay send and timed send. i purchased the pro version for a nominal fee, great app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app and very customisable. I very rarely install 3rd party apps but I made an exeption for Textra as I needed a good messaging app that I could add a signature automatically to my TXTs. One of my gripes though is that I have to go throught too many steps to get to the contacts ""contact details"" on the stock std app you just have to click on the contacts icon. I use Textra for business purposes so those features are a necessity. Again great app.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this App, blows away the standard texting app, total control, set up any way you like, colors, sounds, use Zedge, for text and ring tone sounds for every contact! Actually BLOCKS messages from people that are BLOCKED! Doesn't just hide them somewhere, that's not Blocking!! The way it should be!! Wake up Samsung, you make a ridiculous amount of money on these phones, make the apps geared towards End Users.",5
com.textra,Jeff Greenert,"By far, the best messaging app for Android Auto. Sesrch function is fantastic. A buddy that is a life long Apple user asked when we installed some plants. I searched on our messaged and found it was 3 years ago. Something he could not do. Great customer support on issues.",5
com.textra,Sonic,"The color schemes are great, can change the font size to reduce eye strain even more. Can respond to messages right form the notification shade. Or from pop-up window. It's a pretty convenient sms app.",5
com.textra,Jessica Fredrick,I like the customization features on this app and I like the pop up screen when you have another app open and you recieve a message.. But I dont like that you can't call from the app there is no call button on the message screen. Also sometimes pictures wont send. And you can't take a picture to send through the app you have to go out of app to camera to take a picture then go back into the app and send it.,3
com.textra,George Sangster,"The app works as it should, however the text arriving notification sounds is the same as a message notice when their new ads are displayed. I have a small car service business, on call response, so ad notices are beyond annoying particularly @ 5:30am! Come-on Textra you can do better??? Fix it plz? Or good bye.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the way it is very customizable. For Xiaomi users, it resolves the issue of not being able to reply via Notification shade. It also works with Galaxy Watch in a sense that you can reply from your watch even if you are not using a Samsung phone. If I want an alternative SMS app, I always use this whatever my phone is.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is a great texting app and I love the pop up feature, which is why i keep coming back to it. My only caviat, and its not big, is that I cant share location. Its not a huge deal, and its very situational but it be nice if it were an option. other than that its perfect.",5
com.textra,Lisa Anime,"So the response I got stated the MMS protocol doesnt allow adding and removing in groups. Then how come Samsung messaging and pixel messaging allows adding of people? Samsung allows the removing of people as well which automatically creates a new group. Can't add or remove people from groups once created. Also, no easy where to get to gallery where app states it saves pictures and videos.",4
com.textra,Josh Galst,"Was having a good time with the app, until very recently when my group messages stopped working for it.

com.textra,A Google user,"I paid for the ad free version and go figure it starts to go downhill. All the MMS features don't work. There's no audio in my videos that I know I have audio on, most times they dont send. Seriously? Best app? Can I get a refund? Not using this app again.",1
com.textra,Wind Rider,"Great app! It has a lot of useful features like being able to mute and unmute specific threads, or pin favorites to the top of your messages. You can also color code contacts/threads and make custom notifications. I had a minor glitch once and got personalized help from Textra administrator Max within hours. Thanks Max!",5

com.textra,Angel Quinones,"I paid for the pro version of this app a long time ago. And it's okay. But for MMS messaging, it's the worst. Yeah you can send pictures and gifs here and there. But don't even bother trying to send a video. It just will not go. And I'm not talking a video that's 20 minutes long. Even short videos that are maybe two or three seconds long, will not go through no matter what you do. I've tried everything. I've already spent the money on pro, and that money is never coming back to me. So I'm out.",2
com.textra,Victor Sullivan,"I started using this app. because it allows for individual message tones for your contacts. I love this app. Easily customizable. Able to customize your send and receive blocks with different colors, able to pick a particular symbol to go with your contact.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Editing my review: For anyone upset over not being able to customize icons anymore: remove the app, search for the APK of the last version, install it, run it. Super easy and takes just a couple of minutes, tops. Definitely will not be updating the app ever again.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I really like this txt app. I can use better stickers with this rather than the creepy Samsung AR emojis that come on the Galaxy S9. The ads are not intrusive being placed at the top. Publisher suggestion: run a sale on your app or drop the price to $2. Since the ads are not intrusive, I suspect purchase rates are low at $4. Drop the price to $2 and I'm a buyer! ** I've updated to 5 stars after finding a bunch of new customizable options and after a quick response to my review!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great text App, I got tired of one of my default text programs on my Google phone and decided to try a new app that cost. It's well worth it.

com.textra,Robin Rawet,This app was working beautiful but about 2 months ago I started having issues with messages failing to send. I reverted back to the standard messaging app that came with my phone and don't have any problems. I use t-mobile network through Consumer Cellular.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Really great app. Ive had no problems with it. However after abit it dose have ads, but if u just pay like 4$ it gets rid of them. I reccomend paying if your going to be using this full time. Its fully customizable and just runs very well.",5
com.textra,A Google user,purchased the pro version which is great to be honest. However the single bin tap and double tick icon caught me out so I ended up deleting all texts. Watch out! So completed back up and restore but this doesn't apply to textra for some reason only legacy text app! Good otherwise.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"I like being able to have an auto signature. which I lost when I upgraded phones. That said, this auto signature will not automatically drop to the next line and if you hit enter to do that, it is indented slightly. minor annoyance.",4

It is very easy to use and looks great. It is very fast with photos and videos. I have an update. Every time I reboot my phone, the shortcut disappears from my screen and I have to go into my app drawer and put it back on the screen. Why is it doing that?",4
com.textra,A,"A great app in almost every respect, BUT, could you please move the Sim select button? Being so close to the send button results in it being inadvertently pressed and the message is sent from the wrong Sim. A pop up menu would probably solve this too. Thanks",4

It turns out it wasn't my carrier. Textra allows me to send video clips to my friends and notifications are bug free. I upgraded to the paid version of it so I could prevent the ads. I recommend this app!",5

com.textra,William Corin,The best texting so I've found. The improvements over the past 2 years have been really great. I use this every day and it just keeps getting better! The best update with the ability to look at media is amazing! There's no other texting app that comes even close.,5

I do miss the RCS style chat but wondered if there was any way to include Advanced Messaging or Universal Profile 1.0 that usually come with the default messaging apps?

com.textra,Rob Canfield,Can't set notification sound per conversation. 5 stars and this becomes my messaging app if you add this capability or show me what I'm missing. I hate using Google but their app allows me to do this so I know if I need to drop what I'm doing when I get a text or if it can wait. UPDATE: That worked! Is there a way to rename an MMS conversation? And also stop the keyboard from popping up when I scroll through a conversation? 5 stars as promised.,5

com.textra,A Google user,"This is a great app ! But can I make a suggestion ?! Is there any way you guys could change the way you add people to a group chat?

If you guys could simplify that or fix it in a way, the app would be perfect !",5

With that said, great app, love the customization and the cherry on top is the ability to stop my screen from coming on with every received text.",5
com.textra,Daisy Palace,"Very nice SMS app but I always end up deleting because I don't like an ad bar running through my messages. Other than that, I really like it. Many colors to customize and many features.",4
com.textra,Jessica Hildreth,I love the app. A problem has popped up recently though. The emoji I choose isn't the emoji that shows up. For example when I press thumbs up the clapping hands show up. When I press green sick face the zipper mouth face comes up. Seems like everything is off by a couple spots.,5
com.textra,Christian Trujillo,Amazing texting app. I've been using Textra for a few years now and I haven't used another texting app since. Great customization options really allows you to make it your own experience. Highly recommend for anybody looking to get away from theie default texting app.,5
com.textra,gabby sabina,"I was getting really frustrated with Google messages, so I started using Textra And let me tell you it is so much better! This app works so fast and I honestly would recommend it to anyone! I don't have the paid version but even then, the ads are not bad!",5
com.textra,alesia hurlbert,I redownloaded this app not too long ago and it's still telling me my pictures aren't sending when they are. It's super annoying to have it do that when people send pictures frequently. This happened before and that's why I uninstalled it. May do it again.,3
com.textra,John R,Works for me. Quick reply when I had a question on adding multiple pictures to the text message. Delay send is great. Was easy to customize to my liking. Another quick response to a problem I had.,5
com.textra,David Caissie,"5 stars no matter what the outcome of my question. Been using this app for nearly ever. Recently got a Samsung 20 FE 5g. On all my new phones I place a shortcut to text my wife from her message screen. I can't remember how to make it open in full app when notification is pressed vs pop-up. I know it's there I just can't find it. If you can help great, if not still great. Textra is my go to always. Update to above... All fixed with help from Jason. Thanks Textra 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 (Extra 5)",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Good App....But the app developers are not even concerned to introduce update or even implement to resolve issues. There is a Huge User's suggestions and feedbacks...regarding Privacy folder, Archiving sms, along with Inbox, Outbox, Sent, Draft folder features.. I am switching to a better App ""Pulse SMS"" who offer much better features.",2
com.textra,A Google user,I've been looking for a good app to use to send group text also like that the group text are sent out as individual text. Textra has worked really well. I love being able to send pics. I do occasionally have issues but not nothing major.,4

com.textra,Guava Jelly,What is with these crazy notification sounds? Help! Awful. Let's fix it! You push out an app update. Now my notification sounds are totally crazy. But I must do the research? I will probably just go back to the regular Android messenger for a couple of updates then come back. Thank you for the opportunity to do your research though!,3
com.textra,A Google user,"I don't have a star rating for this (yet). I installed it to use with my Fitbit Versa. After a week, I was asked to upgrade to Pro (ad free) for $3.99 + tax. There is no information available about this upgrade or the cost; if it's a monthly, annual or 1 time charge. I like the app so far but am a bit nervous to exchange money when the Pro version of the app isn't even available in the Google Play app store. I went to the website and it redirects you back to the app store.",2
com.textra,John Cherokee,"Not too bad. I like the options it has and has yet to freeze or any issues for that matter. Only complaint is the ads, but that's what ya get when your a cheapskate like me. Realistically the ads are far and rew between so cant really complain",4
com.textra,A Google user,Great app great support. I like that I can set colors to contacts and sounds for each caller and messages from different contacts. Had problems sending mms once carrier problem app techs fixed with software update. Second user error that was quickly corrected with advice.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love this app. Best text messaging app replacement, and I've tried a lot. Great out of the box, but the theming, add-on emoji packs and customization makes this choice a no-brainer (imho). Worth spending a small bit of $ to support the devs for sure. 👍",5
com.textra,A Google user,I rarely use voice texting and typing is horrible with all my typos. This app predicts well enough to just tap on the proper word and get on with it. I will always use it! And the ads don't bother me.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"When I saw this app I thought it would not meet my expectations. Seeing the colors and the extravagance of the colors I thought it was something more than what we usually see in the app. However I can say that I have been amazed with the wonderfulness of this app, it has really covered my expectations as to what I was looking for for many months. I can send independent bulk messages, without the need to create a group, I can connect the groups of my regular phone app with this application...",5
com.textra,ChickenOnFireFilms,"Good looking and easily customizable. You can switch between emoji packs easily, and the dark mode looks great.. textra is the best sms app on Google play store. I just wish there were more color options or the ability to create custom colors",5
com.textra,Kevin Sallee,"Great app, amount of customization is awesome. Ads are small and just look like an extra text conversation so dealable if you dont want premium. Suggestion would be if possible to add text scheduling, so i could say set a text to send tomorrow at a set time.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"so far so good! this app works way better than the stock messages app that came on my Huawei, its really fast and there arent ads or anything that ive seen so far. you can also customize pretty much every aspect of the app which i love because i really like my phone to match! Edit:it turns out there were ads once my free trial ran out, but this messaging app felt so much more natural and was so much better than the default messaging app on my phone, so i just went ahead and payed the $4 for pro",5
com.textra,Jessica Randle,"What happened? I loved this app and just updated it a couple days ago. Now I can't send or receive pictures. I went through this once before and have already adjusted the setting to ""fix"" the last time this problem occured & this time no fix? Samsung Galaxy S8",3

com.textra,J Gambeck,"Nice, but some things don't work.. I switched from mood messanger that shows web previews to links. I was hoping this could too since it has it in the settings but sadly it doesn't work. Secondly these emojis look bad compared mood messanger polished animated emojis. So this text app is kinda a downgrade for me.",3
com.textra,Tyson Haney,This app has everything you could want and probably something you didn't even consider. EDIT: Would love smart watch support but that doesn't detract from how great this app is. EDIT #2: Still the best texting app I have ever found. No reason to look further for me. The developer is responsive to criticism in an extremely positive manner.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Would give it five stars, but for one reason. Different times I just simply want to send 1 long text, it takes its time working, then, doesn't send the text I spent all that time on. Other than that, sometimes it has trouble receiving an SMS text. No idea why.",4
com.textra,Mindy Parsons,"More and more I open Textra to respond to a text and it isn't entering my typing, or committing the words if I do speech to text. I always have to close and relaunch it when this happens. It's really getting on my nerves. I am ready to look at other text apps",2
com.textra,Talon Karde (C Lucas),Great texting app. Love the ability to schedule messages. Seemless gif integration. Excellent tech support. Recently had a issue related to specific hardware; the support and development teams were eager to assist and rectified the problem.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Excellent except for notification badges. I wish it was built in instead of something you have to add from your launcher (I use Nova). Something changed recently and now when I clear notifications from my pull down notification drawer it also clears the badge number from the icon as though the messages were read. Previously I could clear my drawer but still see and respond to messages later. UPDATE: Thanks for your reply, that worked. Updated to 5 stars instead of 4 great app.",5
com.textra,Karen Eierman,"Easy way to communicate a few words quickly as well as long messages. I use it to stay in touch daily with family and as a notification tool by anyone from our pharmacy to getting verification of online purchases. Its very easy to use. For the second time I've lost ALL conversations and their history! I have done nothing to make this happen. WHY? WHAT CAN BE DONE TO RETRIEVE ALL LOST TEXTS??? Oh, and I have no idea where that first comment came from, doesn't sound like something I'd write!",1

I allowed the notification and have all the setting right. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but nothing change. This app has served me well but I have to uninstall this app permanently now.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Love the features. I use this app to help me eliminate texting the wrong person. The delayed send feature is great too, gives you a few extra seconds to decide if you meant to hit send for individual recipients, not all contacts.",5
com.textra,G N,Would be 5 if Textra had an archive. I have communicated several times with no response one way or other. Would now like to change to a 1 star because of your scolding me. OK product... terrible customer service! I have changed to 1 star. App has become quirky. No longer get sounds alert. I'm Android savvy.... others have this problem. Still no archive. Soon as I back up... will find another App. PLEASE NO SCOLDING OR LECTURES. Have tried all outside of resetting phone.... NO WAY,1
com.textra,Feder,"Overall good experience, but what's the use of the 'leave unread' button on a notification ? We can just swipe for the same result. And we don't have a short way to mark as read, so why not replace this 'leave unread' button by a 'mark as read' button. It would be great ☺️",4
com.textra,A Google user,My fav sms app yet. Never fails or leaves messages unsent. Blacklisting is easy. Sending muti pics and group text is easy. No intrusive ads. My favorite feature is that I love the ability to customize each contact's bubble colors and notification icon. #realperson,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using this as my default texting app for years. Mostly for contact-unique notification tones, but also for scheduling texts. UPDATE: It's been moved, apparently. Absolutely HATE arbitrary GUI changes, but the feature's there. Whatever.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Seems fine but Textra flat out refuses to make customizeable or transparent background. moving on to something different. *reply to developer: Perhaps so. But users have been asking for it for it for almost 5 years and have told its not going to happen.,2
com.textra,Caleb Metzger,"It's a great app. I like how the color of the messages change depending on the contact. It loses two stars because I don't have the option of selecting the ""save location"" of mms pictures",3
com.textra,Feroz Iftikhar,"Best android text messaging app, upgraded to pro 2 years ago and never looked back. Installed it on my friends' devices as soon as they switch to android and they too cannot use any other SMS app. Highly recommend, upgrade is extremely cheap as well.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Easy to use app. Well worth paying the small charge after the initial trial. I opted for this as my new Samsung a40 messaging app was pre loaded with annoying pop up ads. Textra has lots of added extras and is very easy to use.,5
com.textra,Barbara Breger,really enjoyable experience. i like the multiple choice of emoji apps. Also appreciate the 2nd choice on deleting. an undo is a great idea. How about that? --It is a year later and still enjoying Textra. Loads of good features. Having fun with the gifs and emojis etc.,5
com.textra,A Google user,So simple yet incredibly powerful. Have yet to find another texting app that comes close to this. One feature I'd like to see: the ability to archive messages (removing them from the main list without deleting them).,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Really enjoyable, makes texting alot more personal. I can change the notification icon for each contact so everyone has their own icon, I can customize the colors of each chat, change the vibration for each contact, all in all it allows me to personalize everyone so that each conversation is personal to that contact.",5
com.textra,A Google user,My review initially had a problem with the ad placement but after leaving my middling review textra immediately responded informing me that there is a setting to change where the ads are served in app. This is a fantastic app and I'm extremely pleased with the responsiveness of their team.,5
com.textra,Barbara Johnsen,I am very happy with the app because I text and I can correct spelling. Also in the car I can send voice to text messages and they are fairly accurate. I only wish the phone icon was on the messaging page but that is minor.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Just needs 1 thing so far... The Veruzon txt app gave me the ability to easily switch between blast SMS and Group MMS per chat/conversation. And if I wanna group I want serious notification controls, which I think this has. Is that feature doable?

(where's my pager)? :-)",3
com.textra,Cugino Gianni,"Great app, My only complaint is the program should have an option to store its data on the external SD card. I've used Textra for almost 3 years now and the resident data is over 9GB and it is now causing storage issues on my device. Best, John",4
com.textra,A Google user,"When my favorite texting app asks to run targeted ads, especially with Facebook as a partner, I feel as if they're using your messages to run these targeted ads. They don't even say what they're using to determine the ads. I'll be looking elsewhere. Definitely loved Textra for the last 4 years but time to move on.",1
com.textra,Michael Williams,I'm new to Textra and was recommended to try it by a friend after all the problems I was having with the standard built in android text app. Textra has worked pretty much flawlessly ever since I installed it about a few weeks ago. Going to continue to use Textra now as my default messaging app and I would recommend it to ANYONE!,5
com.textra,Brian Scott,"I've been using the free version of this app for years and I'm about to pay and support Textra because the app works so good for me and my situation. I'm legally blind and this app allows me the dark theme, to enlarge the fonts more than other apps, and it has flawlessly work. The only downside I've ever seen to the app is how it will build up a large file size in storage over time. But I did search and find a way to clear that out as well by resync'ing the app. Texta is great! 5 stars!",5
com.textra,David Francis,Great application! I am very impressed with the myriad of options available to customize the app to my liking. it is very user friendly with no learning curve. I will recommend this app to my friends and family members! Keep up the good work team. Please give us the opportunity to create even local accounts to save our blacklisted items. So when we upgrade our devices we can simply login to our accounts with The blacklist already intact. 👍👍,4
com.textra,A Google user,"SOLVED:Whenever I open the app from a notification, the app will not open in full screen. Been trying new messaging apps and this is the only app that does this. For anyone else experiencing this problem this is the response I got from the dev. Textra Settings > Customize Notifications > Define Notification Action > Tapping Opens > Full App.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Frustrating. Suddenly my notifications weren't playing and then I figured I'd delete and redownload only to have notifications from months ago pop up and I responded to messages that I didn't realize were old. Then my current messages disappeared. I just gave up and removed the app from my device.,2
com.textra,Joseph Benavidez,I used to use this app a lot but recently it stopped allowing me to recieve gif or photo messages every once in a while. This is unacceptable so I had to delete the app. Thats unfortunate because it has so many features that the regular messaging app does not.,2

com.textra,Raymundo Montes,I have to say this is probably the best SMS/MMS app I can find. I paid the extra and it was well worth it! Their customer service is phenomenal. Every question I have sent them has been answered within the next day. I really love the fact you can pin a message to the top. My stock Android or Verizon one doesn't do that.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Have loaded this app on my Huawei phone and the phone rings a lot better as a result. The original text app kept slowing the phone so much I had to reboot it regularly. Its fun to be able to customise the interface and works well.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I prefer Textra to my pre-installed factory app. Easy to use. Nice display options. Love the ""blacklist"" feature, and ability to email your message thread. Just wish the ads would go away... Without having to pay for it.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Pretty great alternative to regular messaging apps. Great customization features and so many options to make it your own style. The only drawback is that Android stopped LED notification light modifications but that's no fault of the app.,4

com.textra,A Google user,Love this app. even paid for the premium version but recently i was not getting texts from people. not all of them just certain people at random times. turns out it was the textra not receiving the messages. uninstalled it and used my original sms app and the texts came in. hopefully you can get this resolved.,3

com.textra,A Google user,Unfortunately I've had some bad experience with this app. It's been randomly blocking some of the incoming SMS messages. They were basically nowhere to be found. My friends and online banking service have made me notice this. :( Had to switch to default SMS app to have it working again.,1
com.textra,A Google user,this is best I've ever used. consistently upgraded. no bugs. no ads. it's perfectly customizable. then again i have the pro version because nothing good is free. there has to be funding in order to have development.,5
com.textra,djojo2486,Great app!! Grateful for it. Gave it 3 stars because I wish it could handle fast paced group chats better but definitely better than my stock android messaging app so can't complain too much. Also since the last update all the media I receive through the messages is soooooo blurry. None of the pictures are clear. And the videos have never been good but now they are the worst things in the world. Please fix!!!!!,3

Also, when I want to send a picture to a group, the app won't find the group, you have to re-add them individually. You can, from the group, add a picture but it should work both ways.",4

com.textra,A Google user,Pretty sure I bought the app a long time ago. Got a new phone and now it keeps popping up an annoying add to upgrade to premium. If I had not done it already I would because I love it. If i have to upgrade again or just ignore the add I'd rather uninstall. Three stars since I dont know how this will go.🤗,3
com.textra,Katie Robinson,"This app is extremely easy to use, super user friendly and customizable, and looks very sleek. I've been a supporter for several years now, and no other messaging app is the same. Textra is the first app I download on a new phone.",5
com.textra,Marco Betheo,Textra offers unique features that I actually use like the ability to type a text now that sends in the future and the ability to add a delay between hitting send and the text actually going out which helps catch mistakes. The company actually responds to questions regarding features quickly which is refreshing.,5
com.textra,Stephen Spaghetti,"Update: working again it was a Google problem crashing many apps...textra contacted me within minutes of seeing my review with the solution. Thanks. Uninstall android system webview in playstore to fix... ""Crashes... Stuck in a loop need to Uninstall to stop loop. unable to open app randomly stopped working 3/22 /21.""",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Absolutely fantastic text app, have been using it since hangouts dropped sms and its been fantastic, 100% worth becoming a pro user for a couple bucks. Have had to contact support once and everyone was grest in helping me take care of the problem i was having. A+ app and A+ customer service!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Wonderful product. The only feature I can think of would be to allow a new group conversation to start by deleting a member of a current conversation just like one can add people. Update: Create a category of ""Retired Groups"". A group can be added to the retired category to keep the conversation from being lost but remove it from addition conversation. This keeps it from being mistakenly chosen for a conversation: it no longer showes up in the main Textra window.",4
com.textra,M Taylor,"Good app, does what it should. I like the ability to pin my top contacts so I don't have to look for them as they are always at the top of the list. The only improvement would be the ability to automatically detect spam messages. I spend a good portion of the day blocking messages since they aren't detected and blocked.",4
com.textra,Damon Myers,I paid for the add free version of this app while attempting to make my Samsung function more like an iPhone (long story why I don't have an iPhone). I love the app. Functions great. Wasn't difficult to set up and sync'd all of my contacts no problem.,5
com.textra,Gene Reif,"Been using it and, It does exactly what a messaging app should, plus great Support! I'd recommend this app to anyone, Just wish it worked on my Samsung Tab.A 10.5. :) now telling me my trial period is over. I thought I paid for a permanent application. If not, time to delete. Doesn't work on my Tablet anyway. Samsung message works great.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"SUCKS. i had this app over different phones for 4 YEARS. what happened to the update?! i cannot send messages, always says FAILED MESSAGES. and also, even though i dont have any load, the message delivered said SENT. VERY CONFUSING. now i temporarily use my phone's defat messaging which REEEEEAAALLLY SUUUUCKS. c'mon developers, i admire your minimalistic approach towards messaging, but i think you gotta pay more attention on the occurring bugs before you add any upgrades.",1
com.textra,TJ Moutard,I have used Textra for a long time. The customization that is available is great and the biggest reason I have stayed with Textra and recommend it to others. The customer service is also excellent and very responsive! All around great app!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Loved this app, bought pro, but it's started to have issues. Sometimes texts won't show, I can no longer send any attachments (I've tried reinstalling, clearing cache etc), and texts will come out of order frequently.",3

com.textra,Anthony A,"Inconsistent. This app keeps getting disconnected from sms servers and constantly asks me to retry. After retrying a dozen times I finally get a plethora of texts (not in order). When it works, it's good, but I've gotten asked to ""retry"" way too many times.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"Looks good, feels good but still lacking features they could easily implement. Private messages (found on Pulse SMS) is one feature that would make me go from a 2 star review to a 5 star one. Update: I will meet you in the middle at 3 stars. Do you have any plans of implementing private messages in the near future? I would be willing to pay a premium seeing that the rest of the app seems to work fairly well. Thank you for the prompt response.",3
com.textra,Googles User,"Laggy app now, after updating... takes 30 sexonds to load text name page, to type. I clear cache and all, delete old videos... takes forever now to open.

Motorola supra g7 phone, all stock and it ran fine for a year until updated app a month or so ago.",2

com.textra,A Google user,I have tried several different texting apps and always end up going back to Samsung. I have had Textra for over a month now and have no reason to switch back this time. Love the extras Textra provides without sacrificing anything I liked about the old app. Update: still using and love Textra!,5
com.textra,SoloJ Foster,It was a very intuitive experience and very user-friendly. It was easy to navigate and the ads for the app are minimally shown. It's also very customizable so No one's app should be exactly the same💯 Great Job,5
com.textra,Aspen !real!,"Love the astheyic of how you can customize the bubbles and background. No problems that I've had with this app! I DEFINITLEY recommend this app for people that are a Samsung user that want to customize text messages. No problems with me that I've found! Until then, think of getting this app!",5
com.textra,Jessica Shearer,"It started not sending any GIF or pictures & if you uninstall & then reinstall it, it deletes almost every message up to a certain date.

So everything & anything someone has sent me since then is gone.... Really disappointed",1
com.textra,Izzy,Used to love this app but not being able to search within messages unlike fb messenger or block a number from the chat area instead of having to memorize the number then go into participants and blocking from there is atrocious. Currently looking for a new texting application that will have these extremely basic functions.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"Liked this app very much until the most recent update. Bring back coloured notification! This is the ONLY REASON I used this app. For someone with no notification led on their phone this feature is an absolute must. Bring it back. Otherwise, Goodbye. There are many apps on the market.",2
com.textra,Jim R,"Update: Thank you, I followed your instructions and they have worked so far! Now if I can only get iheart to stop being unstable! I had to go to a different messaging app,Textra kept (""stopped working""). I can't deal with that!! Started this afternoon!",4
com.textra,A Google user,Ive used textra for several years now and I love it. I can customize my notifications n rightones. I have 8 children & they each have different notification that way i know which one is calling or texting. The color scheme is so vivid. I wont use another texting app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Simple and Stunning! I have tried several text apps and found ""Textra"" to be the best. Extremely user friendly with lots of options to personalize for multiple texts. I upgraded to the paid NO ADS version and I absolutely LOVE this app!",5
com.textra,Will T,"tbh i really love this app, ive used it for years, and it is 100× better than any defult texting app in every way So you used to be able to set custom vibration patterns, and now you can't. I won't dock the stars because I'm sure its because of the way Samsung updated their phones but is there any way to reapply this feature?",5
com.textra,A Google user,Love this app! The customizations are fun to dabble with. One thing I wish they would implement is that the text color would change to whatever is easier to see when auto theme is on. Other then that great text app worth purchasing.,5
com.textra,Amy Dommett,Wonderfully customizable. Have been using for years. Happy to pay for ad free version. Seems like latest update allows unread messages to not stay at top of screen. Also would really appreciate a 'mark as unread' option.,5
com.textra,NOVETH TOSE Ezeh,This app is really great. But please can you add a feature that allows us to edit the database of a group conversation we already created. We might need to remove someone from the group list or add someone else without having to start creating a whole new database. Thank you,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Since new update, It Is terrible! Every time I try to send a pic or video I get the three dots like it is trying to send. 90% of the time it doesn't go through. 10% of the time it goes through, but it still shows that it is trying to send!",1

com.textra,A Google user,This app is the best app I have ever had for messaging! I have never seen so much customization options for a free app! This app is amazing.

com.textra,Chris S,"This app used to be great. Now mms and group texts don't work more than half the time. The native messages app now has almost the same features. I will try this app again in a few months, maybe they will fix it.",1

com.textra,A Google user,won't send videos anymore. i changed mms settings to every different option and never wil send videos unless they are less than 10 seconds long. worst part is i actually paid for the premium version which is disappointing because i loved the customization.,2
com.textra,Morgan,"I use textra instead of the default Samsung app for messaging, i use textra pro and compared to the default (samsung) app it is a world of joy to use. Only complaint is it would be nice if it were a little easier somehow to send scheduled messages, however I miss that feature dearly on my iPhone.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"Love the app. You guys took away colored notifications a while ago stating that it wasn't supported by Android anymore, but as of late, I noticed that a few of my apps have had colored notifications on the status bar. Is that something that could be brought back?",5
com.textra,A Google user,I like the app. I would like the ability to select all messages and delete them with one click.  Update. The developers wrote back quickly to provide a solution to my problem.  Will apply the solution today when I clear a heap of old messages.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is an awesome app that offers a wide range of customization. after a certain trial. They ask you to either pay a set amount, or to accept advertisements. I had no trouble deciding on purchasing the premium version. Overall I'm very pleased.",5

com.textra,Craig,Great app and solid tech support. Issues with sending images or any type of MMS are a issue with Android OS and not related to third party apps. Its a fact of life that you need to use LTE for those data packets no thanks to the overlords empire of Google trying to pinch great apps like Textra!,5
com.textra,A Google user,I first downloaded this when my default text app started lagging. Have had no problems! I love how I can customize absolutely everything about the way my messages look and sound for every contact and it is always lightning quick,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Endless customization and organization. You can pin messages to the top, change group names, change group colors and individual contacts colors, set custom notifications, and even change how the app itself looks. So glad it's free and still so amazing.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Happy! Allows me to dedicate notification tones to individual contacts and to save/lock individual text bubbles. Also allows me to delete multiple bubbles at a time. Other fun features is changing bubble shape/color/font and notification icon for individual contacts.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Best SMS/MMS app I've found for android. Ad banner isn't annoying. Some ads are useful and, if I'm getting worried by how closely they match what I've been looking for I know it's time to reset my ad tracker. Defientely reccomend it over the stock SMS app on Samsung.",5
com.textra,Karen Labonte,"Text app the works! MMS, SMS, personalizing, it does it all. Free version has ads after a month, but they are not obnoxious. If you don't want the ads, the price is good.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Great app. I've been using it for years now. I got the new S10 and downloaded the app immediately. Now I got this annoying floating Textra widget that keeps coming back no matter how many times I remove it. I will gladly give this app 5 stars if there's a way to permanently remove that friggin' widget. Update : issue resolved. 5 ⭐ Thanks to developer response.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Great personalization of theme. I feel very comfortable using this app because I can customize the way I feel. I suggest the dev team to add a private box feature for private message and synchronization for multiple device access.,4
com.textra,Brian (Brian),"I purchased this app to get rid of ads. A phone change later and the ads are back. Their support has been useless. I'm not buying it again. I'm sorry google ""lost"" the transaction history. I have a really hard time believing this isn't all intentional to get another 5 bucks outta me.",1
com.textra,A Google user,Suddenly stopped working. I have used the app for many years without issues and I currently have a oneplus 6. I suddenly was not able to send or receive message and other messaging apps worked fine. I noticed reviews with people complaining of same problem,1
com.textra,A Google user,"App is a great alternative to default messaging app. However, PLEASE have an option to revert back to the old app icon style. The new icon on a white background is really ugly and stands out way too much. I wish I could uninstall the newest update just to get the old app icon back.",3
com.textra,Nunya Bizzness,"Will change back to 5 when it works properly. Starting 2 days ago, I can no longer send messages to certain people or groups. I use this for work and it has caused some major issues. I do not know if it is related to last update. It worked beyond perfect until 2 days ago.",1
com.textra,A Google user,I love the ability to schedule text and also to place a few second delay before sending texts. This allows me to quickly correct an error should I notice one. Solid app. The ads dont feel intrusive at all.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra has so far solved the challenge of the group text issue with the LG stock text app, but does not seem to have the ability to sync with my calendar. ☹️ Also, once a group is created there seems to be no way to edit the participants. If these isssue are resolved I would give a five star rating, but currently a 3.5 star seems right.",3
com.textra,A Google user,This is the most awesome app I have used in a long time! I love that I can customize my texts with any colors and font that I like! It makes it personal and fun! It also works SO well! I haven't had a single issue. Love this!!!!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app. I love the customization and I appreciate all of the smooth animations. only thing I'd request is an option to be able to apply colors to contacts, but keep the conversation bubbles the same.",5
com.textra,A Google user,No issues for the last 2 years. Had to change phones and wanted to backup my messages. Tried a 3rd party app but lost 90% of my texts. Would be 5 stars if a backup was integrated to Textra. Will be trying a different sms/mms app.,3
com.textra,Mika Meely,I love Textra.. Its practical and you can customize it.. Ive had it for a long time. The only thing that would make this even better is if we can see that the textee saw the message and possibly able to react to the message.. Im just dreaming but thanks for a great product.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Hi. there well it is just awsome. and brilliant. the only problem or drawback is that when the number of messeges go for example above 10000. app gets heavy and often doesn't send messeges and you have to retry.!,5
com.textra,Edie Shillum,I have been using Textra for 6 years now and it is by far my favourite app. I bought the pro version just so that I could support this amazing company. Highly recommend this app. I love how customizable the app is and there is a send delay you can set which is very helpful for last minute errors,5
com.textra,A Google user,I like the app so far but will ask if you all can fix the width of the message box. all of my texts are coming over as this long narrow text with only 2 or 3 words per line. it's a little aggravating.,4
com.textra,ganjaprincess13,Mostly no problem. Do not edit your app color on your home screen or it will disapear randomly. Almost no issues with freezing but does happen occasionally. But overall a great alternative to default app.,4
com.textra,EtherealCadaver,"This app makes me happy because I can customize each person's notification sound, color, and symbol. The only thing that would make it perfect is if you can have individual wallpapers per conversation.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Have the paid version, well worth it for the price of a few coffees for something I use all the time. Uses it to replace the messaging app on my pixel that was no longer receiving/sending properly and wouldn't MMS. Textra has been flawless, would recommend.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I actually really love this app. It is way faster and smoother than my default messenger on my note 9. I also like the custom ringtone, message and background options which is the reason I got the app in the first place since those things were taken away with my jump from the S5 to the Note9. It would be nice if I could add my own message tones instead of having to pick one of the default tones in the app. Overall though amazing work on this app guys lol. 10/10",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app. Pretty much everything is customizable. Handles group messaging way better than any stock messaging app I've ever used. I love that you can look back on past messages by date too, very convenient. Sends images, bitmojis, and gifs well.",5
com.textra,Russell Reed,"great text alternative, allows for the fun stuff, like gifs and stickers. interface is very intuitive. can't figure out how to change it over to dark mode is my only issue. Other than that, 👍🏻👍🏻",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Used to love this app. Now I Keep getting ""MMS timeout"" issues and not receiving messages. I work in sales, so if a client sends me a message and i don't see it, I'm literally losing money. Switching to Pulse until Textra gets this issue figured out.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Been using Textra for near 5 years or more, best texting app I've used. Only issues I've had is character limits, I have to split my longer messages into 2 manually, and sometimes texts are recieved late, which might be my service provider, but aside from that, it's amazing!",4
com.textra,A Google user,"You're looking at the best texting app in the market - period! I really can't fault this app. The fact that it flawlessly supports dark theme, I'm totally hooked. It also makes texting fun again. I highly recommend it instead of that boring default Android app.",5
com.textra,Rob Jones,"This has been my go-to text app for several years. Had an issue with it yesterday, emailed the developer and got a prompt response with detailed instructions that fixed it perfectly. Great app, and great customer service.",5
com.textra,SirClints,"Tried a number of text apps but always came back to this... Customizations are nice and easy, from colors to notifications and just overall display. Had it on my last 3 phones and will always use it. (works well with smart watches also)",5
com.textra,Nathaniel Esau,Will give 5 Stars once the compatability and stability bugs are ironed out with samsung DEX. Looking to get 1. A more email like split screen UI/UX. 2. To view the entire text thread on reply instead of having to reopen the app everytime to reply and see previous messages. Thanks -Nate,4
com.textra,A Google user,I've been using it for a while. I like it because it lets me customize the text bubble color for people texting me and for my outgoing texts. And you can customize the color for different people.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app for older phones. My 7 year old Rugby Pro phone runs And v.4.1 and stopped working with the AT&T texting apps 2 years ago. I found TEXTRA and it installed quickly and works flawlessly. I am about to upgrade my phone, but I will keep TEXTRA.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Ever since a recent update, I keep getting the error message ""Your carrier has a temporary MMS problem"". I've missed multiple messages and can't get pictures or anything like that anymore. I would really like a fix.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"My favourite texting app ,fully customizable, millions of colours to choose from -make it as plain or colourful as you like . You can add a delay to send your texts, so you can correct those awkward auto corrections. You can see if the sender received your message ...simply my favourite .",5
com.textra,Jd Spangler,No longer auto saves pics in the Textra folder. Just goes to pics. No way to change the folder. Textra folder was so much easier. Other than that little thing been enjoying the app ever since Samsung decided to screw up their Messages interface.,4
com.textra,A Google user,I tried this app for my Note 8 after both my Samsung message and Google messenger began to lag severally. To my surprise the app was lighting fast! It sends video and pictures faster and more clearer than both Google and Samsung messaging apps. Upgraded to the paid version right away.,5
com.textra,A Google user,I've used Textra off and on for years. I like that it's so easy to customize. Then only thing I miss from the default android messaging app is the ability to archive. Please add this option!!,4
com.textra,Raul Morales,"Guys, I've been using this app for the past 6 years, it has worked phenomenal. Today, after the latest app update, it deleted ALL my messages. please find a way to restore these. This is a huge mess up. Edit: I sent an email before this review, 5 weeks ago, and still I've not received a response.",1
com.textra,Adam Lee,"Works great and love the features, but I have noticed that I can not add a person into a group text conversation. The default messaging app on my Note 9 can do it. Why can't Textra do this? Update: this has been fixed and all works great!",5
com.textra,Jim Baker,"Been using Textra for years! Only one ""complaint"".... Are there any plans to increase the text blocking capabilities beyond blocklisting specific numbers? Being able to ""block numbers starting with *** would be a great addition and would end the numerous spam texts I receive. Other text apps that do this do not have the great texting features that Textra has. But one will be coming and I will be inclined to switch apps. Edit: Found an app that has the blocking filter I needed.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"My favorite sms app! I love the oled dark mode, crazy level of customization, and different options available like sending messages over 160 characters as an mms so the recepient doesn't get spammed with multiple notifications. I highly reccomend this app!! Try it!!!!",5
com.textra,My Self,"It's real power is the ability to multi select from the Search result and do the action like deleting (the only one). It's real down fall is (1) you can not archive msg's, (2) It is the Only program that you access Blacklist throuh Setting which does not make sence",3
com.textra,A Google user,"It's a really good texting app, I've had no issues using it at all. The only thing is it has ads after a while of using it, but they're non-intrusive and only appear above everyone's names in the list.",4
com.textra,Joe Pettignano,"Best texting app I've used so far. Love the customization aspect most of all from colors, sounds, icons and individual contact customization. I've tried the native Android messages app, Facebook SMS, and several others but Textra wins every time!",5
com.textra,Anon,"I would change this rating if there was a way to know which of the 2 sims in a dual-sim phone received the messages. Also no archiving feature yet. Edited rating. Still no archiving option. Also app icon vanishes frequently from home screen, specially after restart.",2
com.textra,Kayla Guidry,PRO User here as well... And same as other users recent issues. Not able to send out messages for somereason! It's extremely frustrating! Hoping for a quick fix & solution ASAP! Other than this recent issue. I absolutely love & appreciate EVERYTHING else about this app.,4
com.textra,A Google user,Very easy to use messaging app. Been using for four years now and haven't seen a better app out there. Love the interface and love how customizable it is. This one checks all the boxes.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"When you configured my textra app, you took my MMS away! Now, I can't even send pictures like I was before! I tried resetting through my phone settings with no way of changing! I even wrote down the steps to change the proxy, that didn't help, either!!!! Fix it!!! I'm hot mad right now!😈😡😠",3
com.textra,Willtendo,Has potential and a lot of neat features. My only complaint is that there's not many options to combat spam messages other than to just block the numbers which doesn't help much. It could use a phrase/word filter to block potential spam messages from people who aren't in your contacts.,4
com.textra,A Google user,Love this app. Super easy to use and customize. Recently deleted over two years of texts with my boyfriend and was trying every convoluted way to get them back. Then realized Textra had them all backed up and all I had to do was hit resync! Now I am 100% loyal to this app,5
com.textra,A Google user,Uodate Feb 9 2020 In settings shows a new version 4.23 but I can't uodate when I go google play store? Great app but I am still getting ads after paying for pro version.. would give 5 stars otherwise After some help from textra support I realized that the issue with ads was at my end. Other aps appearing over textra. I have changed my review to 5 stars due to excellent support and a great app that works much better than the samsung factory messaging app.,5
com.textra,Scott Wiltse,"Love the app, but for the past 4 or 5 months now. anytime I pull my notification bar down from the top of my phone and try to use the ""123"" button to add a ! Or ? It swipes the menu back up and I have to actually open the message to send the text... Really frustrating :(",4
com.textra,Samantha Conley,"I payed for the premium and even after a year they still haven't updated from Android 7.0 to fix MMS not sending. When I asked for a refund they told me to start sending them debug information. The subreddit for textra is full of similar issues, yet they stopped allowing posts 5 months ago, probably to keep people from publicly complaining. Don't buy the premium, don't download. They'll just lead you on until you give up, like me.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"I don't usually write reviews, but I've been using textra for years now, and I love it. everything is so customizable, it works well with my phone, and it is SO MUCH BETTER than the regular messaging app that our phones come with. HIGHLY recommend.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Good app, does what i need it to unlike my phone's default messaging app. I really like the customisation and the textrabot feature. recommend purchasing pro version as the adverts were annoying and it's a very small price to pay 😉",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I bought new phone. The basic message app disappeared. Cant find which one I had and loved. Only I am looking for secure none invasive sneaky when on same acctveith another. The time u want 2 send not present. Chat pops up cant dispose it for ever. Messages will not send lots of times Or I get late. Not good at all. I want basic. Share my photos, NOT have to keep checking to see if it sent msg. Awful!. Maybe your app should have as many others install with uninstall beside each other.PLEASE.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"At some occassions, the app fails to notify the user whenever new message comes in. Tried to re-install app multiple times but still it occurs. I've been using this app for four years now and it's kinda disappointing that this happened after I switched to a high-spec phone.",2
com.textra,A Google user,I have used this app for years and loved the customization for it. NOW I wake up with this new update and it is awful. I used to have my message icons customized to certain colors for certain contacts and now that option is gone. Time to find a new app i guess if these updates keep going down this road :(,1
com.textra,A Google user,"After two years of not using Android, Textra is still my go-to app for texting. I didn't even realize the other apps I was using were giving me grief. Ultra-customizable, fast, and so far free of the nit-picky things that always bother me - like setting MMS/SMS mode per group chat, or naming group chats.",5
com.textra,Aaron L,Great app but recently (since the last update I guess?) sending MMS messages has been very hit or miss. I will send a video or image and it will remain in the sending state for hours until it finally fails or sends up to 5 hours after me initially hitting send,3
com.textra,A Google user,"The GIFS will come up but won't send when clicking on them, nothing happens at all... Not sure what a happening but it's really frustrating to find THESE perfect gif and not be able to send it... Other than that its great!!",4
com.textra,Scott Bacon,Always great. Have been using it for many years. Always my first install on a new phone. Love belong able to customize each contacts messages from the ring tone to the colors and more. Few issues I've had were quickly addressed.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is by far, the best SMS app I've ever used. Absolutely no regrets having paid for the ad free version. This app is worth every penny. I had been having numerous problems with my default SMS app not receiving some texts. Since installing Textra, everything has worked flawlessly.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"1. When replaying back to a group message, it only reply to one in the group and it is the 2nd person in a group and non others in the group get the reply even the orginal sender does not get the reply. 2. I still do not understand why Textra can not give option to reply to recent contact, there is not tap for recent contacts when trying to compose a new message. Even though many of us have written to them about it. If these two issues are taken care off, I would give a 5 star.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"Usually love this app but for some reason it is not letting me send pictures to anyone. When I go to add the picture, it shows a box where the picture should be, except it's bland and then there is no send button.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Best texting app out there by far. No matter what other texting apps coming along, I always come back to Textra. Easy to use, so much customization on notifications, settings, displays and chats, hands down my clear favorite.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Freezes and locks up a lot. I'd pick another app but the only thing really left is Chomp and they're by the same owners as Textra. EDIT: I'm pretty positive it freezes up like that because its trying to load an ad. So its technically extortion to get people to buy the paid version.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"I install this on every Android phone that I get. It's customizable, easy to search through messages, and you can view conversation media like on iMessage (the native app on my phone didn't allow for this). Absolutely recommended.",5
com.textra,S. T.,"I used this app for one short month and was happy. But it stopped working. I simply wasn't getting any messages. I restarted, uninstalling, and spoke with my cell phone provider to reset the data. Nothing helped. I ended up uninstalling it.",2
com.textra,Alvea Koh,"I really loved the delay sending option. Also if you could add a bubble when there's a message like at the Facebook messenger, it will be so cute. Thank you so much. Sometimes I'm having a wrong send scenario. 😅",5
com.textra,Greg Waters,"Beautiful! I have been using Textra SMS for about 6 months and I love it! I would like to see a couple of changes though. 1) To be able to add more contacts to a group conversation, and 2) Be able to write the message and then add the contacts.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Loving the app. Only thing I would like to see added is when you send a group text, that message showing up in everyone's individual chat window. Right now that message is only visible in the group text window.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Unfortunately, it doesn't work with my number because whenever i senf one it says message blocking is active. I think that's because I'm out of data. I was definitely hoping that it would work on wifi tho. Other than T mobile phones sucking, it's really cool and i like the customization options!",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I mistakenly downgraded this app due to a misunderstanding on my part. Tech support was great and explained everything, and very promptly. I continue to be very happy with Textra, as I have for many years.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app, except I can't participate in group messages with iPhone users. I saw a fix online but it was way too complicated and required turning off other phone features. I'd love it if this worked out of the box.",3
com.textra,A Google user,Love this app. Have been using it for years. Super easy to customize for a colorful experience. One of my personal favorite features is that I can customize the text message icon for different people. Love love love this app!!,5
com.textra,Patrick,Excellent App! This app is so fluid with frequent updates. Even better when you upgrade to pro. Support is awesome too. Had a minor issue and Mandy was quick to send support and troubleshoot with me. Never will use another messaging program.,5
com.textra,Rho Goings,"I've been using this app for a few years now. It's reliable and not glitchy at all. The features are great, what's not to love! This app is a keeper! Also, A big thank you to Max and Jason, for quickly responding with a solution to my email regarding Google crashing this app and my other apps!!!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"love it. I like how I can customize each recipient with their own color text bubbles, and sounds. so easy to use, and better than the message system my phone came with. definately a wonderful app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is mine and my husband's absolute favorite app! We have no complaints, it makes everything easy to use, lots of emojis and colors to choose from. I will never use another texting app again as long as this is available. Ty Textra!!!",5
com.textra,Caleb Regan,"This is a awesome texting app! I was looking for one that could send scheduled messages, and this one is amazingly perfect! The app gives a huge amount of user control (settings, etc.) which I love.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I liked this app enough to buy the ads away, which is a big deal. One thing I would like to see is a minor feature edit. Please add the ability to add or remove numbers from an existing bulk text to avoid reentering all the numbers if i need to add or remove one number.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Grate sms app, extremely customable and well designed. The only downside I could find is when I turn on power saving mode on my Huawei P9, the default sms app changes back to stock. Maybe there is some way around this, but its not a big deal.. Anyhow, grate app!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Overall a great app with many more features than normal messaging apps. There are some minor issues with the app, but there is an easy to access support system with a diligent support team usually responding in less than 24 hours.",5
com.textra,Roger That,"Great alternative to default SMS app. Supports group sms properly and allows me to send more attachments with no limit (which carrier and default would not let send a lot of MMS - too big message all of the time). I like all of the options, really allowi g you to customise it.",5
com.textra,Richard Schmeichel,I was using this app a while ago but stopped because of to many issues. I have restarted after updating this app and using it for 2 months it has been working much better with no issues. Thanks Textra. Update: Like the improvements and flexibility.,5
com.textra,A Google user,It's lame that the ads pop up on the top where the new message is displayed. It is delayed so when you try to open the new message you click open the ad instead. Then you have to push the back betton after the ad screen appears to get back to your text page.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"Out of every texting app I've tried this is the most detailed one, personally I think the colors could be more eye catching. They could add panterns like preset ones, maybe rainbow or something like that. Just a suggestion! Great job Textra",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Part of why I originally purchased this app over others is because I could customise the colours and indicator light colour for different people so I'd know immediately who was trying to get in contact with me. But those features have since been removed, so now it's just another messaging app.",3
com.textra,A Google user,it's a great app! I love being able to customize the colors and individual tones for each conversation. the one additional thing that would make this 5 stars for me would be a web based platform as well!,4
com.textra,A Google user,"It continues to blow my mind (in a negative way) that the stock SMS app on my expensive Samsung Galaxy is so terrible and poorly designed. THANKFULLY THERE IS TEXTRA SMS, which hands-down is easily the absolute best and most impressive texting app I've ever known. Textra SMS is what messaging ahould be, and I do not understand why anyone would use any other SMS app. If you aren't using Textra SMS, then you're not texting. You're missing out. I don't work for Textra—I just absolutely love Textra!",5
com.textra,Connor Scaggs,I have been using this app for years now and it is awesome! Very simple to use and has a bunch of customization options. The free version has adds but I don't even notice that they're there. I prefer this texting app over any of the default samsung or provider apps,5
com.textra,Robert Glorioso,"I have not been able to send pictures, group texts, or single texts over a certain amount of characters. This has been ridiculous. I've reached out to tech support with no help. There has to be a fix. Its worked in the past.",1
com.textra,A Google user,I switched from Google's Android Messages app after some recent updates ruined it. Somebody recommended Textra so I decided to try it...best messaging after I've ever used! The customization is insane. I have NO complaints about this app. It's everything Android Messages should be.,5
com.textra,A Google user,The thing I really like about this app is that you can change the settings so that when you send a message out to More than one person when each person replies it only goes back to me instead of the whole group. I have not found another texting app that does that period,5
com.textra,Melanie Woods,"Overall a good experience, but since the last update, texts keep getting flagged and the app says they haven't sent even though recipients are getting them. No network issues. Seems to be app specific.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app! I haven't had any issues sending or receiving messages like I have with other apps. I ended up upgrading so I wouldn't get any ads and let me tell you what, it's worth the couple dollars spent. Job well done!",5
com.textra,Adam Moskowitz,"I would give it a 5 but I can't get the shortcut to have the notification number on it, yes I know it's in the menu bar at the top but an orange alert is a bit more obvious Edit: still using its fast and efficient, still can't give it a 5 star as there is no simple solution for a desktop applucation",4

com.textra,Jay Son,"Started using it a few years ago, paid for the premium version not long after I first started. Still using it to this day, however many phones later and I have zero complaints. Great alternative to your phone's standard texting app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Must Have! I have tried all of the more popular messaging apps and this is the pick of the bunch. Lots of great features (including Schedule SMS, which is great) and highly customisable too. Try Textra - you'll be glad you did. 👍",5
com.textra,A Google user,Fantastic app with a plethora of features. I have used Textra for years and have never been more pleased with a texting app. I have used a few others and each lacked the featires and customizations that are possible within Textra.,5

com.textra,A Google user,"Only text app that can blacklist text groups. Works great! if you have those people to keep including you in text groups and you want to get out of them, you can simply Blacklist the group without blocking the individual members. That is the single most useful part of this app",5
com.textra,Erik Riffle,I've been using the app for years and have absolutely loved it! First thing I install every time I get a new phone. Curious if you'll have a split view option for folding phones in the future. Great work everyone!,5

I am using SMS backup and restore to get my old messages on my phone - but during the time I am using that app, none of my group messages come through. So I'm losing messages I don't even know I'm receiving. Is that Textra or SMS Backup and Restore? Either way, I missed work texts, do we know if I can find them somewhere?",5

com.textra,A Google user,"Great free texting app 👍 Love the delivery reports, notification customization, personalized messaging windows depending on who you talking to. The ads aren't too annoying like other free apps either; you can definitely live with them.",5
com.textra,NO SYSTEM IS SAFE,The app is almost perfect. I just would like to have a comment on notifications. If it is possible please include an animation to the app whenever it receives new messages. A small number perhaps that would signify the numbers of unread sms without even opening the application Edit: From 4 to 5 stars .. Great customer feedback #maktub,5

com.textra,Spooky Kat,I love this. But you asked for a review at 4:35 in the morning and the notification woke me up I'm not happy. Otherwise the app is wonderful I use it a hundred times a day Only rarely the microphone doesn't work and I have to type in the first few words and then it will work again. I recommend it to everyone I know.,5

My issues is posted below I loved this app had been using it for about an year and have been a pro member but today's (12-8) has messed up textra for me.

com.textra,Bob Monkeypimp,Not worth paying money for. Incredibly basic & badly designed aesthetics. Edit: You do realise you have in app purchases don't you? You do realise the ad-free period is time limited? You also do realise that this has LESS features than the default Samsung SMS app & it looks like the aesthetics were designed by a child? You don't even have delivery notifications. Not. Worth. Paying. For.,1

com.textra,A Google user,Was fine until the most recent update. Now I can't send or receive texts most of the time. That makes this whole texting app useless. I'll be uninstalling and trying out Pulse sms until you guys fix your bugs. This is especially bad because I wasted money on the full version.,1

You should explain that the max file size for mms is 300k & that your textra service can't compress larger jpgs into smaller ones like default message service. No mes can do larger than 300k but the other can compress pics and mms yours can't. Confirmed by tpg!",2
com.textra,A Google user,Much better than the app that's pre installed on the phone. The paid version is honestly worth it. I love the add a GIF button and use it much more than I would if it were in a separate app that I had to copy/paste.,5

com.textra,JAMES BOND0077,So many things wrong with this don't waste your time. Fails to send videos on regular basis. Pictures that I've never taken or received have mysteriously appeared. That's very disturbing and means a major security problem/virus comes with this app..,1

com.textra,A Google user,This app has very nice ways to personalize each contacts color scheme. Also to personalize each contacts txt tone. I would like to see the app change the way a long txt fits into the box. When you send a long txt you have to scroll through a small txt block to proof read your txt. Also when you receive a long txt with normal font the txt is bunched in a small long window. It would be nice to see that long txt in a bigger window.,5

com.textra,A Google user,I love this app. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10. it doesn't allow me to set a specific notification tone for my text messages from different individuals but this app does. it was recommended by a representative of tmobile. I've been using it for awhile. I've recommended it to everyone.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"A wonderful texting app with many customizations. Clean UI and great quick compose options for texting. There are ads, but they ads are so unintrusive I forget about them, no popups at all. I will always use this app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I have purchased this app to remove the ads and I really like it. I would 💝 Love 💖 it if it had themes I could choose from instead if the boring bland backgrounds to choose from. I do enjoy the app, just wish I could customize it to my liking more.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"love the textra app. have only had it for about a month now. Today deleted text messages started to reappear, can't seem to get them to go away. emailed tech support hopefully they can help. I have the no add version",5
com.textra,A Google user,"love it...no problems Offer gifs & other fun things to use. My daughter got me started a few years ago, and we both still have the program. Highly recommend 😁 December 16,2020 Another review, again enjoying this app. I've never had any problems. I'll recommend it and keep using it. Thanks 😊",5
com.textra,A Google user,This is my go-to app. I wish I could find a way to have my texts read aloud without having to resort to the Google SMS app. i like the customization available. Friends love my customized text tones.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Fantastic texting app! I've been using it for 3 months and haven't had any issues at all. I love how I can customize almost everything in the app. I like things colorful, flashy and highly functional.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"i am usually very choosy about my messaging app. This one had everything i need. It is customizable, and runs smoothly. however, the option of customizing background should be added. apart from that, this app is perfect.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Disappointed recently......Been using Textra for a long time and have loved it. Super fast and totally customizable. Samsung did an update and now I can't get a text preview on my lockscreen. Very big deal to me....searching for a new app unless Textra can update and fix this????,4
com.textra,A Google user,I've been using Textra for awhile and I love it. One of my favorite features is scheduling a delayed text. I highly recommend this app. I've tried a dozen different ones and still chose Textra.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I used to really love the app, so much that I even paid to remove ads. However now I'm suddenly getting ads even though it says I'm a ""pro user"" which is getting frustrating. Otherwise its a great app that's way better than the default android messaging app.",3
com.textra,Martin Shackelford,Love this text messaging app. Hi especially love the ability to delay a text message to be sent later. All the colour customization etc is awesome. Just find myself wondering what level of security encryptio we have with this app. I haven't stopped to do my reading about that. Hmmm.,5
com.textra,Dumbbells and Diamonds,"I have a Galaxy S9+ and the edge lighting notifications used to work when I got text messages, but not anymore. Is it because of the One UI 2.0 update? Can you find out? Thanks! update: Works now! It was a setting on my phone. Thanks for your help, Jason and Mandy",5
com.textra,Lorna,"I like this app and understand with free version, I will have to deal with ads, but I still feel like I should be able to manage what kinds of ads I see. I just had an offensive ad pop up and there is no way to block or report it. Again, I understand the need for ads but I should be able to set my ad preferences.",4
com.textra,Joseph Gsell,"Love 💗 it. Delay to send. just 5 seconds back on time. Best feature. I've caught myself many times after pressing send, Stopping the Message cause I sent to the wrong person or needed a re-wording.",5
com.textra,Dan,"Just downloaded it and found out there isn't a category section. I find this very useful (available on Samsung's default app) since I can catagorize messages from friends to family to my company and others. Makes finding texts a lot faster and easier especially when running a company. Please make this available... And if it is, where do I find it? Thanks! I am going to keep this app (because it looks very promising), but not use it until a category section is created. Thank you!!",4
com.textra,Andrew Little,"It would be nice to be able to copy and paste certain parts of text within an SMS message rather than only being able to copy whole messages, making the app very inflexible. UPDATE Thank you!",5
com.textra,Stephanie,"I have used Textra for years, I just got a new phone and am not able to personalize text notification for each person like on previous phone. I'd rather have unique notifications oppose to personalized theme chat. Currently looking for app with text personalization option.",2
com.textra,Bill Prentice,"Good, but one HUGE feature missing - keyword spam filtering. It's something that has been asked for over and over but the devs always ignore that. Blocking numbers is as useless as the spammers just change numbers! Lacking that feature automatically costs two stars.",3
com.textra,A Google user,Excellent. Went pro. Worth it to avoid ads. Only thing is that I haven't been able to get it to show messages on the lock screen on my Huawei P20 Pro - but then neither does anything else. (Likely a feature of the phone or Android 9.),5
com.textra,Shari Rose,"The app has stopped leaving me notifications on my lock screen and home screen. Android system, all notifications are turned on in my settings. I think this is probably related to the update my OS did a few days ago.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I tried Textra four years ago as an alternative to the standard Messanger app that came with my phone. I purchased it shortly after. It seems to be very reliable and easy to use, and customize. I recommend Textra.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"It handles text messages. It's quick. Customizable colors. Dark theme. This is one of those apps you install, use, and get used to, to the point that a phone without it feels wrong.",5
com.textra,Linda Colleen,This has been my favorite text app. I always know who's texting with personalized colors and I can add personal signatures individualally. Even on the Free Mode the adds are streamlined and No evasive!!! It's Awesome!!!!,5
com.textra,A Google user,Differing notification sounds of texts from different people is the reason I purchased this app. I wish they would bring back the old sounds but I enjoy this app and I like that different people can be a different color of notification and a unique icon on my always on screen,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love this app but it has no sound. I have all of the notifications set but the only thing it does to let me know i have a text is wake up my screen. Edge lighting, sound and vibration does not work. love everything else about it.",3
com.textra,Geobear Nine,LOVE all of its customizability and the ability to rename group conversations. But I'm knocking off a star for the lack of ability to save all those customizations as a backup or for switching phones.,4
com.textra,Owen Graham,"Was not receiving incoming texts from certain people, when I set original messaging app back to default I had a mass amount of texts come in that I did not receive on this app. Videos and pictures would not be received by others on this app even though it said delivered on my end.",2
com.textra,Julie Frericks,"Not sure why this is happening. I don't see how I could be doing it, but in the last 2 days, after not hearing any notifications, I check, and 3 times now, my notifications for the app, and only this app, have been turned off to blocked.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Worth the premium price tag. However one issue I have is that MMS images when shared via email etc are sent across without a filename extension. So the recipient needs to save and rename to view. Minor but annoying.,4
com.textra,Ryan Clark,One of the best texting apps out there. My only problem I have with the app is the lack of a web interface. I would be willing to buy a premium version if a web version was associated with it.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"My carriers text app wouldnt let me have over 10 ppl in group txt, I was trying to find solution when Textra was suggested. I was blown away at how easy it was to install and set up. Does everything I needed and more.",5
com.textra,James Minshew,"Really like using it. Like the setup for scheduling texts for later time. Wish I could add or subtract contacts from a group without having to completely redo the group. Overall, very satisfied",4
com.textra,A Google user,"excellent replacement for the stock texting app. it is much faster and customisable. May I suggest making it another customisable option in which the profile picture of the person shows up next to each text, like they do on Instagram?",5
com.textra,Joy Henry,"This app is my favorite right now, it really works so well and has great customizations, I wish it were possible to like or love comments like iPhone texting app. It's a bit surprising the functionality isn't available. I'm definitely looking forward to new features in this app in the future and I hope the developer can bring us something if not equal to iPhone reactions or then better than iPhone reactions; Android certainly is the land of opportunity🙏🏾.",4
com.textra,Kevin Tomford,"I've been using Textra SMS as my preferred texting app for over 5yrs now and they just keep getting better! And while probably outside of Textra's control, I just wish the App could be assigned as the ""default app"" that opens on my Android / Note 10 while telling Bixby to send a text message!",5
com.textra,K Dykes,This app is pretty good so far. I would like be able to schedule when to send texts( different day & time like the app I had before. I really really miss that option. That's really the only complaint so far. Do you think it could be added??,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is easy to use and fairly customizable, which is nice. I would have given it 5 stars, but since switching phones (from a Galaxy to a Stylo), often messages don't go through and I have to retry sending them.",4
com.textra,Sarah Weldon,"I've been using Textra for a couple of years now and I love it! I love how I can customize the individual text notification sounds for all of my contacts, and I love the fonts and colors! It's such a cool app!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I love this app works great and you can customize each one of your contacts. Wish they would allow you to see when someone is texting you back or if they read your message. All in all it works great so far and I have been using it for about 2 months.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Exceptional product. Beginner?... You won't have Difficulties, just jump right in! For all the pros you just haven't given this an opportunity or haven't heard of it ,YET..

com.textra,t guy,"The Google issue totally altered my app but customer service gave me directions which for my phone were not possible but I could get to it a different way so I was able to customize my contacts. Great customer service, its a shame an Android glitch caused so many issues.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Great for texting, very fast/snappy. Only complaint is won't sent mms over WiFi, only text. Phone: OnePlus 7Pro. If this is fixed I'll switch back. (Edited post app developer response outlining the issue being due to Google Android changes that broke the feature I wanted).",5
com.textra,A Google user,I've used several text apps over the years. I always come back to this one. Currently using Pixel 3 xl because I found a deal. This phone has no LED alerts. Which blows and a customizable feature in Textra. Try this app think you'll be happy.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"My phone came with the Msg app from google. As I use my phone for work as well, I browse my txt conversations regularly, selectively deleting old, unnecessary and sensitive txts. In the past, I have always been able to select multiple individual txt in a conversation and delete them. The new Google app removed this ability, and you can only delete txt one at a time, or the entire conversation. This angered my a bit, as Google being Google, don't want you to ever delete anything. Textra Rocks, 🍺",5
com.textra,A Google user,i deleted the app on accident and when i downloaded it back all the numbers i had blacklisted are gone !!!! Some of those were very very important and there just gone now !!! They show on my original texting app but not on the Textra app !!! Please tell me you can fix this ☹️.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"I originally stayed with a five star reveriew, then to one because spam ads, then four for assistance limiting the ads, so there was moi spam , how ever it seems to be that there are no ads at all, but I just did this, so I'm not sure, this is not effecting the rating, I do find it slightly eritating that you can't save an unsaved conversation, or lable the Conversion, I do wish I could five this a four and a half stars, not because I can't, but because it won't let me",4
com.textra,A Google user,I like the fact you can change the bubbles for each person and the LED for each person you text. Well you can't change the LED on newer models because they don't have the LED. Still a nice app.,5
com.textra,Jeff Russo,"All has gone quite well... being able to customize colors and sounds for multi-person threads helps me to semi-ignore what I want to semi-ignore. I limped along with LG messaging app, but switched to Samsung and their built-in is bad, so, use Textra instead.",5
com.textra,Michael Johnson (Mike Johnson),"With rich features that work as advertised and several visual customization options, Textra is 95% of what a perfect texting app ought to be. That last 5% is only extra fluff, ""liked this"" reactions that are app to app specific. Textra has rich features for texting anyone.",5
com.textra,Connor Woods (Pseudonymous Colby),"Fantastic texting app with plenty of features and customization, responsive and visually pleasing UI, non-invasive ads (I honestly forgot they're there), and good customer service to boot. Must have for Android users",5
com.textra,Justin Wind,Switched to Textra after the latest Google Messages update rendered that app useless. Have not had one issue with Textra. Awesome customization features and I will not be switching back. This is the best messaging app out there.,5
com.textra,Karl Schuster,"Enjoy the customizations. Request: Can you separate out the text size adjustment from the contact circle icon size? Even at 100% text size, the circle contacts are too small and I don't want to make the text very large just to compensate to see a large contact circle icon. Thanks.",5
com.textra,Aiko,"I love you guys iOS emojis are why I stay. The color customization is great. Group texts work flawlessly. Picture messaging is wonderful. App works 100% how you'd want it to. Haven't quite figured out how to mark as unread, if that's possible (it should be!). Again, I love you guys.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Worked well when I first purchased pro version,a year later I constantly recieve temporary MMS or SMS problem notifications. Like 100 in a row! Gif or pictures don't send with multiple failed messages. I think it's time to find a new message app😒",1
com.textra,A Google user,I really like the customization options. The very best feature is that I can set up to a nine second delay when I hit send. So for nine seconds I can cancel it. Basically take it back.,5
com.textra,David Van Sickle,"Great app, been using it for years. The only issue I have found is that the Blocklist feature doesn't seem to work. I blocked a number this morning that was spamming me but messages were still coming through.",4

com.textra,A Google user,Rock solid messaging app. Love the delayed / scheduled send feature. Group messages make sense and can easily be muted. Ads are very unobtrusive in the free version (you can choose where they appear).,5
com.textra,Cynthia Fioriti,Absolutely incredible texting app. It lets you customize everything and the send delays are my favorite thing! I don't like the new pop up notification that's replaced the banner notification. Pop up just inconveniences my phone use..,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Textra is fast and easy to use. No glitches other than occassionally the keyboard hides text composition, but this happens seldom enough that the app is still efficient and worth the cost. Lots of color choices!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"The best texting app I've ever had. Easy to use, fast, smart, and so many cool settings. The ad free trial was great, but even the adds are non-intrusive. Love this app!",5
com.textra,Jake Pyra,"First off, I use an Android phone because I like to customize my UI. Secondly, I use Textra because it allows me far more customization than the standard message app. Easy to use, easy to setup for a minimal cost.",5
com.textra,William King,Interface is good and I especially like the 'delete' function. When a message has been selected for deletion the bin lid opens up but then waits for a confirmation tap on the screen....nice touch.,5
com.textra,john beach,"My phone came with gboard text. It was terrible. This app is simple, yet you can customize. I needed the option for extracting contacts to send out. This has it! Zero complaints so far.",5

com.textra,A Google user,Like the app would have given it 5 stars but it blocked the ability to send short voice recorded messages via SMS which had been introduced to the Samsung Note 9. Introduce the message recording ability and I will give 5 stars. Well it does have have voice memos. So 5 stars all the way!!,5

Perhaps I am doing something wrong... when I select share, I select in apps available, Textra but the Textra app is empty of the selected items in the typing area and options are empty ... i.e.the the items I selected to share are missing when I type the addressee... Sharing a text with pics and text and for me now (previously done by forwarding) is a major production, whereas before I could just ""forward"" it to the selected person and add or delete text and pictures as desired.... I appreciate the new send pics in share as email.... I have been a pro user for years and have never had a problem until the latest update early this month.. June 2021 It has been 5 stars for me up to now... ..

com.textra,Edward,I like the amount of features and customization. Very easy to block numbers. Will rate 5 stars if the following features get added: block multiple numbers using the first three digits and please add more 'sent' sounds like on the other app. Will edit review as I continue to use Textra.,4
com.textra,A Google user,I really do like Textra and all it features. But it keeps losing text messages from my friends and me. I get upset and delete Textra and come back for over three different times at least and it happen again. I am not coming back enough is enough.,2

They are not able to spy on our texts now. Enabling their stock app will allow them to spy on people and their messages. It's why I went with Textra. I can't stand Google. I don't use their search or Chrome anymore because they spy, just like Facebook and our government. Bet $1 million that you can turn off permissions but they will be turned on later!",5

com.textra,JS Wommack,I have enjoyed Textra. It works well & has a pleasant interface. My only complaint is that I wish when you receive a message that the drop-down notification would give more information such as sender & any security codes for logging in a website. That would be enormously helpful. Otherwise you have to leave the site you are logging in to & fetch the code. Sometimes that has caused my login to be disrupted & I had to start over. Other than that I've been very pleased.,4
com.textra,A Google user,I no longer have issues with group texts. No matter what platform others are using they get my texts. It is great for perosonalizing as well. You can pin a conversation to the top of this list which is nice as well.,5

com.textra,D. H,"Great app. Custom all ring tones and text message. If my kid texts, I know immediately its her. Only issue i find is I do not get Google notifications. Needed to log into Gmail and Google sends notifications, but I never receive them. Actually thought of uninstall the app for that reason alone.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I really love this app. My phone is older, so some of the more new apps do not behavior well with this phone. However, I easily see myself using this same app when I finally get a good phone. Quick and simple and full of tons of customizations while being so easy to navigate.",5
com.textra,Erinn Henry,Used to love this app!! Totally dedicated. But I guess there was a recent update and ever since then i have had nothing but issues. The app freezes up at 3 to 5 times daily. So annoying. Please help and or fix. Thx.,3
com.textra,Yashana Spruill,I have been using text for years but I now realize that the issues that I thought was my phone was actually issues with this app. First I wasn't getting text messages then I realized that my recipients was not getting my messages either. My text messages are really important and I need to get them.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"I really liked this app, until I had to pay for no ads or have the free no ad version. The ads are right in your convo list, and it's super annoying!! So I'll look for a different messaging app.",3
com.textra,Caleb Baker,"Edit: After the MMS problems were resolved, I have only ever had one or two such instances over the past six months. I enjoy the functionality and customization so much that I bought the pro version today.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Had this app for years, never had a problem. Honestly tried other sms apps and doesn't even come close to this one, i guess after a while it seems like this app grows on you and it doesn't even seem like an app but already part of your phone since the beginning ! If that makes sense",5
com.textra,A Google user,"like it except if you have a dual sim phone, the toggle to switch betewwn Sims is right next to send button. this is a horrible feature and daily errononeous sends from wron sim. should have option to move it or implement a push and hold to swap it so its deliberate, not accidental.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Very Nice app. I just downloaded this few days ago. It's a good messaging app. However, there were times it fails to send my scheduled messages on its scheduled time & date. I'm not sure why. Maybe, I should put a 5minute gap in every text... :) Overall, It's a nice & a good app!",5
com.textra,GM Blakemore,"With this latest update. I really like this app because I can block numbers when I need to (so far no limit), the colors for the test messages, I can see who's on the group text, I can call each member of the text, there are signatures, etc. but what I like most is the customer service. I have a problem and I thought it was with the app (it wasn't) but I received a quick response. I've had this app for years and still like it",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Uninstalled. It stopped sending MMS, images & emojis immed. after PRO upgrade. They say isn't related, but had zero problems until then. Fix instructions do not work & I'm tired of so much time and effort to fix it. It has cost me my relationship because he wasn't getting all my texts.",3
com.textra,A Google user,I downloaded this so I could get messages on android auto. Works wonderful for that. Get messages on my kenwood and it reads the message and can reply with ease. Don't like the display so much. Also hate the ads. But other than that I think its great.,4
com.textra,A Google user,Textra is a must have messaging app. it is sleek and simple yet so full of customizable options. The team is always prompt to answer any questions and offer suggestions. I have used it for years. Install it today. You won't be disappointed!,5
com.textra,Ashley Whittington,I've used Textra for a few years and it has mostly been without issue. Recently my messages have stopped sending and I don't receive all of my incoming ones. I pay for the ad free version so I'm not happy with this.,2
com.textra,Cheryl Richardson,"Love how I can email conversation threads to my email. Beautiful. Sometimes doesn't seem to work with the drop-down menu for receiving codes , so I default to the message app before I receive codes and then switch back to Textra.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"been using this for a while. best texting app there is. great interface, lots of features, very customizable. runs fast and smooth. gladly paid for the pro version.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I had to switch to Textra after Google refused to fix the Messages app bug on Pixel which crashed the app and wouldn't let me send txts due to a long-running conversation. Textra works great, it's fast and easy to use.",5
com.textra,James Wachsman,"Decent app, lots of features and customization available. Voice to text doesn't work as well as other apps, and recently texts randomly stopped coming until I rebooted my phone. Changed apps which fixed it.",3
com.textra,Fran Katz Greene,absolutely the most versatile program on the market for texting you can use multiple signatures on each text and change them on the fly. you change the appearance in more ways than on any other texting app that I've used I believe I tried them all,5
com.textra,A Google user,"5 bucks? Why not. after the trial, its 4 or 5 bucks, tired of my OP5T standard messenger, so i got this, although Pulse is free, no ads, just sayin. This has great customization, and honestly, 4 or 5 bucks really isnt that big of a deal, buy more than that at timmies every other morning.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"A must have, the app gives a load of customization features and is soo smooth. There's also a 2week no ad period but you can configure them to have them less nagging. anyway, this app is a must and considering about buying the no ad upgrade",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Love it. The add is not as annoying as I expected. Only wish that instead of customizing CONVERSATIONS, I could customize the CONTACT - so that all conversations with that contact would automatically use the customization.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"TBH I haven't used Textra in about 2 years. I switched to Google Messages because they have RCS. The reason I'm writing this review is because Textra truly is the better texting app. 100%. But without RCS, it's going to be vaporware. So please, please Textra team, do everything thing you can to get RCS compatibility. I know it's not 100% up to you. But still, you gotta get it. And when you do, I'll upgrade my rating to 5 stars.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I was having issues with Chomp displaying emojis and the developer suggested I try Textra to see if I had the same issue since they are ""sister"" apps. No issues at all with Textra. I love it! It is not as customizable as Chomp, but still looks great.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"The scheduled sms was not sent at the specified time. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Hit and miss. The UI is good though better than the default sms.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"By far the most simple yet elegant texting app out there. I enjoy the customization because I have sensitive eyes and I can adjust the colors of chat bubbles, background, etc to be more easy on the eyes and reduce strain. Love this app! 5/5",5
com.textra,A Google user,I've tried out several sms/mms and finally settled on textra. recommended it to my spouse when she went iphone-free. does everything pretty well and had some features I havent yet tried. makes out easy to text the family all at once. ty!,5
com.textra,A Google user,I have used this messaging service for well over 2 plus years and I love it. I've never had any issues with the app and the UI and look and feel of this app is great. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking to replace their standard messaging app on their phone. Thanks again Textra 😁,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Fantastic app that can be fully customized. I wish Google or whoever did not change the ability to have colorized notification icons, but Textra responded by making different shapes instead. I'm very happy with this app.",5
com.textra,Christina Davis,"Love this app. Makes customizing messaging so easy. All free, you can pay to not have ads, but the add is just at the very top of your message list, so not even noticeable.",5
com.textra,Seth M.,"The problematic issues are SMS & MMS messages don't go through sometimes, and if they do -it really takes quite a while. Pictures also get sent way out of order. I paid for the pro version to get rid of the ads, they're pretty bad.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"1. ""Auto close quick reply"" is off but still it closes after sending. 2. Whenever i choose a heads up button, quick reply doesn't appear. 3. When i clear unread messages on notification bar, icon badge dot also disappear so i have to open the app to check if there's still unread messages.",2
com.textra,Bleasin Roberts,Excellent Texting App. I love the customization options and the interface is simple. I would recommend this versus the stock messaging app. I use the ad supported versions and the ads really aren't distracting.,5
com.textra,Florin Matei,A very good texting app. Feature rich and very customizable. I'm using the paid version and the only feature I would like to see implemented is live chat (like iMessage and Google Messages recently). Overall a very good app.,5
com.textra,Jason Jongeward,"Textra is a fantastic text app, I did pay for pro version. I've used Google and Samsung text apps and didn't like either one. Textra offers a lot of customizable options and I've never had any issues with glitches like I did from Google's app.",5
com.textra,Cyril Smith II,I have used Textra now for about two weeks. I am very pleased with the way it works. It for sure meets my texting needs. It is a little confusing when Forwarding a text with more than one picture attached.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I've downloaded numerous texting apps because I hate the standard messages and I'm not a fan of messages+, this is by far the BEST app I've found. I've had absolutely no issues with it and really love how I can customize pretty much everything. Great job! Thank you for this!",5
com.textra,Alexis Kenny,"You get this app without ads for free for a month and then the ads come back, but they're definitely not as annoying as other apps. I've been super satisfied with this texting program!",5
com.textra,Narick Marfo,missing only 1 features and that is a lock option. Can be finger print or pin. First app i download or restore when i get a new phone. I like the dalay option when sending messages. There is so much more feature you can add. Overall good,5
com.textra,bevigrin,"I'd love to give more stars, but I can't find any instructions on how to get the best from it. I've tried and failed at many ways to delete multiple messages. I've also looked hard for ways to archive and retrieve messages. Nearly frustrated enough to give up on this otherwise great app.",3
com.textra,A Google user,LOVE IT! it's the best texting app EVER! i get friends to switch all the time. Being able to customize every aspect is THE BEST! & their customer service is AMAZING! I'll never switch!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've used textra for a few years now and I can't switch to any other SMS app. The customization is the best, and the quick reply option has come in handy many times. My only complaint is that it does not have the ability to search through your messages.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I like the app, don't mind the ads. have 2 complaints. when I get a text from you saying my text didnt go thru, it doesn't tell me who I sent it to. also, when I send a picture in my text, it takes forever to be sent",3
com.textra,A Google user,"It's the only text app that works once my phone does a weird update. Sometimes my phone updates and I can't send or receive multimedia messages, this is the ONLY text app that does when thay happens. So I just never stopped using it",5
com.textra,Jeanette,Went up a star for the voice memo ability :) Does the basic stuff. Able to assign colors to contacts and customize text bubbles. Major drawback is unable to send voice clips. Wish it had customizable background,4
com.textra,A Google user,This app is one of the best. Last update took away the notification color on the top of the screen that matched the LED color for each contact. Wish they would bring it back.,4
com.textra,Paul D,Textra is great! I have used it with every phone I have. The only issue I hate is receiving videos from a IPhone the videos are compressed and Textra doesn't uncompress them. I wish they would because what'sapp does uncompress them.,5
com.textra,Jonathan Dran,Used it for years and i loved it. Unfortunately they finally put advertisements. It wouldn't bother me (and i understand that developer need some revenue) but they put it on the top which makes it really annoying.,2
com.textra,Mel Wenham,Mostly good but one flaw drives me nuts. The new message dot notification won't go away. Read all messages. Marked them all as read. Driving me nuts. Apart from that good app. But not knowing when I have a new message is making the app almost unusable. Please fix asap,3
com.textra,Gabriel Alexis Dela Cruz,"Update: My textra is working fine now in MIUI 13 / Android 12 thank you so much for the quick response regarding with the issue im having. I'm Using this for almost 5 years since 2018 and still loving the customization and simplicity of your app. Especially the tech support is quick to help the user. Keep it up team textra! Will send an email if there is an issue, instead of updating my review here in google playstore.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is a really nice messenger app. The customization of colors is neat. It's very difficult to save it to the Google system so be aware your messages may"" be lost if you upgrade phones.",4
com.textra,Pierre Gagne,"Works great. The advertising bar is inconspicuous. Usually I pay to remove ads, but no need here. One thing I wish it had is a button that would allow me to call the contact directly from the Textra app.",5

com.textra,Naftali Budamba,"I've put 5 star but I'm tempted to start searching for another third party SMS app for the mere fact that after Update, you put a persistent notification on the screen for quick chat. I want a clean notification drawer unless there's an item I need to pay attention to. A to-do list is better on screen than a quick chat notification. I mean chatting is not even a time to time thing for anyone serious. Remove that thing that won't disappear even after disabling relevant notification settings.",5
com.textra,Gregory Namin,Still my go-to SMS and MMS app. I switched to a new phone and thought I had lost the custom notification sound feature. Mandy sent me instructions detailing how to get the custom tone back. I'm golden again!,5
com.textra,Sparky Cline,Great app! much better than Verizon's. Occasionally it will just randomly stop sound and or graphic notifications but usually re-downloading fixes that. It also moves very reliably and smoothly to a new phone!,4
com.textra,A Google user,I love Textra! It works so well and has wonderful personalisation features. I started using it so I could give personal notification tones to contacts after that was taken away in an Android update and I stayed because it's great.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I think I speak for most Android users when I say that what draws us to the operating system over iOS is the ability to customize every aspect of our experience without sacrificing sleekness or ease of use. Textra perfectly capitalizes on that by offering endless customization options with a sleek profile. I'm still waiting for the day when Android will support internet messaging like iMessage, but until that day Textra is really the best thing you could hope for.",5
com.textra,Kody Rodgess,"Great app!! I can customize everything. Including the icon on the home screen, very cool! Works smooth, and looks great with the right set up and maybe a SwiftKey?! Keep up the great work👏👏",5
com.textra,Anthony Kwamu,"Excellent app. Tried several, but this was the best. I only wish the group text can allow you to use just the default numbers of each individual instead of all the numbers for each individual. But great app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I legit love this app. it does absolutely everything I want and then 20 other things. You can customize everything. It's open. Best text app I've ever had. only thing I would request is ability to archive instead of just delete conversations.,5
com.textra,Thomas Hardy,I used this app for about 6 months and always had a problem sending photos gifs and videos. Switched back to my default messages app and it's working fine. Hope it get fixed soon cause I paid for the pro version.,2
com.textra,A Google user,I love Textra - I've had the PRO version for years but lately it's memory management has been awful. I have to resync it every day because it starts using almost 2GBs of memory! It is the only blemish on an awesome app.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"I've tried many other text apps and this is the only one that I can stand to use. not cluttered, easy, just the right tools and the right amount of tools and simple to navigate. the best in the bunch. Will always user this app!",5

It inaccurate on the homescreen. Otherwise, its great so far 👍🏻",4
com.textra,A Google user,"We switched to google fi network (worth it!) and needed new text apps bc of sending photos. Textra automatically resizes the photos depending on what network is being used. its easy, has the text me for help bot! and nice to personalize. Keeping this one!",5
com.textra,Shredd Pool (DeadPool),My favorite texting app. Only thing I don't like is the ad at the top looks too much like a message. Click it by mistake too often. Thank you for prompt solution to my problem. Upped to 5 star!,5
com.textra,Ron Homer,Works excellent but would still love to see a feature that would only allow messages from members in your contacts and reject or send a canned reply to all others. (A reverse block listing feature.) I'd certainly donate again if that were added somehow.,5
com.textra,Laurel Sanders,"Great response time when emailed Textra help for help with the following issue: Unable to send or attach Google Gifs with Textra. No issue sending Google GIFs in other message apps e.g. Signal, Whats App, Messenger. ISSUE RESOLVED quickly and effectively. Thanks Textra help! Textra fully functional again. Great Service! Great App!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Shows contacts sorted by first name only (not the sort order i specified in my contacts app which is by last name). I like to swipe not type whenever possible, so I found another app that does what I need. Nice app in every other way tho.",4

I bought a Galaxy S22 and have been using Google Messages. I've beem sold on the idea that it's the way forward, RCS etc. But there's just some things I don't like and I found my way back to Textra. Hope RCS is coming. Keep doing what you're doing.",5

com.textra,A Google user,I loved this app AT FIRST. But now I frequently can't send photos or even a GIF. With all the restrictions for size and data limits completely turned off the app SHOULD have free range to send whatever. But noooo.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Best messgae app. The more you use it, the more youll see. I initially got it for the color change (dark theme) and it was just fine, even with ads. They havent bothered me to this day. I think this app is delicious, as it suggests on the Play Store",5

com.textra,A Google user,"oddly enough, my OnePlus 7 pro did not have a texting system installed that came with a date and timestamp. The one that came with the phone seems pretty generic.

com.textra,A Google user,Been using the app almost a year now with no problems til yesterday. I have myself as a contact in my phone and pinned to the top. Textra not only unpinned my contact record but it deleted all of my texts to myself. Countless messages of important things to remember... links... things for my business. I re-pinned my contact record today and sent myself a text and textra unpinned me again and deleted my texts a second time. I am uninstalling this app.,2
com.textra,Nick Montaleone,"Has most of that I want in a messaging app (except for an online / computer application and ""mark as unread""). You can schedule messages and it has many other great features. I recommend this above most other mesaging apps.",4

com.textra,A Google user,App gives me options to individualize sounds for contacts. Only thing I don't like is that you can't enlarge text from the screen like you can everywhere else. I'm aware you can enlarge text in settings,4
com.textra,Tabitha Auton,This is the first thing I download on every new phone. It has every feature you need for texting. Love the customization. The only issue is I can't remove or add anyone to an established group text.,5

com.textra,Redbone Perez,Love this text app cause it has a delayed text option incase you change your mind of what you are saying or who you are sending the text you got 10 sec to not send it is a life saver when I'm arguing with the Boo 🤗 .Plus it has a lot of extra things I love that I use . The best text App ever ❤,5

com.textra,A Google user,"I love Textra and all the customization it has. Few concerns that force me to give it 4 stars and not 5... 1. Why is there not a way to ARCHIVE a message, rather than deleting it? Sometimes, I want to swipe off the screen to archive a message (aka Google Messages), and bring it up the next time i converse instead of deleting the message just to get it off the screen. Deleting the message removes all history with that contact. 2. All new unread messages should be highlighted someway to show it is new. Please make this happen textra!!! There hasn't been an update since November 2019... 3. I have missed several group messages during the holidays... not sure if it is my phone (1+6 on Tmobile) or if it has to do with Textra. I have missed other group messages and MMS. This may be a larger concern for me than the other 2...",4

com.textra,Kelsie M,"would really like to leave a 5 star review. Unfortunately, some of my favorite features have been taken away (I think this is actually Android/Google's fault). Ex.: custom vibration patterns for contacts, custom blink color for contacts. Very disappointed that these features are gone.",3

com.textra,A Google user,i like the layout and customization with it. the features are convenient like how fb messenger has chat heads to open when you are in another app you can also reply to a message without opening the app. i would give 5 stars if i was able to remove the permission notifications i get like 10 times a day. i have allowed the app to access contacts but my phone will notify me that textra has used contacts. no idea how to stop that wothout deleting the app,4

com.textra,EvaLynn P,Such a great texting app. I can't count the years that I have used it for. I had no problem paying the small price to use it add free. It's constantly updating with improvements which make the app better and better every time.,5
com.textra,Marcie R.,I use to use Textra all the but SMS got better so I've been using it for a while.A clear video I sent on SMS was blurry & sound distorted so I was going to switch to Textra (I like trying different apps anyway) but when I opened to send a video clip like a TikTok or Snapchat video thru Textra the option wasn't there. It appears that videos can't be sent on Textra so I went back to SMS.,2
com.textra,Chris Smith,"Works well. Should say it's NOT FREE up front, as I would not have installed knowing that and it's a 3 because of this. Free period is up and don't want ads. Couldn't figure out how to make call from app like I can with that other app.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Best texting app by far. Didn't expect a ""VIP"" service, but the free version isn't bad whatsoever. I would recommend for people who: • Don't like how their texting app looks • Make texting personalized Takes some time to get use to, the first few days seem bad, but after some getting use to there's no going back. Please, give this app a try!",5
com.textra,K Lindsay MacRae,"Got this app because my messenger was not working properly. I like it so much that I paid for the upgrade . . .and being Scottish, spending money is hard for me. I would def recommend it to everyone. Here I am, over two years of daily use since 2019. Textra hasn't let me down once. It's the best around and so inexpensive to go Pro. Get it! It's the BEST.",5
com.textra,Keith Meehan,"I've been using Textra for probably 3 years or more. I love it, it easy to use. All of its features are layed out perfectly. I really like how simple it is to program a text to be sent at a future time. Great app. Keep up the good work 👍",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is the one SMS app I always install first whenever I get a new phone. The UI is clean and easy to look at, it's easy to use, and there's a fair bit of customizability to boot. Highly recommended!",5
com.textra,Aaa Zzz,"WARNING Textra deleted all my text messages in Amdroid 10. Two simple Android 10 swipes to minimize and display running apps, and Textra selected six years of SMS texts and permanently deleted them with no confirmation prompt. If you are using Android 10, DON'T INSTALL IT!",1
com.textra,A Google user,Love how customizable it is. Sometimes the sequence of texts gets mixed up but unless you're doing marathon text sessions and no one has a sense of humour you should be good. Been using this app for 4+ years. Love it overall.,5
com.textra,John K,"I dont.know what's going on but lately all my text messages are failing to send what the heck is going on 4/28/21- Follow up.... So far the rating is well deserved While I did get a quick response from the CS team. I'm being told it's an AT&T issue.. That AT&T needs to.make an update... I followed up with the question "" Do I have to notify or is someone from your group have a contact at AT&T you deal with? Which now 4 days later I haven't received a response. The rating stays as is",1
com.textra,A Google user,Hands down the best messaging app available for android. I have tried them all over the years and i can't say enough good things about Textra. The only downfall is there is no support for my android watch.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I am giving it a 5 because it absolutely let's me do what I want. I can send a text message to a group, the recipient does not know it is a group message and I get individual responses. I am having difficulty adding and subtracting people to and from a group. I really need to spend more time figuring everything out.",5
com.textra,A Google user,i wanted an app that had more customization than the stock galaxy s8. this one lets you change the highlighter color on your texts. and vibration patterns... eh i would have kept the app but it asked for money and threated ads. I dont see the value.,3
com.textra,A Google user,Great texting app. No WiFi necessary. Works better than the text app my phone came with. Ads are not bothersome. Just an ad at the top of your contacts that you can click on if you're interested.,5
com.textra,Frank Cordie,I really like Textra. I have used it for a few years. The only problem I have is of late I have lost much of my historical texts. I have downloaded other apps and those texts from the past show up but they are not in my Textra app. I have uninstalled the Textra app and reinstalled the new Textra thinking it might help but it did not.,4
com.textra,IROKRUOK 2,"Since last update textra has and still is deleting hundreds of my texts. Tried to re-sync but they are all permanently gone. It's random, not every contact effected the same. What happened guys this was my favorite texting app. I can't keep using it anymore.",2
com.textra,Robert Cable,"Been using Textra for years now and I'm still very happy. It has lots of features that make managing media and messages very easy, plus I love the look. I highly recommend getting this app!",5
com.textra,A Google user,This is best text messaging app.. there is only one problem that is ad. But it's ok there are not too much ads😅 means it's not annoying because there's only one block at the top of textra every time ads displays in that so it's not disturbing🤗,5
com.textra,Antonia Von D,Hi team I updated today to your most recent versionand I no longer have any custom notifications or notifications except for the LED and when I wake up my screen manually. I dont have the screen wake up or the phone vibrate anymore when I receive a text . Please fix this bug!,3
com.textra,A Google user,Great for personalizing conversations! Only con (which is not their fault) is it isn't compatible with my Samsung watch. I still get texts through notifications but can't respond or reopen.,4
com.textra,Bryan Kasper,"I've used textra on my last 5 galaxy phones so probably the last 5 years or so, I have the pro version which Is well worth it to me, the app has never given me any issues, works great, great customization if that's your thing. Just download it, it's better then whatever came on your device I promise you.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"App allows me to participate in group messages, which is great since the Xiaomi default messenger app does not. The only issue is the notification sounds don't seem to work. *update fixed the notification sound issue with developers advice. Thanks!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I enjoy this app but the only thing, and this is a feature request, is the ability to read a message on my garmin watch. I get the notification but it doesn't actually display the message. Sounds like a partnership/integration avenue between the two companies.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the customizability, its smooth, runs great, no problem transfering contact and existing conversation threads. Very customizable! And it has a voice memo option in settings! This app does not disappoint!!",5
com.textra,Katie L,Love this app. So many features. Love that you can customize the notification badge to only show the contact and not a preview of the message. The support at textra is quick and friendly. Highly recommend this app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Textra beats everything else. Has all the features I like & looks great especially in dark mode. There are adverts in the free version but a couple of bucks solves it all ... Cheap !! Great !!,5
com.textra,Chloe Fleet,"This app works really well and I'm satisfied with it! I really like the option to change your theme, bubbles, and even emoji packs haha! Downloading this as a replacement for my default one really was a good choice on my part. :)",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Works very fast, but the app details boast having a wide range of features and is lacking basic features such a searching text within a conversation. Hopefully we will see it changed soon in an update.",3
com.textra,A Google user,I love this app! I love how you can change different colors for different people and its easy to delete messages. I also how you can send and receive pictures without waiting. I'd recommend this app to anyone. Thank you to whomever published this app!,5
com.textra,Warner Young,"Works great as a text app, but I have 2 issues. 1. On Android Auto, I always get notified twice for each text. 2. I'd rather stay with this app, but I wan my to take advantage of RCS. Any chance of adding RCS support in the future?",4
com.textra,Aaron B.,You ruined the app. Latest update puts mandatory underlining and app linking on dates and times. That's exactly the reason I switched from Samsung's messages app. At least make it optional?Samsung messages can send pics and text in one MMS vs. an MMS and SMS.,1
com.textra,A Google user,I absolutely love this app. Never had a problem at all. I like the fact that it tell you who is calling and sometimes pictures and Facebook access if they are using the textra app. So I would recommend this apo to everybody. I have tried a lot and I was satisfied with this one.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Love the app but I keep missing random texts - I'm not getting the notifications for them and I only notice a week later when I manually go and check. Add the option for a reminder vibrate if there's an unread message or something like that please.,4
com.textra,Harold Collins,"Extremely reliable and amazingly customizable app. My wife and I have been using Textra for the last three phones each of us have had, and will continue to do so. Yes, it's that good.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Very nice and fluid...the adds aren't too bothersome at all. The only thing I would like to add is a ""search for in this conversation"" feature, rather than having the app search every conversation.",5
com.textra,A Google user,The app works really well for most things. The only thing that I don't like is that if the message does not send it asks you if you would like to retry vut if yoy are not paying attention it hust goes away. There should be a war ing next ti the message in the thread saying that the message did not send.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Developer keeps up-to-date with stability and feature improvements. This is, by far, the most customizable and useful text application in the play store. Totally worth the money.",5
com.textra,Karen Sjoblom,"I was having problems with my phone-provided texting app receiving photos, so I researched the issue and learned it was likely due to that app. I switched to Textra after reading the reviews and have had no issues.",4
com.textra,Michael Bui,Have had textra paid version for 3 years now and only used this because it supported custom notification sounds for different contacts. Unfortunately after the new update this feature is no where to be found anymore and my custom sounds no longer works.,2
com.textra,Kimberlin DaSilva,"I've been looking for new texting apps since 2010 I swear. I'm super fussy with my notifications and the way texts look etc, this checked all my boxes when it first came out. I bought premium in 2016 and never went back!",5

com.textra,Brittany Cipriotti,Love this app. Customize everything down to colors and shapes. I originally started using this because my text quit letting me customize text tones for each notification. I have a diabetic daughter and wanted her ring tone and cgm alarm to be different.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Been using this app for 7+ years on several different phones. Now I rarely receive MMS messages. Just recently, I tried to send a normal text to an iPhone and it won't send. Unfortunately having to uninstall.",1
com.textra,Chris Lally,"Works great, Textra helped me though an issue. If you have problems with Textra removing attachments at the end of text messages, it is caused by the Samsung keyboard. Easy way around it is to install and make default google keyboard, or gboard",5
com.textra,A Google user,Great alternative to Google Messages - especially after the Android 10 update jacked up my Nokia 6.1 and I couldn't get text notifications even after hours of troubleshooting. Thanks for something that works and so far works well.,5
com.textra,Jomar Delima,Are we now not able to use custom notification sounds? I no longer see that option under Customize Notifications > Notification Sound in Textra. I can set it through my phone's settings but it will still use one of the default notification sound of Textra. Oppo A92 user here.,4
com.textra,Silvy,"I would rate it 4-5 stars, but I just discovered it has ads. My mistake for not seeing it, but I see ads literally everywhere and I don't want it in my text messaging. Great while it lasted. Deleted.",2
com.textra,Melanie Kyle,"Love the customizations but too often I get a ""failed to send"" message for SMS and/or MMS. Thought it was my phone, but a new phone and carrier has the same outcome. Textra tried to solve the problem, but couldn't.",3
com.textra,Connor Menges,"UI is very smooth and well designed, but unless I ""force quit"" the app every time I'm done sending a text it demolishes battery life. My phone went from lasting at least all day to lasting no more than 3 hours after downloading Textra.",3
com.textra,Mario Cunningham,"I really like it as it is very user friendly. It takes some getting use to at first but again very user friendly. I didnt like that I had to upgrade to the full version of it in order to continue using it uninterupted but for the price, I'd say its worth it so far. Also I forgot to mention its very customizable.",4
com.textra,Pete Notaro,"Loved this app until my company switched over to Google Enterprise for all Android devices. Now I can't access the contacts in MaaS360 since it's now partitioned. Using Google Messages since, which works. Please fix! *Updated 5/28/20* After going back and forth via email, things went quiet. Is there a fix for this?",3
com.textra,Andrew Elder,"I. general, I like Textra, but it lacks a few core features like being able to react to someone else's message. Also, hasn't solved the issue with image quality when sending between Android and iPhone.",3
com.textra,A Google user,I like being able to customize my conversation colors. This is a fun feature for those of us who get bored easily. I also noticed that help is available just by posting any issues in this review area. I will recommend this app to my friends.,4
com.textra,Cathy Jackson,"I love the easy if use, the ability to design and structure it in a manner that works for me. The only thing I wish it had is the ability to leave voice messages instead of text messages but it's the best sms app I've used to date.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I have really had any problems with the app. Although, if I want to send a Bitmoji, I have to close this app, open the Bitmoji app. Then when I select the Bitmoji I want to send, I have to selext the Textra app, type in the persons name to send it. And I can only send 1 Bitmoji at a time. Didn't have this issus with my the phone app, so not sure where the issue is. Also wish I could customize the background with a pic or wallpaper. Aside from that, the app works fine.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"I got this app because of the update from Samsung, that removed individual text notifications. This app has everything I'm looking for but, it doesn't always work, especially with sending pics, vids it gifs.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"My phone's native text app doesn't allow group messages for some reason, so I got Textra to get this capability. It works great, simple to use, and I also prefer the color scheme to the native text app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Pretty dope app! I'd been looking for one that let's me send gifs cuz for some reason my LG g7 thinq wouldn't do it on the default messaging app and even though this was the first one I tried, I don't feel the need to try anymore out. It let's me do exactly what I wanted in a messaging app so I give this thang 5 stars! Whoever developed it, personal thanks bro hella came thru hahaha Update: the group messaging actually didn't work for the first group message someone initiated but it started working on the second one sooooo ✊",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Does what it says it will. I would like it more, if it was able to give me an audible warning when I changed from SMS to MMS and it added the ability to change the sound it makes, when you send a text.",5
com.textra,Aaron McDonald,"I've upgraded to the pro years ago but I get false notifications. The icon will pop up on my screen & when I open it, there's no message in the box. Thx occurs at least a half dozen times every day",3
com.textra,Hansani Archibald,Notification Dots are not showing up on the App Icon even after Turing on in phone and app settings. Restarting got it to work briefly. I use a Surface Duo. Also folding phone/dual screen optimization would be an awesome update.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I really like the customization abilities of this app. It's very well done, I had switched over to it after the default Android app cut out all customization and I am happy with that decision. Only thing I wish the app had was a widget like some other texting apps",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Having an issue where the app sends texts that I didn't write to people in the middle of the night, while both of us were sleeping. I've switched to stock messages until that gets sorted out.",2
com.textra,ET W,"This texting app is better than the actual stock version of the android texting app. Very customizable, feature rich, and a very useful app. Unfortunately though it allows for email to text spam. I get an overwhelming amount of txt spam in a single day.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"My son recommended Textra when I spoke about wanting a more customizable sms app & promptly began using it exclusively. Textra allows for a (nearly) thorough personalized UI experience ...""nearly"" because there is always more that 'could' be done.",4
com.textra,Brandon McMichael,Amazing texting app and easy to customize! Free to use(if you choose to)and the ads aren't even the slightest bit intrusive if you decide not to pay to get rid of them.,5
com.textra,Cal El,"Why did you take Wi-Fi fix off? That was a very useful feature, now some MMS messages take an hour to be received and you can only tell because the fail to retrieve Notification... Bring it back... Realized this isn't your fault but Google's, thank you for the reply and explanation, still using the app ✊🏾",4
com.textra,A Google user,This app is near perfect but can't do something very basic. Can't add new contacts to a group sms if I did not include the contact first time when sending the sms. That's why I have given a 3 star rating.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Has all the basic functions, and some really cool features! You can let the app choose a color theme for each conversation which I love. Very customizable and very easy to use!",5
com.textra,A Google user,Textra gives you extra... Highly customizable and a fair sendable file size unlike many other messaging apps who've chosen to shrink sizes down rendering them virtually useless. I don't mind paying for great apps but I do like to try before I buy.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Definitely my favorite texting app. The UI is easy and logical. Customizing the look is a huge plus. I'm using it on a rooted pixel 2 with apex launcher and SwiftKey keyboard. It's a great combo.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Just started using the app today - its real nice . I mainly got it to solve this issue with my MMS messages showing up with a ""subject: no subject"" line on my default text app. Textra completely got rid of that annoying issue... awesome! Thanks!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Best by far... The only thing missing is the ability to message thru a desktop. With so many phone loosing the notification LED its nice to be able to custmize thr notification icona and chat colors. Been ising rhe free versikn for a couple years, you dont need to upgrade but it really is a gteat app.",5
com.textra,R. M.,Textra really is a very nice apk. But there is no option to add some messages to Archive. Also it would be more interesting if you could add the ability to organize different messegaes to different folders.,4

com.textra,A Google user,Absolutely awesome!!! This app hits the nail on the head when it comes to texting!! I have found themes i LOVE but never purchased in the app store due to the text mesages having a bright background which hurts my eyes. This fixes that!! Thank you!!!,5
com.textra,Nelson Brites,The app is really easy to use. The feature to color code each contact makes it easy to identify which chat belongs to who. Plus it save received images in a separate location so you can choose which images to keep,5
com.textra,A Google user,I love this app. Its crazy how much u can customize. But theres one thing missing that I would like to see here. You should be able to change the backgrounds in the text message windows. That would make it perfect. It would get it 5 stars.,4
com.textra,Tara T,"After a few weeks app stopped sending messages. Updated it, uninstalled and reinstalled, and still did not work. It was great when it worked. Wish it stayed working.",2
com.textra,Stephanie Greenwood,Love the app but please fix it where it's not quite so easy to delete an entire contacts conversation. Bout had a minor heart attack when the messages all disappeared by accidentally hitting a button. Other than that it's perfect,4
com.textra,Gabriella Arroyo,"Love this text app but have 2 complaints, fixing these would give 5 stars. #1: no way to mark texts as spam. #2: copy paste doesn't always work, it often copies the entire message instead of allowing you to select text. Using Samsung flip .",4

com.textra,Alex C,Nice and simple but needs a setting for a pop up feature for the lock screen so i can reply without having to open my phone then open the app then open the message just to reply to someone like you can do with next sms. Also needs the setting for the ability to pop up over the home screen and other apps automatically for the same reasons.,3

I can switch modes in the conversation if I notice, but I don't always notice. I'd like a feature to state that I am about to reply in Bulk mode to a group msg.",4

com.textra,A Google user,Hear me out. I LOVE this app. had it for a couple years but one day it bugged out and made my phone unable to send text messages at all. I had to factory reset my phone to get it to work again. So I gave the 1 star for the stress I went through and I'm scared to get the app again now,1
com.textra,A Google user,One of the best app for SMS. Just need a feature of scheduled text. Means sender just set the time at which he wants to send the text and app automatically sends the message on the time that was set by the sender. Please add this feature on the app. 😊,5

com.textra,Daniel T.

That would be cool.",5

com.textra,Stephen B (Critical Tinkerer),Been relatively happy with this app except that in the last 6 months or so the shortcuts disappear on a regular basis. I have to go find it in the all-apps screen and re-create shortcuts on my home screen and shortcuts bar.,3
com.textra,Mel Griffiths,I love how customisable the app is but I can't send screenshots or photos as I get an error message. I can't use the goggle keyboard gifs as I get the same error message. Very frustrating. Thinking I'll just go back to the standard Samsung message app.,3

Also now to correct words that Google voice doesn't get right I have to back out of voice recognition and tap on the msg to get the keyboard back up. Previous to Google you could just tap the msg and the keyboard would have come up. I would give five stars. Not now. Please switch back to the better voice recognition.,1

If you paid to remove ads that's all you paid for. You're not paying monthly for specific requests or features you are paying to remove ads. That's it.

com.textra,A Google user,"Hey Textra team! I am having troubles sending out Media with this app. Could you point me in the right direction as to how to fix this? My phone plan is virtually unlimited in terms of how many/what texts I can send. Otherwise, I love this program! Hope we can come to a solution. Thanks for your time",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app, streamline and easy to use. Great user interface and very customizable. Puts the stock Samsung messaging app to shame. Only thing missing is location sharing, other than that it's perfect.",5
com.textra,ari sweet,"Been using Textra since 2014. I love it. I'll never use any other text app if I can help it. It keeps coming with me every phone upgrade! I love the font options, the sleak look, and the color customization. Even my 60+yo mom decided to keep it when I gave her my old phone! I haven't paid yet but I DO intend to. Ads are so inconspicuous that they haven't made me feel pressured to like other free apps do. Pay for it if you can. Worth it! Update 12/10/2020: Officially a paid user now!! ❤️",5
com.textra,Moe Azizi,"Customer service doesn't exist any longer. You have a problem, don't count on them to help you. Been texting them every other day and they simply ignore you. Plus, say goodbye to group texts arriving and sending in timely manner. People tell me they get my texts a day later and I don't see theres for hours or day later as well.",1
com.textra,John McKinnon,"Good app that works faster than the Samsung messenger and Google's. Can get heavy on storage but a delete data seemed to correct without loosing any pictures or anything. Like the ""pop out"" feature when texts come in.",4
com.textra,Briar Rose,Textra was Great at first but now it's having some issues. Textra won't receive messages anymore unless I restart my phone then all the missing texts come through. I've tried updating the app and it's still the same,2
com.textra,Ian Macdonald,Great I can add identification to my texts to avoid any confusion with my name. There are 4 of us with the same name but slightly different spelling. The addition of a footnote to all texts has eliminated this point of confusion.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love textra so much! But can you make Textra a chat head? I would appreciate it so much. So that when you go out of the app, the chat head is still active and you don't have to go open the app, just the chat head ❤ And also, the notification sound, I like to make my notifications' sound from my files, not as the default only :( thank you for making my suggestion.",4
com.textra,James Miller,Nothing stands out about this app. Handscent still beats it on about 70 levels. And there is no floating text popup or prepop bubble like the pictures show. Felt like. Rather dull app to be honest. Didn't add anything my stock lgv60 app didn't already have.,1

com.textra,J Schroeder,Scheduled text is a life saver. Also like how customizable this is. The ads are very unobtrusive. So I didnt bother paying for premium. But maybe I will since they've given us such a good app. Thank you!!,5
com.textra,Othniel Hinckson,The best texting app thst I have used. The features are very good. Customization is a plus. I really like the send delay feature it has helped me from sending something wrong by accident.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Well made, been using for years. -suggestion; It would be spectacular if I could reply to messages via my laptop, and having those messages sync within some kind of server so I could read messages from my phone that I've sent through my laptop. Keep it up! Thank you.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"I would love to give this app a 5 star rating but sadly I cant. The reason for that is, I am not getting notifications while I'm using my phone.

I can also turn off the ringtonw for certain groups or people without affecting other settings. I can also assign different colors to people and or groups. I can also import ringtones from ringtone apps... Very easy to use. I have a samsung A51and I couldn't assign different ringtones to groups nor could I turn off ringtones to only one group - all were affected. . Am so glad I use TEXTRA over the one that came with my phone",5
com.textra,A Google user,I'm absolutely loving this app. It's everything I've been looking for in a text app and more. Hopefully it will have more and better free theme's soon. I changed mine three times already just today.🥰 I only gave four stars because it says it's free but in order to have everything it can do you have to pay for a membership and pay. ☹️,4

com.textra,A Google user,Loved the app when I had it until people began telling me they sent messages that I'd never received and being embarrassed when they showed me. The features and customization are great for UX but it was disheartening to know I missed out on events due to missed messages.... Thank goodness there wasn't an emergency text missed,3
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the app, in is a really good texting app. The only trouble I have is the voice over is not very accurate, But I am not positive it's the app for my phone . Although I do have a Galaxy note 10 and it should be a good phone. Just purchased it recently.",4

com.textra,A Google user,"I really like how Textra is able to flawlessly deny those messages from a single individual or group chat, but still accept others. Nicely done! My question is this: Is there anyway of displaying not only the Name but also the Phone Type. On my phone I have several numbers listed under a single Company name. When I get messages from these individuals, it would be nice to not only see the Company Name, but also the phone type (which in this case happens to be a persons name) in the Header bar, otherwise all I am seeing is multiple Company names, but no Name (which is the phone type) which gets really confusing. Is this something I can set on my own or is this something that needs to be implemented within your app? Thanks",5
com.textra,A Google user,Excellent app. Solved my messaging issues even when going through endless hours troubleshooting with both my carrier and Samsung. 1-22-20 Update! Still using this excellent app. Works better than anything I've used including iOS. Thanks much for sharing this with us.,5

com.textra,Roi,Used google messages for year's but it had started giving me trouble not sending messages it would say sending for days but never send. Textra so far works flawlessly. So far I like it better It literally does everything the other messaging app did but better in my opinion.,5

com.textra,dalton langlois (BalancePointKid),So flawless for me a actually came rate it. It asked me if it was working for me and figured it's been working so well that I can come give it a review.

com.textra,A Google user,"I really love this app. I love how you can change the background and I love my ringtone. I only gave it a four because it doesn't let you toogle between two peoples texts. You have exit and go back in to answer the second one. Other than that, I love it.",4
com.textra,Melanie Braga,Textra has the ability to receive sound notifications during a conversation thread and I have found no other messaging app that offers that setting. It's very important to people like me who cannot constantly check their phones,5
com.textra,A Google user,have the pro version for a few years. My issue now is that lately when i send a picture it takes forever i will wait up to 4 minutes for it to send and still showing the pending dots. i will just delete the message and just send it thru the built in samsung app and it sends instantly. whats going on???,3
com.textra,Amy Kramer,I paid for the full version but I've since changed phones and it's not recognizing that I paid for it so I see ads again. The only option available to me is to pay for it again?! There are so many other texting apps out there that this is a deal breaker for me. Can the dev team help me out or will I need to find a different texting app?,2
com.textra,A Google user,Used this for 6+ years and I never stopped loving it. My two favorite features: you can customize the color scheme and you can schedule texts to send at a certain time in the future!,5

com.textra,A Google user,Textra is great. I love it. However sometimes it may glitch or something and when I open the keyboard to use an emoji or attach a pic...the button options are hidden. Like they are to far at the bottom of the screen and hidden behind my Home buttons,5

com.textra,Nestor Cervantes,"Textra has not made any changes to it's UI for YEARS. It's last major update was when Google came out with the first generation of material design. This look has been outdated for years now. It's really not that difficult to update the frontend of your app, you're just being lazy and frugal, despite that you charge money for your app. At this point, your built-in SMS app, or even Google's messaging app are more updated. Once Materia You comes out, your app will belong in a museum..",1

com.textra,Italo Gabriele Borrelli,It's the best text app out there for design but you're missing major features. I saw a thread where people have been asking for the ability to mark messages as read and unread that started in 2014! You implement that after all these years this rating is a five and I'll start using the app again. Until then bye. Also it says your beta program is full. It's probably worth updating your google play profile.,5

com.textra,Shaun Bowden,"A superb app. Does absolutely everything and looks great too. (Update after 2 years of use: Every aspect of this app works perfectly, so smooth to use. In fact, I wish I could use this interface on WhatsApp. It's leagues ahead. Bought a new phone and made damn sure I loaded this app and made it the default. Very highly recommended)",5

com.textra,A Google user,I used to love this app. Now it constantly freezes. I close it. Reopen. Takes forever and often hangs again. Uninstalled it and reinstalled it today. Same problem. Going to have to dump it and find something better. Sigh.,1
com.textra,A Google user,Edit: tried lots of uminstall/reinstalls. Finally reverted to v3.5 and worked. Then update straight to 4.7 works. Used for years then suddenly messages stopped sending mid Jan. Occasionally one will send but not consistantly. Other apps send fine.,5
com.textra,A Google user,I've been using Textra for about a year now and it's the best app ever I've been using it for my messaging app for since I downloaded it I recommend this app to anyone who would really use this app that has read a message that because you have a lot more options you can change the keyboard can change everything in the notification to can change the message bubbles message chats there's a hell of an emojis,5
com.textra,A Google user,Really like being able to schedule texts to be sent at a later date or time. I am using this feature to text reminders to myself and that works better than trying to remember to write it down.👍,5

com.textra,A Google user,"OUTDATED technology. Do not pay for Textra! I am a long-time Textra user. Until recently, I was a big fan. Textra did not reply to my support request about receiving SOME messages. 3 weeks later, I figured out my problem is that Textra doesn't support RCS messaging. Textra has been promising RCS since 2015. T-Mobile is ramping up RCS delivery. Hence, my ""missing message"" problem. In summary: (1) Outdated app. (2) Broken promises. (3) Non-responsive support. Find something else.",2
com.textra,A Google user,This app was working fine until the last few days. Texts are not sending to group chats and fail. Pictures are not sending through regular texting. Horrible experience and I sort of regret paying if this is how the app is going to be from now on...,1

com.textra,A Google user,"I like that you can have individual notification sounds for each your contacts.

com.textra,Daniel,"Have been Pro user for years now it's a great app that works perfectly and is highly customizable, but one thing I would like is to be able to customize the text color anywhere in the app",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This app allows me to send text messages to more than 10 contacts at a time! And it's super fast! But it does send you text messages that are ads but no biggie just ignore them, no problem..",5
com.textra,Essie Medina,"I can't believe I never knew about Textra a year ago. And I can't believe I hadn't written a review! Just try it out, you won't be disappointed! Update: Textra is still freaking amazing and I love all the customization freedom. You can customize chats, and notifications. Love it!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Sharing anything from outside the app is unbearable. Click share, select Textra, and you get a contact search, you cannot share or select a thread from your conversation list which boggles my mind. Unfortunately it ruins what could be a great app.",2
com.textra,A Google user,I've been using Textra for over two years now on a daily basis. I stare at screens all day long everyday and have grown to despise white backgrounds they burn my eyes they drive me crazy. Being able to change the background colors and go high contrast settings with Textra is a dream come true. I highly recommend Textra to anyone who is tired of the same old white screens and wants to give their eyes a break :-),5
com.textra,A Google user,"By far my favorite texting app. It's packed full of features, super customizable but still smooth as butter, and the devs are active and they just keep improving it. Honestly no complaints, this app is great.",5
com.textra,Marc Gruben,"When I used Textra, I absolutely loved it. It's by far the best SMS/MMS messaging app available. However, I've been using Google Messages for RCS and as of now, Google is still my default. When will Textra support RCS? I really want the availability to modify text size and change the text bubble colors to suit my theme",5
com.textra,A Google user,Recently switched to Textra. Really like the look and functionality. Have switched the design a few times and like them all. Using the version with ads with no problems.,5
com.textra,B,The copy OTP code button is missing now. Just started happening last week or so. Frustrating. Edit: worked with textra team and they found bug fix and are releasing a new version. Back to normal now.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the app. My only problem is I can't send videos.My old message app would resize them to fit into the size constraints. Unfortunately, Textra you doesn't do that- other then that I like it alot.",5
com.textra,Chris Bradley,"Love this app, unfortunately with my new phone Galaxy S20 there isn't LED notification on the phone. It would be handy to be able to still have something pop up on screen like other apps have adapted to. Not a deal breaker at all just a bummer.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"This app was great until the latest update. I can no longer send MMS over wifi, and the 'system and legacy settings' have disappeared. I emailed the developer and I am now waiting on a response.",2
com.textra,Vincent,"Great messaging app. I only wish that It was available on my desktop as well. For my phone, it's the best. With a desktop app, they would squash the competition entirely.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Very limited you can't add gui lines between each conversation on the app. It's a coloured back ground my stock sms has seperating lines which looks good. Also can't remove the blue circle pictures which I don't like either.,1
com.textra,A Google user,The free version has ads but I purchased the ad free full version and I love it. I've been using it for about a year now and the purchase was done time thing. Way better than Samsung's messaging app.,5
com.textra,Ella Burkett,I really like this app and have been using the paid version for a few years now for texting. I like that it's totally customisable and I have never had a problem or complaint. 100% recommend. Thanks Textra,5
com.textra,derek porlier,Works amazing! Way better then samsung's normal messaging app... idk why they don't fix it lol but amazing app would recommend!! The only downfall is sometimes it has switched my contacts names back to a default one but ita easy to change back so can't complain. Thanks!,5
com.textra,Peter Stanley,"tried for one minute. looking for an sms app that has fast indexing (textra is v. fast indeed) since my default sms app is dumb slow. rejecting textra because the default fonts are garbage and i can't change them. How am i supposed to live, it looks like a middle schooler designed this!",1
com.textra,Sherrie Ramirez,It never notifies me when I get a text message and I have a text tone set the volume up and everything is set exactly as it should be. I'm switching to chomp which my husband has which works perfectly!,1

com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using Textra for awhile now and it's, by far, the best text app I've tried. The premium version is worth the money. It does everything that the other text apps do but it does it cheaper, easier and better.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"if I could give negative stars I would. I JUST got my Galaxy 10+ today. Used Smart Switch and had been using my phone for hours. After realizing that I couldn't customize the stock TEXT app, I download Textra. Within MINUTES of this app, LITERALLY THOUSANDS of my text messages are GONE. DELETED the app and all gone. customer info. price quotes. messages with my kids. SO frustrated right now.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"Very customizable, easy to use. I wish you could remove people from group chats and search for texts directly in one message chain (not just the entire app). But I still love Textra and give it 5 stars!",5

I hope there's an update for it please.. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 07/05/2021 I tried your instructions but still doesn't work. Always asking if I Deny or Allow sending the messages. Please2x fix. Thanks",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Its excellent, but few suggestions... 1. In the msg view screen scrolling left or right should take us to other messages. 2. Calling facility can also be added to it. 3. Whatsapp can also be linked to it. Thanks",4
com.textra,A Google user,Customization. This is why I use Textra. I can have my SMS app act and feel exactly how I want it and need it to. Shoutout to the devs for the constant updates. You really have something good here. I paid for the Pro version within the first few days of using the app. I've been using it for over two years now.,5
com.textra,David Vasquez,"The texts updates from Textra saved me this morning. Google pushed an update that broke most of the apps on my phone. I learned from a Textra update text what was going on and was able to fix it. Textra as a messaging app has been my go to app for years now, this morning it seriously proved its value. Use this app for messages.",5
com.textra,Anton Sare,I've been using this app a long time and will continue to do so. It is quite simply the best. One feature I'd love is to be able to block by keyword/expression when disposable mobile numbers are being used for phishing texts.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"great app appart from one thing - can't turn off auto-retrieve on mms. deal breaker for me as leaves me open to uncontrolled costs on my tarrif (charged for inbound mms). has two other great features often missing from txt apps; will queue messages while offline and send when signal restored, and can shedule delivery for futre date/time. fix the mms and i'll be reinstalling",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Fully customizable, with some very neat features. Color schemes can be changed to match your theme. Lots more. I've been using it for 3 years on multiple devices and it's great.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Textra is one of the few apps I truly think enhances the mobile computing experience. i have no issues with it and it's feature-rich interface is pleasant to use.,5

com.textra,Michael Williams,Very impressive app. Highly customisable and very slick. Can be set to display a tall text entry window that contains a lot more than the four visible lines that most texting apps show. Just totally brilliant,5
com.textra,A Google user,I love this app the ability to control the vibration for individual contacts and also custom ringtones i just wish googls wouldn't have medeled in the colored notifications because tbose were amazing to be able to have a different color for different people this app doesnt lie it is truly blazing fast and an excellent text app,4
com.textra,Yelhsa Elocin Ertip,This app WAS great. I paid for the pro version but I want my money back. I can't send videos AT ALL from the app. So it's rendering useless to me at this point now. I WISH these problems arose before I paid the 5 bucks for the pro version.,1
com.textra,Cathy Olds,"Textra is the #1messaging app as far as Im concerned* love the options for color, themes,emojis,and all the rest that comes along with this app, NICE, FUN,just GOOD!!! All that haven't tried textra, I'm here to say your missing out on a very good thing, seriously!",5

com.textra,A Google user,"It's quite useful that you can set custom vibrations on this app, but one problem I've noticed is it doesn't notify you when someone texts you when you exit the app while still in their text window.",3
com.textra,Dave Thomas,I have recently needed to verify that messages are delivered to the recipient and now I find that sometimes the delivered time reported can be 3 or 4 hours faster than reality. I have a long commute and tell my wife that I am on my way home Last night I got home hours before my text! Quite strange! Delivery time noted is about when I sent it How can this be? I am now a truck driver and need to know if my texts are going through. Thanks fpr this ver useful app.6/13/21 upgrading for it was fixed😊,5

com.textra,Ewan Shawcroft,Great app. Switched to this when the standard android app stopped sending messages reliably. No problems to date and I really like the way Textra handles (intentional) delayed sending of texts.,5
com.textra,A Google user,love the customization this app enables (even individual contacts). Had an issue figuring out how to make my notifications appear the way I wanted them to with my new phone update and the support team constantly responded so quickly to help me figure it out!,5
com.textra,Candice Boone,Best texting app by far. *UPDATE* While I do love the app I took a star away because I cannot use it at a friend's house with poor signal and it won't work over wifi either. That's the only flaw I have found. Fix that and add comment reactions and it would be perfect!,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Very user-oriented.  They have thought this one through completely.  Very open to input and suggestions for improvement.  I used to be a big supporter of GO-SMS.  Not any more.  Textra is superior in every way.  Great job, developers.",5
com.textra,Rick Whitehorn,good text app. works well.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Best texting app, I love that you can delay text and get a chance to hit delete or proof read before you send the text. Also love you can pin text to the top. And change settings for every person",5

com.textra,A Google user,Thanks for your app. The standard Google / android message app would not compress images enough to use MMS on my network. Yours allows for customising this feature in its settings. Keep up the good work.,5
com.textra,A Google user,the app is the best on the market! has all the features i need except it doesnt work with my smartwatch! please make a smart watch app or so it can work with smart watches! other than that its the perfect messaging app,5

com.textra,A Google user,Ho hum app. No spell check on sending. MS Outlook Express had that 10 yrs ago. Duh? And u can't add or remove people from a texting thread w/o starting a new thread. Booooo! 👻 Wait - the developer is from Australia. No wonder.,3
com.textra,Muhammad Adil,An amazing messaging app. Have been using for many years still the best app i have ever used. its simple fast and customizable just the way i want. Please include the desktop web version as well that would be amazing,5

com.textra,Uzzy Booboo,"From a 4 to a 0 star in 20min. Used this app for 2+ years with little issue. Today is stopped working for no reason. Phone restarts, uninstall/reinstall and no change. Cannot access texts anymore. Very irritating.",1
com.textra,V R,I love the way you can customize this app. I have fun color coding each contacts text with either their favorite color or a color I associate with them. Ex: yellow - friend with the sunny personality. Pink - very feminine friend who loves pink. Blue for Doctors & medical appointment reminders. Green for $ or business related. Group texts become very easy to read also because everyone is color coded. Textra is also very good at keeping the app updated.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Mostly good experiences until the background data usage went out of control (free version) costing me $30 in overage fees before I could correct the issue. Went from 30 MB a month to over a GB in a week.,2

com.textra,Beth Lee,"Uzed to love it, now changed voice and paste. App keeps telling me to go download Google Voice which I already have. If I can't get Google Voice to work and cuts off after short. And will not let me finish even with pauses I hate it.",2
com.textra,Izzy,"This is an amazing app! Been looking for one that has both an option to change colors and theme yet still work great!

com.textra,Danielle Brazwell,"It's been great, but now I've lost the ability to change notification sounds within the app and it won't use the default notification sound settings from the phone.",2
com.textra,R H,Excellent texting app. You can change the color and each person can have their own icon. The ads weren't bad but I just bought the app and no more ads. 😀,5
com.textra,James,Textra is a great app. My favorite feature is the ability to slowly send your texts so you have time to rethink it or edit it. It's a great app to have. Thanks Textra.,5
com.textra,Panch B,"I have a suggestion. Can you have in your app a separate folder ""STRANGERS MESSAGES"" so that messages from people who aren't in CONTACTS LIST goes there automatically. This will make our life easier to delete those and spam messages. Also provide SELECT ALL option to delete messages in a bulk",4

com.textra,A Google user,"I really like this app due to the many customization options for each contact. I do wish we could change the background, but it's not a deal breaker. I like that I can choose how the ads pop up in my feed, although they aren't much of a problem.",5

com.textra,A Google user,Would be perfect if it can send multiple SMS msgs and not make it into a MMS. Since i handle a group of people its important to me to send blast msgs. I had to switch over to the default messaging app to be able to enjoy this. Otherwise i would choose textra,5
com.textra,Sharad Jagtap,I have installed it around 10 days before. Rearly I was getting the messages. Tody I have received only one message at 6.30 pm.

com.textra,Jake McCoy,Underwhelming very basic texting app that pesters you for reviews and alerts you about every single tiny change they make every several days. Really getting annoying. Hey Textra- Are you glad you insisted on my review? I have no intentions of paying to use this app. So I guess it's time to delete it.,1
com.textra,A Google user,"Love this app, the customization is what keeps me at bay and using this application on my Google Pixel 2 just feels natural. Those switching From IOS to Android, this is a definite pickup. Edit: Now coming to the era of RCS it's hard to use this app. If Google opens up the RCS API to the developer I would easily come back to Textra, as for now I will be using Google's messages as all my family and friends are now using RCS. Can't wait to see what's in store for this application.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I love Textra! A lot of customization options for all your contacts. I have recommended this to a few people and they have loved it too. Much better than the stock Android messaging app. And worth the $2.99 pro user price tag.,5

com.textra,Jeff MacDougall,I have tried pretty much all of the texting applications and Textra is the best fit for me. I am giving it 4/5 because I really want to see the abilty to customize the contact's text notification sound like I could in the Samsung message app. UPDATE 6/9/2021- I gave the 5th star because the awesome developer explained how to make the changes I was looking for!!

I hate to choose cuz then when someone replies from a group text that was already created and sent They send their reply to me individually and instead of the group message. But most of the time when I sent a group message I wanted to be sent out individually and for them to reply back to me individually. But I'd love to have the option to switch back and forth on certain group chat,4

com.textra,A Google user,"No problems. So far it's been dependable. My only complaint is the way it displays on my Android phone, which is as a narrow, long column. Needs larger bubbles.",4
com.textra,Tamia Travis,"Still love this app and all its features, just wish I could change the vibration pattern. It's a single long vibration that is similar to the basic call vibration pattern, and I would like to change it.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"For some reason my keyboard covers the emoji and other options when I tap the '+' icon. I can't attach media because of this. Otherwise, it's a great app.",4
com.textra,A Google user,This would be amazing except it has one missing feature that is key. There is no auto-reply. This is a must for me and in today's app world I find it crazy that Textra chose not to add this as a basic function.,3
com.textra,A Google user,I would give it a 5 star but every time I upgrade to a new phone this app is the only one that won't transfer as my purchased app. I changed the email but Textra has not changed it in their system. I've paid for it but it wants me to pay again because I have a new phone. Very annoying. Now what?,4
com.textra,Troy Masser,Nice interface. Only messaging app I found to send MMS messages through Xfinity mobile. Very similar to Google messaging app but with more customization. The only feature I wish it had was an archive option.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the feature that let's you schedule a text for the future. Also really like the ability to custmize conversations when it comes to colors, bubble types, and even notification symbols!",5
com.textra,Carol Wyatt,"Still not impressed with the stickers, and still nothing new with the emojis. 🤪 How about adding the ability to remove emojis 'previously' used? Edit: big fat emojis blown up are a turn-off for me and my friends. If they could be pressed on to blow up to an agreeable size would be better, and would please all. SMH!!",3

Dear Delicious: The app feature changed today, stopped working COMPLETELY. You say when there is an update. That doesn't really tell me much. I have absolutely no idea how often these things get updated. If you want to satisfied customer, you need to manage expectations. And don't make the customers have to get angry before you notify us.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"I really Textra, the only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the inability to add/remove people from group texts.

com.textra,R Paige,"Replaced Google Messenger App ~August 2920, my Google Messenger app started malfunctioning by not effectively delivering or receiving multi party MMS messages - which had a spillover effect of preventing delivery and receipt of SMS messages sent to individual addresses within those multi party MMS groups.

com.textra,A Google user,"Easy to use, plenty of features, customisations, and updates. I don't even remember the last time it crashed - so I bought the premium version.",5
com.textra,Steve Nelson,I liked this app on previous Android 7 phone. On my new Android 10 device some texts do not get received (optimization is off). Switched to default Messenger app (feels like a downgrade) but now messages are received. If you fix the Android 10 issues I'd rate the app 5-star.,3
com.textra,Kevin Smith,"Best messaging app for Android that I've found. Works well, integrates nicely with other processes, and very stylish. Only thing missing is a desktop/web client a la Pulse or the native Messages apps.",4

What I really like is you almost have all the settings to costumize its appearance. Good job! Can I suggest one thing? Can you improve the Circles where Letters are placed in it when the contact has no picture? Can you make it like similar to imessage? I think its more professional.

com.textra,Scott Johnson,I really like this messenger app. Seems to out perform the stock app that come on the Pixel 3.

com.textra,A Google user,"so far this is cool sms app hope it won't change please if you have updated version make sure its for the betterment not for making it worst version, i really like it now because it doesn't have annoying ads like in Go SMS, its really simple and easy to use keep it up Textra!",5
com.textra,richard bond,Love it - except that the Signature feature always inserts a space which results in incorrect formatting. Delicious support staff contacted me after this comment and tried to find a fix. We eventually worked it out together. Thanks guys👍.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Samsung phones don't let you set individual ring tones, so I started using Textra. I also like how each contact's text is a different color and how the font settings can be adjusted.",5

com.textra,Jon & Leaetta Wacker,I used to love this app. Five stars. But recently it seems to have been losing sent messages and delaying display of incoming messages. What's going on with this? Can u explain what could be causing this annoying behavior?,3
com.textra,A Google user,Best texting app. I installed this to replace my default messages app on my LG V30+ and could not be happier. This app offers so much customisation. It also has such a clean layout. Highly recommended to anyone hoping to improve their android experience.,5

Second, reason to this aweful app, I had my contacts lost and I had to go back and tell people so I can get their contacts again. I lost major amount of contacts. So your developers needs to go back and retrace their steps and fix and put a fix and update software. Will I use this nope. Will I use others yes. Google message llc its good and doesnt delete my contacts.",1
com.textra,A Google user,I have been using Textra for a couple of years now and find it to be one of the best apps of it's kind. It's easy to use and has a user friendly interface. Update: I have reconsidered my rating and concluded that the app should be given 5 stars. My normal instinct is to only give a maximum of 4 stars but upon reflection I this is one of the very few that deserves a top rating.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"I enjoy customizing text notifications so I know who's texting me without having to take my phone out of my pocket. Not sure if it's because of the recent update but now all text notification icons only show up white and I can't change it, what happened?",3

com.textra,A Google user,"- Does this app do just like what the default messaging app does? yes. - Does it bring on more amazing features and customization? yes, and thats why i paid for this app. Amazing app, but it's missing a feature that exist on the default app; the geasture swipe control that instantly does the command (call/message) instead of showing a button that i have to press to confirm my geasture. Why is this not without a confirm button?",4

com.textra,A Google user,I used this app before back in 2014 so by now I figured it had everything and would give it another chance. I've heard so many good things about it. But after playing with it for a bit I noticed there's no way to archive older or less used conversations. I don't want to delete the people I don't text as often but I don't want to see them cluttering up my thread. Is there any way you can add this feature? You'll get 5 stars from me if you do. Thank you!,3
com.textra,A Google user,Great app. I would like to suggest the following: 1. Addition of sending animation 2. Add an option to place the Time Stamp inside the message bubble. 3. Make bubble more square than rectangular. Thanks.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Waaay better than the standard messaging app. Crashes way less, can handle apps that send gifs right from the app, color customization of each convo is cool and so is ability to create your own vibrations.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"I was going crazy when Samsung change their programming and everybody's ring was the same. I hate that. So A friend told me about this, and I installed it and I love it it's got more bells and whistles than I could possibly ask for. I highly recommend it.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"The only thing that's stopping me from giving this app 5 stars is: 1. You can't schedule a date/time to send text messages. 2. You can't go to a text thread and single out the images. Otherwise, no issues.",4

com.textra,A Google user,Customizable and a beautiful interface. I won't use anything else. Please add ability to log in and save color and tone preferences.,5

com.textra,Leslie Griffin,I've tried a lot of different sms apps and Textra is by far my favorite. The only complaint I have is I wish I could change the background picture or color but other than that there's nothing to complain about. Great app that does just what it says,5
com.textra,mia youa,Excellent app hands down. Still deserves a 5 star rating. There is one fly in the ointment though. Textra seems to be using up a whopping 1 gigabyte of space now. That's right 1 gigabyte?😖 Is this normal for this kind of app to be taking up this much space on my phone??🤔 Thx.,5
com.textra,Roy Guerrero,Worked fine for a few months. Then one day it just crashed on opening regardless of what i did. Not that upset to see it gone as the only reason i downloaded it was to schedule texts which it can't do.,2
com.textra,A Google user,Seems to work fine. I really hate the advertisments that appear at the top of my previous texting. It's very distracting and makes me want to uninstall the app.,2
com.textra,ShiAnn Ford,I love this app. It's free. Limited ads. There are some but mine are always at the top and that's it. You can customize everything even the emojis. I've had it for about 2 years now. I haven't found an app that's like this one yet.,5

com.textra,A Google user,I love this messaging app. The only thing they don't have that the messaging app I used before this one was that I could lock a message that I wouldn't lose when I would delete the messages. Other than that I really like it!,4
com.textra,A Google user,Really like this app! I love to customize so this is great. Runs really well on my moto g6. I think it has lagged only a couple times but I believe it was my phone not the app. Definitely recommend this if you like customization. I don't think there's even ads! Haven't came across any anyways!,5

com.textra,Dana,Violates California law by requiring you to manually deselect individual advertisment tracking companies. This is malware. The response from Textra is disingenuous because it suggests that you must accept *tracked ads* to benefit from a free app. For most of human history advertisements have not been tracked. ***Textra requires you consent to be tracked by literally thousands of advertisement firms.*** There is no way for you to opt out of this other than by manually deselecting each company.,1

com.textra,A Google user,How can i change the wallpaper / background in open chat interface? And secondly bubble style just takes half screen and doesn't stretch on full screen for ease of reading SMS. please fix these two issues at priority.... Waiting...,4
com.textra,A Google user,I love this text app. I can assign custom ring tones to each contact. I can recieve/send pics and gifs with no prob. Only wish is that I could connect it to my PC and text from PC.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"My brother suggested this app to me so that when I write him long text messages, I can set it up so they come as one message not several in a rapid fire, out of sequence mess. It handles that perfectly. my brother not have peace when he watches the Dodger game he gets one text not seven in a row from a long msg. 👌👍✌️😁Had the app for a while now and I am adding a star",5
com.textra,Mike Neale,Have used Textra since I got my first Android phone. The built-in messaging app is very unsatisfactory. Textra is full-featured and customizable. It has always worked well for me.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Very easy to use, but has a lot of flexibility. You can personalize everything down to the emoji style and the app color. Favorite texting app I've used.",5
com.textra,michelle galvez,"I've downloaded 4 different messaging apps in search of the best and this is the best! Simple, easy to use, fun, no complications so far! 😊 Textra has all that I need.",5
com.textra,Kimberly Sumpter,I love how I am able to customize many things in the app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Notification problem persists in this app, Textra doesn't show any notification neither sound for incoming messages. This is when notification is set in Textra rather than in phone setting. @Textra: have a look into it, please!",3
com.textra,Ryan Lunsford,Its a phenomenal app and it is very quick with the speed at which it is awesome 👌 completely customizable and 10x better than the standard apps on smartphones. Will use it for as long as I have a android.,5
com.textra,Benjamin Swank,"I'm a pro user and it was well worth the money. Would get five stars if I could figure out how to send videos. I've tried making them lower quality to make the file smaller, making the video in the app, and sharing from other apps. No dice. Can't find it in settings. Help?",4
com.textra,A Google user,"It's a no frills app that just works. I can't point to a specific standout feature about Textra, but I much prefer it to stock Google messaging. It feels more intuitive.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Love the app but y'all need to add the ability to archive messages. I want to keep Textra as my main messaging app but I usually end up having to go back to Google stock messaging so I can archive my messages. Note--I originally meant to give 4 stars. Must have accidentally hit 3.,4
com.textra,Damon Magee,"There used to be an option to create a custom vibration pattern but now it's just one loud disruptive vibration. If you can't allow users to create a vibration pattern, at least give us more than one to choose from. Now everyone in the room knows when I get a text. Please add custom vibration patterns",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I've tried lots of sms apps and Textra is by far the best. I've never had any issues with it, it looks great, works great and packed with features. 10/10",5
com.textra,Renee Parker,I love everything about this except the fact that it keeps telling my SmartWatch to compose a message. It's rather annoying when my watch vibrates every 30 minutes when there's not a message coming in. I shouldn't be told to compose a message if I'm not in the messaging app,3
com.textra,gman sim,Good all around messaging app however sometimes message for no reason at all will not send. Even after cache is cleared and have good signal no matter how many attempts you make it will not send. Otherwise it would be 5 stars if not for this little Glitch......,4
com.textra,Zeshan Khan,"I have not used Textra extensively, but I like using text messages on my phone as well as on my desktop; write now android messages allows that ability and Textra does not; when Textra does that I will come back and try again, but right now I need both functionalities seamlessly.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Update: They sent me the old version in a support email :) Had this app rated 5 stars for like 5 years now. I can understand missing share gps I guess. But taking away my ability to change the color of the icon just seems unfair. Delicious may I have a previous version apk or something?,4
com.textra,A Google user,"Very customizable. I changed the look and behavior to fit my preference. It needs a better search feature, but otherwise is fantastic.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Been using Textra for over 3 yrs. It's way better than any built in text app on a phone. Hard to get it to recognise that you're a pro user after changing phones. But ads not too intrusive.,4
com.textra,A Google user,Textra has some nice features. But i never liked the spell checker. It never did a decent job. Then would insert the wrong words. I wouldn't realize it. Very frustrating. I could give it 5 stars but not yet.,2
com.textra,A Google user,I love textra!! I love how you can customize each contact so l always knows who texted before l even see what the message says. I have switched phones three times each time it's one of the first apps I always put on.,5
com.textra,Rick Barth,"Links are no longer ""clickable"". Also no longer has link preview. UPDATE: Fast response. They couldn't fix my issue BUT provided me with a way to revert back to an older revision. Works better now.",3
com.textra,Breeana Brandon,"This is hands down my favorite sms app, especially now that they added chat heads. I do kinda hope they someday add minimalistic themes other than just different colors for bubbles. Maybe gradient bubbles and/or a small selection of minimal backgrounds? Kind of like Facebook messenger has",5
com.textra,Joseph R. Sillup,"The new OTP copy feature is really useful for me, a great improvement! I used to say the OTP out loud to memorize it, now I silently enter it, much more efficient and secure. 👍👌😊",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I got this app so I could type with my big thumbs. However, it's so much more than that. The ease of adding emoji or stickers or random pics I have on my phone really helped me expand my range. I recommend Textra to all my friends.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Stopped sending MMS. Textra support was helpless at best. What fixed it for me was installing the older version and changing MMS settings to legacy. I also turned off the autoupdate for the app. Good luck.,3
com.textra,steve Smith,"Good for texting,looks pretty that's it. Anything else like sending pic etc for get it, very poor, have to revert to standard text app for that, which sends anything any size no problem at all,",3
com.textra,Lukas Stevens,Picked up this app coz Google default kept failing. This app has not missed a beat. Easy to use. Easy to adjust to. Has plenty of config options. Liked it so much I even went to the paid version. Thanks guys,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I honestly love the app!! My concern is why I don't receive notifications on my lock screen after 3 messages? that's super annoying, having to unlock my phone & see multiple modes messages. I liked it better when I could see everyone who text me",3
com.textra,Angelina Alvarez,"It's been great, but I have been having issues sending multimedia messages. I'll select a picture, but then the picture won't appear in the text box, and the button to send the message isn't highlighted, so I can't send the message. I usually have to close the app a couple of times for it to work, or send the picture via my gallery.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I love it because it works so well and has so many options that I didn't have before. It's almost too numerous to mention here. I like the fact that you can change how you view each persons text and you can have a signature on it and the list is as long as you want it. It's definitely much better than what I had and if any of you are reading this please check it out. It's excellent! Glad I found it.,5
com.textra,Kris Nicholas,That is one of my go-to app for messaging but recently after downloading a app tracking tracker. This app in a 5-hour period had 740 attempts from five different companies that were trying to track my information in this app. Now this really scares me and I'm really thinking about getting rid of this app.,2
com.textra,Mike,"App is fantastic. Only issue - 'share' dialogue doesn't suggest recent conversations. You have to type numbers manually, which is extremely silly and unpleasant.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I like it. Useful and I like the display. I most often use the gifs and emoji keyboard. 3 starts because it freezes and I have to close and reopen which is inconvenient.,3
com.textra,A Google user,Recent update removed infinitely recurring notifications for unread messages as well as the ability to change the time between reminders. don't understand why those feature where removed and find it very irritating.,3
com.textra,A Google user,i was getting fishing text messages being sent by an email address which i couldn't block using the default messager unless i had an account with my provider and did a 12 step process which didn't help. Textra solved it in less then 5 clicks and has a number of features that made the purchase a no brainer.,5
com.textra,A Google user,I started using textra cuz I wanted to have different alert sounds for different people. Samsung did an update and took that feature away. That was so stupid so I'm happy I found Textra. I recommend it. its user friendly and FREE. .,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I like the app a lot. Its customizable, and works well. No annoying adds everywhere, just the occasional add at the top of your screen. Would recommend ! :-)",4
com.textra,Nicole M.,This is a wonderful customizable app with one fatal flaw. It doesn't allow you to selectively block spam. I get a bombarded with Spam messages from the same area code and can't preemptively block them. Only thing I can do is block them one by one AFTER I receive the spam texts. People have been begging Textra for over 8 years for enhanced blocking and Textra ignores it. What good are all the customizable features when we have to wade through a million spam texts just to read our messages?!,3
com.textra,Rebecca Stump,Great app even though I ended up paying for it. I didn't mind not that much and I find it easy to use. Still using this app. Still like it over the app that came with my phone. On June 29th 2021 I had to email them because I got a new phone and was having issues with my app. In the same day I got a response! Amazing. I've been using this for a long while and just live the ease of it.,5
com.textra,A Google user,I've used this app on a couple different phones for a few years. It's great and works better than the default messaging app. I like the features and customization options.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Used to work. Messaging recently started delaying all received texts for hours and then eventually just stopped working altogether. I had even cleared cache, data and tried to uninstall and install...",2
com.textra,A Google user,Nice comfortable app😉 would get 5 stars except for the incredibly annoying and relentless reminder to change to default app even though it is and the pre-installed basic app is NOT the default app... Just annoying is all apart from that excellent would never go back to the stock app.....,4
com.textra,A Google user,its easy to look at and customize. one annoying thing is marking all messages as read does not give a promotes to confirm. i have done this on accident many times now. Also could a mark as unread option become available?,5
com.textra,A Google user,Uninstalled the default messenger app after finding Textra - it is a huge upgrade. Full customization options and features. Paid a couple of bucks for no ad version. Love it.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I have used Textra since I purchased my very first smartphone years back. I won't even consider using another messaging app...Textra is the first app I install on every new phone. It does everything I need it to, is quite customizable, and is updated regularly. If you hate default messaging apps I encourage you to purchase this one.",5
com.textra,AwkwardInYourPocket,Loved textra for a few years now. Suddenly it's using the most battery power out of anything else on my phone. Even my screen uses less battery than textra does. I lose 2% battery with every text.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"Comes usable and elegantly simple out of the box, but nice customization details like the ability to give your contacts different colored notification icons and speech bubbles and easy access to multimedia sharing have made Textra my text app of choice for years.",5
com.textra,Real Estate Agent,"I like that you can schedule and pin texts. However, when searching your contacts, many of them will be hidden. If they fix this issue with the name search, it would be 5 stars.",3
com.textra,A Google user,Considering switching apps as there is no search function within one conversation so you're forced to search all messages in all conversations one by one. This seems like a no brainer.,3
com.textra,A Google user,"Love the way you can customize each conversation. The emojis are great. Wish it were a little more compatible with Google. I like the different notification icons, but wish they could be in color like the app was designed.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Love this app. Started using when my note 8 stopped sending mms and there was no fix. Also besides all the functionality and in depth settings there's a hidden perk. You won't get Trump's alerts. Lol,5
com.textra,David Ruth,"Has all the features I want, and quite customizable, like sending delay, notification tweaks, export and import. I've used it exclusively for several years now.",5
com.textra,Bryan Grimm,"Everytime I get a text, it emails me the text. It's filling up my inbox. Can't change it in settings and can't unsubscribe by replying""stop"" or something similar in the email.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"I couldn't imagine using a different messaging app. It's super easy to navigate, fast and reliable, and super customizable. Definitely worth it!",5
com.textra,J. Bowser,"Had a problem with the app but the Dev(s) were quick to respond and offer a fix within a few hours. It's a great, simple SMS app with plenty of basic customizations so I'm glad I'm able to once again use it.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I am very pleased with this app. I am happy to once again have customized text notifications. I have had no problems or issues of any sort. Thanks, Textra!",5
com.textra,Jeff Fueston,Great app! I love the customization options. You can really make this a super personalized texting experience. Also there are frequent updates which continues to refine the app! Top notch,5
com.textra,A Google user,Downloaded this app because the default Google messages app on my moto c kept crashing and I have to say i am very impressed with Textra. Works really well and just the right amount of customisation options without being too overwhelming.,5
com.textra,Crystal Hamai,Great text app. I had an issue transferring my messages to my new phone and they were very responsive and helpful with the issue. I like the new icon choices for messages.,5
com.textra,Sue,Great App! I switched over from messages when I was unable to send pics. Textra is so easy to use. I would recommend all to switch over to them.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Excellent feature set. Stable app on my devices. I like and often use the scheduled/future/delayed sending feature. I really like the choose ad position feature too.,5
com.textra,Gordon Knight,"After years of being a loyal textra user switching now to google messages. Re gardles of being the best texting app, lack of spam control is really unacceptible. A simple keyword based block filter would go a long way. Just saying.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Since the last update Textra won't stay as my default texting app. Not any of my texts are actually going to Textra until I open it and then 20-30 second later some show up. But not all. I'm not getting notifications either.,2
com.textra,A Google user,"I liked Textra when I first installed it; however, it stopped receiving photos and delivering group texts and long texts. I'm back to using the generic Android text service.  At least that works.",1
com.textra,A Google user,This messaging app is the best I've ever used. Aside from it seamlessly taking the place of any stock messaging app it's very intuitive and easy to use. Well worth the small cost for no ads as well.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Great app. I'm having a bug where incoming messages aren't changing to a custom color and can't find a report option but otherwise this has been a perfect app.,5
com.textra,Pete Smith,"Hideously ugly and featureless. And they want me to pay to remove ads? I""ll just remove the program.",2
com.textra,A Google user,"great texting app, my default. adds are unobtrusive and can be eliminated for a low cost, permanently. incredible scope of customization, and absolutely no issues. love it",5
com.textra,A Google user,ive been using textra for almost a year now becuase of its ability to send groip texts based on my google contact groups. this function is easy and effective to use. the only negative is to remeber to start a new conversation after the group chat otherwise everyone get the reply,5
com.textra,A Google user,Textra picks up where the default messaging app falls short! I don't delete old message logs and so there is a large backlog and Textra handles it perfectly while the default messenger receives messages out of order because of it.,5
com.textra,Kristopher Lyseng,"A way to group chat, customize chat bubbles, and icons. I highly recommend this app, been using this app now for almost a year on two different phones. Transfered from one phone to the next flawlessly (I purchased the no ad version)",5
com.textra,A Google user,It does everything a texting app is supposed to do with a bonus. I specifically wanted to be able to schedule a text to be sent at a later time. This app does it perfectly.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Apps is good but notification sound doesn't work when you are outside the apps. Only vibration works. Once you are on replaying the message and suddenly message come in..... That the time notification sounds work. What kind or notif is that!!?,1
com.textra,A Google user,"Sept 2018: Great texting app...easy to customize, lots of options. Works very well! Update on Dec 30 2019: Thought about switching from Android to iPhone until I learned I'd no longer have Textra! Sorry, Apple!",5
com.textra,Cathy Newman,"Decent text app; not great spam filter. No way to preemptively block all numbers matching a prefix. Only way is to manually block individual numbers after receiving spam text. Critically, no way to block all texts from email addresses. Also, blocking only hides messages, doesn't delete them. And blocking spam texts doesn't correctly block sender; it adds to blocklist a string that includes sender + all recipients. No clue if sender is thus blocked. Can't block specific email addresses.",3
com.textra,Atif Shah,"Hi Dear Support Team, Its an awsome app but just need to add an option that if I take screen shot of the message it should be a complete message display with contact name, phone number, date, time and all text message by default under the name of the phone contact and not by pressing down the aero key for phone number please. Regards Atif Shah",3
com.textra,A Google user,"I finally decided to uninstall and never install this app again. Whenever I use this, I am not able to receive some of the messages sent to me. This happened not just once and I tried to figure out why. Definitely its not a signal issue. So better not use this.",2
com.textra,A Google user,Textra has been perfect! I love all the customizable colors and features. I initially installed it to force-convert long text messages into MMS instead of breaking up into separate SMS.,5
com.textra,A Google user,The best messaging app so far. I have tried several others including the built-in messaging app on my Samsung s10. Textra has a lot of customizable features and very easy to use! I love it!,5
com.textra,A Google user,I got this to replace the messages app that came stock with my phone because it wasn't showing me my notifications. This is the best texting app and I paid for the full version because it's worth it!!!,5
com.textra,A Google user,I am so sick of trying to open a text at the top and your stupid ads bump the text down so I click on your ads instead and open stuff on my data. Thanks but no thanks. This is literally why I am uninstalling your app right now. Peace,1
com.textra,A Google user,"I've been using textra for YEARS now, it's the only messaging app I can stand. It costs nothing so give it a chance, mess with all the customizations, it's absolutely worth your time.",5

com.textra,Mohit Kumar,Super clean UI. loved it. Only problem was that whenever any sms received on notification it shows unread but checking the app shows that its readed. means the message which are unreaded but this shows them readed.,4
com.textra,A Google user,I have had trouble and limitations with other SMS apps but Textra has been consistent and done what I want it to do. I am in several groups and Textra does not lag it keeps up. I am very pleased with it.,4
com.textra,Mallik Graphics (Digital Marketing),"So far the app is great I don't have any difficulties using it. My one worry is I can't backup my messages, I need to backup my messages in case my phone crashes I can retrieve them back again. Please consider this. Thank you. I'll give 5 stars once I dee that feature ☺",4
com.textra,A Google user,"Great, app. lots of personalisation options. I use it because my Stylo 4 fails to keep group texts in "" groups"" which is very annoying. Textra saved the day.",5

com.textra,Barbara Schweppe,I have used Textra for years and was very pleased. I am not happy with your app anymore. Something happened in December and I can no longer send pictures. I am able to send pictures in my other messenger app. Is there a bug in your latest update?,3
com.textra,A Google user,"i have been using textra for a while and i thought i could give support for the devs so i did upgrade to pro. Textra delivers a better experience for me compared to some vanilla text message apps, one advantage of this app for me is this app is able to play the notification sound even if the message thread is open, unlike on vanilla apps nowadays. I always rely on notification sounds while riding/driving/gaming and other activities so Thank you for this app.",5
com.textra,Erik Cano (MASTER CHIEFX377),"It is a super cool app,super customizable,no ads,great app for texting,great features like using the IOS emoji system,only thing I wish is they can add features as to liking a text or disliking, loving, smiling, crying and all that type of features like Instagram;other than all it's great.",5
com.textra,Jimmy Welch,Just downloaded textra to replace my message app on the my Lg phone ( android) Seems to work really good ... Will update this review after using Textra for a while. UPDATE: 2/2/21....I LOVE TEXTRA! FROM THEMEING TO EASE OF USE TO JUST PLAIN EVERYTHING ...THIS APP IS WONDERFUL... Finally a app that works great and looks great at the same time...this one is worth buying hands down... Forget about app hopping you've hit the jackpot with this one... You'll love it trust me!,4
com.textra,Jessica Ulrick,I like that you can customize everything. Its not great for sending videos and sometimes pictures don't go thru but other than that it's good.,4

Never had an issue before, until recently. The dev reply i got denied any responsibility and used my words ""never had an issue before"" as structure to their response. Funny thing is that I've never had any issue with my service until this app. Try listening to peoples issues and helping instead of passing the blame. Uninstalling.",1
com.textra,A Google user,"I've used this app for many years, and I absolutely love it. This is my second or third phone I'm using it on.

com.textra,A Google user,"Waiting on some minor bug fixes to be resolved with app creator, and know they will respond soon and help (or listen for the future).

Creators seem very transparent, ethical, and driven towards quality.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"MMS over Wifi quit working for me with the latest update, but that's due to Google's new policy (see Textra's related Support article), but they provided a fix where you can download an older version of Textra (3.5) and still have access to the previous fixes in Textra's settings.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"When in group chats and receiving multiple messages, the app will freeze and you wont be able to receive or send messages. Messages appear after 20 minutes. Very annoying",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Love Textra, bought the paid version a while back because the stock messaging app with android became slow when I had too many messages. I rarely delete any text. Textra was able to solve this problem and it remains great.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Since the most recent update it's almost impossible to send/receive pictures/gifs or have a group chat. I've used Textra for years but I'll have to uninstall if it doesn't get fixed.,1
com.textra,A Google user,"I like it, but it would be better if I could change the background of the text, the app sent texts through wifi faster, and LET ME PAY $5 FOR A ADD FREE VERIZON! And stop having the adds pop up outside the app.",3
com.textra,Graham Marett,"Used to enjoy this App, but becoming too buggy and unreliable. GF still not received text sent yesterday lunchtime, but others since, and she uses Textra also. Not been seeing 'Delivered' status on messages either for a while, so no confidence they've even been received. Please fix this! Both use Huawei Mate phones on Vodafone.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"Works great and is customizable. Only downside is free version has ads, but i really enjoy it. Being able to use the same emoji set as my bf really cuts down miscommunications :)",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Cant text more than 10 ppl at a time on ATT, so downloaded this app....love all of the customization options available. Cool app except sometimes the notification sound doesnt work, sometimes it does.",4
com.textra,GhostRyderID,"Boo, Textra still requires Google Voice for voice texting. My entire reason for trying it was trying to find an app with voice texting that didn't use Google voice. I don't need the overlord listening in on my every word, so I have Google voice disabled. The hunt continues.",3
com.textra,A Google user,"The default Samsung app was giving me all sorts of issues with attachments and gifs ect...my buddy recommended Textra and I haven't gone back. Not much to say, it just works as a messaging app should.",5
com.textra,A Google user,The scheduling function is not working properly or at least the Sent time is shown incorrectly. Maybe becouse the app needs to be connected to wireless service to work or maybe it is simply broken.,2
com.textra,A Google user,This is by far the best SMS/MMS app i have used. i have tried numerous ones and keep coming back. it is feature rich and updated frequently. Well worth the few dollars to upgrade to the Pro version.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I've just paid for the pro version, that's how much I love this app. My kids are jealous of the colours of my texts and now they can be jealous of the ad free version too! And thanks for the reply for help regarding bulk messages.",5
com.textra,Jon Beer,Much better than the stock app on Pixel. Most important to me is customizable notification chime repetition and font size choices. Ads are hardly noticeable--just a small banner at top.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Switched from Apple after 8 years. This has been the best texting app to replicate what I liked about the iPhone. I wish more apps had the customization options this one does.,5
com.textra,Jack Swann,I enjoy texting again without feeling like I'm settling. This app does everything right or let's me customize the way I like. I have thoroughly tried all the top apps and this one is head and shoulders above the rest.,5
com.textra,Michael Holbrook,"*update Have been in 2 week email conversation with Jason and then Mandy. After asking me to provide screenshots and emails and porrfs for weeks, Mandy convinces me to purchase the app again, claiming she'll refund the 1st purchase afterwards. Lie, no refund Hi. I've been using this app literally for like 10nyrs, have had the pro version for most of it.. for some reason when I got my new phone. The pro version isn't transferring over and now I don't know how to get it back without paying again.",1
com.textra,Stephanie Valentina Palazzo,The new update won't allow for customized vibrate patterns!! I don't have android 11. & the vibration patterns that are stored for previous contacts work and I can't change the vibrations.,1
com.textra,J. L. Wiggins,The app works better for me than the default Samsung messaging app. I like the many options to customize alerts etc. per user & really like the delay-send option. Works well with Samsung phone & watch,5
com.textra,greg smith,"Was using textra for years, but this addition of adding a small menu before opening links has forced me to find something new, as a pro user they should make a change like that optional, for my use case it's an extreme annoyance.",2
com.textra,Shivam,"Not receiving any sms not only this app, all third party apps aren't receiving. Only stock app is working in this context. App is whitelist in every context i.e. default app, battery optimization exclusion, unrestricted data usage at background, have all permissions allowed. Tried reinstalling also.",1
com.textra,A Google user,Every time I receive a video it looks terrible the quality is worse than that of a 00s flip phone I dont understand why. I have set the carrier data limit to none. Is this really how they're supposed to look?,2
com.textra,Caitlin,"Been using Textra as my default messaging app for years and will continually download it as I get new phones. Sometimes I wish there were more colour options for customization, but the app itself works flawlessly!",5
com.textra,A Google user,Such a great texting app! The only thing i would add is a feature that let you know when a text you sent was opened and read. But other than that its great!,5
com.textra,A Google user,its solid just wish it had a number of texts counter on the main app. In example if you are in a meeting and you are getting texts it would be good to see the textra icon with a number above of icon to indicate the number of texts received.,4
com.textra,Erastus Kilonzo Mutua,"It's a wonderful Android SMS app. Unlike Google SMS which doesn't allow customization of fonts, Textra does. It allows customization of fonts as you want.",4
com.textra,Jared,"Very easy to use, small features are nice. You can customize bubble color for every person, can schedule texts for certain times, it's pretty great",5
com.textra,A Google user,I like the cuatomization of the app. But it closes the app every single time i send a text. It tends to get very annoying everytime I try to have conversations with people,2
com.textra,A Google user,After having issues with other SMS app started using Textra and very happy. One of the feature I like is saving messages to send later which acts like reminders. Been using from past 18months with no issues.,5
com.textra,Phil Sweet,"I like it the app alot, lots if customization and options. My only gripe would be watch compatibility, would be nice to have a plugin option for Samsung watches if it's even possible.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"The application is pretty good. Everything is working well. The only issue with this app I'm facing is, sometimes it does not notify for new messages which is much disturbing for me. Please get this problem solved. Thanks",4
com.textra,A Google user,EDIT: (The support team was great with helping me fix this.) The app is great but on the S8 active the keyboard covers the attachment pane so I can not use it anymore :( I did really like it when it worked.,5
com.textra,A Google user,My icon and notifications are not working at all. I have went through all settings to make sure app notifications are on. It just stopped working one day.,1
com.textra,A Google user,"This app is excellent for my Galaxy Note 4 since it has the old OS which is no longer upgradable. This is a perfect upgrade for your old Android. Send videos, emojis, :-), contacts and many more perfectly from your phone",5

com.textra,RAYMOND FONTECHA,"I tried a bunch of text apps in the past, but none that had al features I was looking for... Really satisfied with this text app. Especially the scheduling feature.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Easy to customize and I like that you can change bubble color for different people. Would be nice to have ability to use custom notification sounds instead of the restricted list offered by the Galaxy 9+,4
com.textra,Bob p,"Great app. I had tried several but every one had one little stupid thing. Textra did too, but with one email to support, they showed me how top fix it. Lots of options and it works!",5
com.textra,stanley johnson,"Not bad, trying to avoid using a bunch of google apps and textra has been great. Small issue when in group chats but i assume that its a cross compatibility issue with apple. So far so so good all in all. Good job guys keep it up!",4

com.textra,E B,I like that I can customize a lot of things. How about adding a little picture of the person on the left I am texting to. How about adding a date n timestamp under each bubble.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"good app. but when you try to re enter the app, it doesnt take you to the conversation where you left off. it takes you back to the list of all your conversations which is annoying.",3
com.textra,Fiona B,They have all gone through. It lets me write long texts. I like that I can customize the colors for each person I send texts to. I've been using this app for almost 2 years.,5
com.textra,Chelsea Fritchey,"LOVE THIS APP 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 the only thing that could be added that would make it absolute perfection is a snooze feature which, when a message comes in you can snooze it to be notified again later so you don't forget to reply.",5

com.textra,A Google user,"Love the app. I want the chance to schedule text or sms messages, i miss that from the default app. And the chance to lock a message wouod be awesome too. Any chances any of this gets added to textra? They fixed this and now I'm loving it even more..",4

com.textra,Sef Buford,I've been using Textra as my primary messaging app for a few years now since a friend recommended it. Through 5 or 6 phone changes and I would never go back to the native text app offered. It is great & I recommend it 100%,5

Other apps like Facebook, Gmail, etc shows the badge icon. I have been uninstalling, installing and change Textra settings but still no badge icon.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Honestly it's the best app for sms. Definitely most customizable. Only complaint i have(and the reason im not using it anymore) is I can't text from my pc. It would be amazing if devs worked something out like Google messages have web version of the app. Edit: thx for the response but i would want to use this app not MighyText or whatever,5
com.textra,Ozzie Gonzalez,Works well so far. I am doing a scheduled text campaign with a 10 second personal video attached. Let's see how the results come in. I will update this review in 6 months. If successful I will add 5 stars. I wonder what the paid version offers. I will look into it.,4

com.textra,A Google user,Works really well. Hardly any ads with the free version. I installed it mainly because it offers distinct sound notifications which I can customize for different persons.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Textra is always the first app I download on a new phone. Limitless customization options that ensure you never accidentally text the wrong person! And beautiful UI with vivid colors. Thank you Textra!,5
com.textra,A Google user,Love it. It's everything i want for a messaging app. It's simple and u can personalize it. I just wish that the ads will disappear even without purchaseing the pro version,5
com.textra,A Google user,Best texting app period. The ad at the top stops being annoying and you get used to it. It doesn't show in your texts just at the top of your list of texts,5
com.textra,A Google user,"Simple app, easy to use. I paid to get rid of ads, worthwhile decision. The color customization is all I really care for and they do it well. Good app, well made.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Great except... Why do I get an audible text notification even if my phone is on vibrate? This seems to happen when I have the text window open... Very frustrating when I'm texting near our sleeping baby. Using a OnePlus 7 Pro.,3
com.textra,Travis Hendricks,"In 2022, this app still doesn't support RCS. That needs to change for this app to stay relevant. Otherwise, solid customization and many features most people won't need, but it's easy enough to use anyway.",5

Once fixed, I'd gladly rate 5 stars.",3
com.textra,A Google user,I really like this app. I think the only thing that would make it better would be to be able to control the background color. Not just light or dark but actual color and shade of color like the icons.,4

com.textra,G M A,I love the app buty voice to text has disappeared and I cannot get it back. The voice to text feature works in every other app. Please help! Thank you.,1
com.textra,Brody Behm,"I've been using Textra for a few years and don't plan on using any other messaging app. I enjoy all the features and customizations available, and I've never had an issue with the app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,Textra data usage has increased more than 8x since upgrading. received a notification that I've used half of my data (never happens) and Textra is the culprit. What are you doing support?!?!,1
com.textra,Hannah Sapp,Easily the BEST text messaging app on the market. I've used it for years now. Worth paying for the premium to get a seamless and customizable experience.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I love the app, but my texts always just say sent not delivered. Picture messages show sent when sent and delivered when delivered. Aside from that, I have no problems with the app.",4
com.textra,Mr Lodgeitude,"Constant crashes all of a sudden. This app has been pretty reliable for a long time, but these constant crashes are frustrating.",3
com.textra,Dwayne Hillery,"I Love fluidity of this app, I like all the different options they offer, as in different operating systems for emojis. You can also use different colors and text bubble sizes when Textin' + you can use your personal signature for your texts too !!!!!!",5
com.textra,Sharee Guyton,I was really liking the app however all of a sudden I can't attach photos by pressing the plus sign. I have to go to the photo itself then click share. I'm not liking this change.,4
com.textra,Megan Nicotra,"None of the nonsense I've had with other texting apps, it just does exactly what I want it to do. Love it! Used to love it. Now I am bombarded by immoral advertising for disgusting services. Deleting today.",1
com.textra,Myr Tariniel,"Suggestion: if I tap to open the keyboard, it's a little annoying for the message to scroll down by the length of the keyboard. Premium version is well worth it. Keep up the good work 🖤",5
com.textra,Quinten Salazar,Great app but for the last few days all my messages show they couldn't be sent. But I just try to resend them and they go through no problem. Odd maybe a bug to look into?,5
com.textra,A Google user,I like this app. Mostly as I kept getting charges for sending a text with too many letters. This app splits them so it's a saving. It could be my phone but wish I had a message to say I have a missed text,5
com.textra,Nick Clifford,Has been crashing frequently after latest bug fixes but like the blocklist feature,3
com.textra,Steve Martin,"Very customizable. Easy to use. Tons of options. Just an all around great app, so much better than the default SMS/MMS app. Highly recommend to everyone.",5
com.textra,Tam Stull,Just what you need. A simple messaging app that does what it is supposed to do. I do wish I could find a messaging app that completely blocks certain numbers. I dont want to be able to view blocked messages.,5
com.textra,Dmitry Tyler,"Like the app, but can't share PDFs. It doesn't support pdf sharing.",4
com.textra,Walter Kawecki,"Great app. Would love a toggle for group vs bulk messaging at the message level, rather than having to go into settings, but the pinnable contacts has made this my go to messaging for years now.",4
com.textra,A Google user,"easy to use, I like the customization of conversations. After updating my S7, I couldn't customize ringtones or text message tones. That's why I installed Textra",5
com.textra,A Google user,Very customizable but only issue I have is that a lot of emojis showing as X's with a male or female symbol...don't know what they are until I send to a friend and ask what the heck they are. Very annoying,3
com.textra,A Google user,Textra has worked really well for me so far--I've used it for a couple of years.  I ran into problems with a new wearable device recently and Textra support helped me figure it out right away.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Love the app. Paid for the full version pretty quick. I'd like to see some sort of message filter like how messenger puts commercial messages in a different folder.,5
com.textra,Glenna Winters,"Update:..... Can no longer use. Texts will not send. The Google ""fix"" does not work. I've used Textra for a few YEARS now. It is the best app for texting. I love that I can personalize for people I text often.",1
com.textra,Joel Hacker,Way better than default sms. Ability to pin specific conversations to the top of the list is my favourite feature. Allows me to keep important chats and group chats prioritized without cluttering up my home screen with direct message widgets,5
com.textra,A Google user,Great replacement for crappy messaging apps! Love the customization options and the interface in general is very intuitive. Does everything I want it to do.,5
com.textra,Luis Soto,I love the customizability of the app and I've tried it throughout the years but still not being able to use Wifi to send MMS is still a no go for me. I have no signal in my building and Wifi is my only texting option.,1
com.textra,Andrea Oakes,Your new blocklist update you have to memorize the phone number in order to block than instead of allowing users to choose from their contacts. Not efficient at all and quite honestly a terrible change.,1
com.textra,A Google user,"Best Message App. Fantastic app! I've installed it for someone with sight problems and customisation of the text size, style, notifications, sounds, even the icon colour make it a 5 star app.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"I must say that I've tested a few apps over the yrs & I've have even tried this app long ago & was unsatisfied. But, I can now say the developers of this app have out done themselves. It's user frndly & stable w/perks. It now has everything I need & want in a txt/mms app. It works just fine w/my Gear Frontier watch as well. That a plus+!!",5
com.textra,Lisa Jessop,"I really like this app. Fun colors, and customizable. Only frustration say this time, I cannot get the web links to work. And the link saying to go back to old doesn't work.",4
com.textra,A Google user,I enjoy this app. But I wish it has features to let you know when the messages has been read or at least received. My only real con about this app is you can't change the ethnicity of the emoji families. Other than that I really appreciate this app. It even allowed me to make myself as an emoji which is cool. But I would love my family too. Lol,4
com.textra,Allan Grossman,After using Handcent for years I switched to Textra 3 years ago and never looked back. hands down the best Messaging app for Android. And their support is outstanding. Highly recommended.,5
com.textra,Mario Minto,Still really slow when sending MMS. Sometimes it's minutes later that I realize that the message hasn't been send. Other times I get a message saying there's an issue with sending MMS.,2
com.textra,Ryan Green,This is the best SMS app. I've been using it for many years.,5
com.textra,Rose,"I really love this app! the custimaztion options are expansive and awesome, and even when I started to have ads, they aren't intrusive at all. Definitely recommend.",5
com.textra,A Google user,I always seem to come back to Textra. It just always works and I can make it look exactly how I want it to. The only thing that could make it better is if you could pin a single text instead of a whole conversation.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Like the app except you can't archive conversations so that there is less clutter. Would like to keep this app but can't without archiving. Four stars for now. Hopefully you'll add archiving. I trust the developers will add this in the near future.,4
com.textra,A Google user,"One incredible feature of Textra that always keeps me coming back is the ability to schedule texts. Most phone's stock texting apps don't support it, including the Pixel.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Solid replacement for the default texting app with good customization options. The ads in the free version aren't intrusive, which was a pleasant surprise.",5
com.textra,Neely O'Keefe,"I love being able to customize colors, icons and sounds for individual people! Been using the app for several years now and never had any issues!",5
com.textra,Doug Powell,"Textra is very nice, I absolutely LOVE it! It is intuitive and very user friendly. There is an abundance of adjustments and app applications for personalizations. A+ A+ A+ A+ thank you Textra!!!!!",5
com.textra,Eena Veronica,Ive been searching a lot of different text application and gladly i found this one and i like it so much. It can easily use this texting apps and a lot of customize you can do base on the style you want.. So i rate 5 stars .. (i hope this app can be update its message tone) .. Thank you!,5
com.textra,A Google user,Amazing app. Been using it for ages now and works perfectly fine. Love it!! Keep going and hopefully you can make new updates to it in the future. Would recommend to so many people that have problems with their normal messaging app.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Only good experiences with this text app. And if you don't pay for the full version. The ads are minor in that they only show in a small box at the top of the screen when you see all your messages. No big deal,5
com.textra,A Google user,Great texting app I've been using for years across multiple phones. Recently had an issue with a bug in the options and the support devs sent me a software fix literally within hours.,5
com.textra,A Google user,Developer responded in just a few minutes to let me know there is a setting you can change to move ads around. Not what I expected at all. I have no complaints now. Great app.,5
com.textra,Wally,Does everything I need it to do. Went pro! Love the blocking group text feature. Don't like being able to delete all messages without more warning. Trying too delete multiple messages ended with all my messages being deleted! Major issue.,5
com.textra,Mladen Stanojevic,"MMS - video quality sucks!!! App is great, I really love it, just when receiving video, quality is probably shrunken down to bytes. How to bypass this! And no, carrier has no limit does not do a thing!!! Thank you!!!!",5
com.textra,A Google user,"Aesthetically pleasing, the emoji packs are nice, and the ability to color code contacts is a godsend. About the only thing it's missing is a desktop client.",5
com.textra,A Google user,"For some reason the Google SMS app on my new Motorola doesn't work properly. I cannot get it to announce incoming texts. So, after many hours wasted I've downloaded this app and to be honest it's quite good 👍",4
com.textra,A Google user,"So far, I really enjoy using Textra, and it's leaps and bounds an improvement over the default Android messaging app. As soon as they implement a way to archive messages without deleting them, I'll bump my review up to five stars. :D",4
com.textra,A Google user,"good, lot's of options. personalized. customize your settings. small App with lots of features. old news, i did a factory reset and Textra won't give me my paid pro app.twice! ill get over the $3.99. i know delicious will make it right.",4
com.textra,A Google user,Been using this for a over a year. Has great functionality over the stock messaging apps I've used. Love the ability to schedule a message to be sent later.,5
com.textra,Adeniyi Adeboye,"Excellent app. Prompt delivery & beautiful customization. I hardly review app but this is awesome 👍🏼. Though, it would be more better if there is an option for seeing unread msg in BOLD or in the current accent dot.",4
com.textra,Mark Tait,Literally saved my android experience. Google messages is slow and glitchy especially when having multiple conversation. I can sacrifice the 3 contacts I have that use RCS for a fluid messaging experience that Textra offers.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"So many lovely customization options, clean interface, simple to use and understand. When I did have an issue with my contacts, the support team was helpful and quick to respond. What more could you ask for?",5
com.textra,Kevin McElligott,"I've been using this for a few years now. It's absolutely fantastic! The Settings screens are deep and wide, meaning that you can customize it to your preferences. I'm done looking... This is the one for me.",5
com.textra,Drew Mills,"I got tired of the android 'messages' app not being customizable, and needless to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much you can customize textra! I really love the appearance and functionality of this app!",5
com.textra,A Google user,I purchased this app so I didn't have to see annoying ads. Within a week it didn't work anymore. Kept have errors and people's wouldn't get my texts. Not recommended!,1
com.textra,A Google user,"Great app, the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the app doesn't work with my Samsung watch and because you can't just copy part of a text you have to copy the whole text. Honestly other than that it's a super solid app.",4
com.textra,A Google user,so gave this a try and it was a serious mistake. sometime after installing textra it stopped sending messages. There was no error message or indication that they werent being sent. Not cool!,1

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Julie Kim,"I love the fact that this message app is much more flexible. For example, without having to have certain phones, emojis are available to use for all. Another example is that I can delete messages if I didn't express properly or found typos. I just wish an editing feature was available instead of having to delete the entire message for whatever reason. Overall, this is my preferred method of communication next to Telegram app where all things I appreciate are available.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shonda Campbell,"The main reason I downloaded this is to have more security, privacy, & break away from everything Meta! I like the simplicity of the app. I do wish that we had more color options for the chat bubbles. It would be nice to have a darker chat bubble option, especially in the spectrum. For someone who has a light sensitivity, darkness is my friend. So maybe perhaps on the next update you guys could give us a more robust color option. Other than that it's wonderful! The ability to edit would be nice!",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Heather Stevens,Signal's decision to discontinue SMS support is upsetting. I will not juggle multiple messaging apps. I refuse. I cannot convince my entire contact list to change to signal. I LOVE this app as is and cannot justify multiple messaging apps. I dont even use multiple social media platforms. I'm genuinely sad this is happening. I love as much privacy as I can get but unfortunately convenience and ease of use is extremely important. Signal met all of the criteria until now. Disappointed.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Peter Stead,"I have really liked signal so far. I switch from WhatsApp because of their changing privacy conditions. Signal is much more private. The quality of the app isn't much different from WhatsApp. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I have downloaded pictures from signal to my phone a few times and the only way to do it is 1 at time. It's really frustrating that you can't just select multiple pictures to download. Also, video quality is poor when you video call someone.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Paul H.,"One of the best video messaging apps I have seen, and I have tested a lot of them - both as a professional Product / Project Manager and for my own personal 'gaming' interests. This is very nearly the perfect solution for every use case, and that is saying a lot. Increadibly flexible set of features and controls. I don't give many 5 star ratings, because there is always room for improvement- but this one is very near perfect.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kirk Degler,"I like that I can send end-to-end encrypted messages, but I don't appreciate the somewhat recent decision regarding SMS . I understand the logic, but I disagree. I would rather Signal have made UI changes to *really* flag/highlight conversations that are not encrypted. It's hard enough to sell X to people when they are used to Y. I also am not a fan of the decision to add stories to the application. Let's not make the app bloated and potentially increase the attack surface.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andrew Mann,"Biggest feature is encryption. But the rest of the app works better than all other messaging apps. Edit: Starting nov. 22, 2022, signal keeps crashing and stopped working. I restored from backup twice. First time it started working then crashed again after 2 days. Second time, it crashed as soon as i restored. Both times, it crashed while making a new backup. I'm still giving 5 stars, but just letting everyone know, if your backup is more than 6GB, this might happen.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jonathan Morford,"Bummed about the removal of SMS and addition of stories. To me, Signal is a communication app, not a social network. I do not intend to use stories and have turned them off. Conversely, I have contacts leaving Signal because they depended on the SMS integration to not have to figure out which app to message a contact with. The issues mentioned on the blog could have been resolved with better UI. As a techie, I do understand the challenges, but feel this change will ultimately hurt Signal.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Loki Hondorf,"Amazing app, has allowed me to bring several friends that aren't as concerned with privacy into a secure environment. However with the recent decision to drop sms, most of those friends will certainly be dropping the app and I may as well. The usp of signal used to be a single messaging app where e2e encryption is avalible cross platform. The app serves little to no purpose if I only have 1 or 2 contacts on it as there are plenty of channels where this protected communication can happen. Sorry",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jonathan Love,Please add scheduled messages and editing messages. Format of wallpaper needs some adjustments after you've selected a picture is zooms in and looks of bad quality. Great app and better alternative to WhatsApp and Google Chat. So far the features are pretty standard. You can send decent quality video/photos. No 4k HDR like iPhone but it's a step in the right direction. Please donate!!! No this isn't sponsored ü§òüèæ,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Zachary Hendershot,"The decision to drop SMS support is absolutely unacceptable, especially given the decision to add stories. You've replaced a feature that I used every day with one that I will never use. I don't buy for a second that it was to focus on encrypted messaging, you added useless garbage. Yes, I realize that my SMS conversations were not encrypted, but it was beyond convenient to have everything in one application. Formerly five stars, it was a good run.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aaron Firouz,"Signal is pretty great both as a standard messaging/chat app and as a secure communications tool. I've had mixed success trying to get folks off iMessage or SMS, but those that have switched have been happy with the experience. That said, recent decisions like adding payments and ""Stories"" are a little concerning. I'm sure both can be done while respecting privacy and they are intended to increase appeal, but they feel like bloat and a bad direction for the app.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Devon Parker,"This messenger is decent. However you cannot edit messages, and they just took away the ability to delete an image a while after it's been sent. Now in order for messages to disappear you have to set up an automatic timer and you cannot delete images you've sent manually after a few hours. This decision doesn't make any sense. Normally I'd probably give the app a solid 4 stars, but until this ability that already existed is restored I can't recommend it.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Paul Metzgar,"This app was a great all in 1 app. I could text, video chat, and send photos to family and friends from around the world whether they had Signal or not. Sadly, the company has foolishly decided to remove its unencrypted messaging service. I cannot have an app on my phone that will not accept unencrypted messages. Google, Microsoft, and other companies that send verification messages will not get through under the new update. I will be replacing this app as soon as I find an adequate replacement",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Abhijeet Malik,"Privacy first class. Security first class. Backup / restore ability third class. Especially for cases when you need to switch phones or just loose / damage your phone, you don't have any solution. I understand the background of privacy and security to ensure the data is not hacked / exploited. But there should be some ability to configure profile, so if you chose a less secure profile, you are able to backup messages etc. On cloud and restore it late. Different users have different requirements.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Deatria Cameron,"I like Signal. It's intuitive to use. I'd give it five stars if it had better integration of notes to self, one tap button record (The slide feature is awkward and not precise), and if the developers shifted phone number sign in to regular account sign in, to easily log into your personal account on any device including any phone numbers.... It's just super silly to have issues accessing one's account on another phone. They do need to make proper improvements, and this app could get five stars.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aurora M,Having only one app to receive all text messages was golden. Signal should recognize when the app is not installed and allow users to deactivate and unlink with the phone. Previous Signal users that no longer have the app do not receive any text messages. It's very frustrating. This new change to not receive sms texts only force me to use a second app. Ads are a nuisance.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Freya Black,"It was nice to use to start off with, but as time goes on, it's getting worse. Messages won't send at random. Can't message people that don't use signal, especially if it is set as my default texting app. I like some of the features, but it's a messaging app. If it won't send simple texts, there is no point in using it. Edit: still doing it. I'm so done with this app",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,G A,"Fantastic tool, sort of... My concern was when I moved from one phone to another,but that proves to be a moot point. The tool to transfer works great! No msgs lost, pictures were even moved. Love it. Great job! However, not being able to send/recieve from other SMS app, usefulness significantly drops. I have to have another app to send messages to people who don't use Signal. I understand your decision, but I regret you made that choice.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rudy Messex,"As signal operates today, it is useful and easy. After the sms capability goes away I have no intention of trying to keep track of who has signal and who doesn't. Today, I have a single platform that encrypts when it can but still functions when it can't. I've donated to the project because it was great. But we all have to deal with contacts that will never switch to Signal and I'm too busy to check if someone is on signal when I have to send a message. Sorry to see this change.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Morgan Montgomery,"This was my default messaging app for the last couple years, and it worked great! However with Signal ending SMS service it just doesn't make sense to use it anymore. I just don't have enough Signal-using contacts to make multiple messaging apps worth it. I have many contacts who would not be willing to move (and it's a harder sell now than it was before), and I won't be able to receive automated messages anymore either. I'd gladly come back if SMS service was restored but for now it's goodbye.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andrea Waagen,"I thought I had finally found the perfect app! And for over 3 years it was amazing. Now I am forced to go find a new SMS app to be able to message anyone WITHOUT Signal. I can't get notifications from UPS/FedEx etc. I can't text my 80yo mother. I will probably just delete the whole app. I loved it!! But I hate the inconvenience of having multiple apps to do 1 simple thing. Shame on you, Signal!!",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Patrick Gray,"It's great software, but the removal (WHY?) of SMS text message support is a huge step backward for Signal. Now, instead of managing all my messages in one convenient location, I have to juggle two apps - one for the 10% of my contacts who value privacy, and another for the remaining 90% of the world who either don't care, or who use something other than Signal. What a bone-headed move. Cutting off SMS only means that Signal users will fall back to whatever app supports the most contacts.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Michael Forseth,Great app until they took away my favorite feature. They announced they are removing SMS. I really liked having a secure messaging system and SMS available within a single app. I was able to keep all my conversations in one place. It was great when I had a friend or family who refused to get signal. I don't really plan on using signal anymore without this feature.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tiny Tiger,"I have loved this app for years. BUT the fact that they are discontinuing SMS services instead of putting it in a separate tab or having it be a paid service is a real shame. On another note it has me putting in my pin constantly, not just when it asks you to verify every once in a while. It's every time my phone restarted and then for what seems like no reason at all sometimes. So it ends up coming up multiple times throughout the day, and then it's multiple times of putting my pin in.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,X X,"Revert back to the old view, where each person's circle is it's own solid color, and THEIR TEXT, NOT MINE, is highlighted in that color. We should at least have the option to configure this ourselves if you insist on forcing a design overhaul on everyone. Now you're configuring the app such that I cannot communicate via signal with people who don't have signal? Three goes the one of the main advantages of this app. Great move!",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Euclid Megara,"Noooo! You can't remove SMS support! The thing that makes this app so great is that all my texts appear in one place! When I convince friends to join Signal it's seamless! About 70% of my messages are encrypted, in part because it's so easy to bring people over! If you take away the SMS then the quiet integration of encryption is lost. That's a big loss!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jessica Duncan,I've used signal for a couple of years and never had an issue until recently. The app froze and would not function even after reinstalling. Lost all messages because the backup function would not work due to freezing. I've been forced to return to the factory installed messaging app. Will give it a try another time when the issues are resolved. I've noticed many have experienced similar issues around the same time - last Sept to early Oct.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,AAA LLL,"This was a fantastic app until the decision to remove SMS support. The unified SMS and encrypted message experience was FANTASTIC for managing messages and helped convert many people in my circle to using it. No one (myself included) is going to deal with multiple text messaging apps. What a terrible user experience. Signal has been great historically, but it's time to move on to something else.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,kea charmak,"I really appreciate this app and all the flexibility it offers. The one thing I'm really missing from it is the ability to pin a couple of posts to the top in a group. I want to be able to pin a calendar, a meditation and directions to different events throughout the month. Whatever's most current for whatever we are up to. I get tired of scrolling through trying to find things. ALSO...After being added to a group I'd really like to be able to see the old posts. Thanks!!!!!",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kelsey Marie,"UPDATE: Dropping sms messages makes this app obsolete for me. Mostly was going okay but recently it crashes or won't open often. If i leave it open and go to another window it won't let me come back to it, and forces all my windows to close when it crashes. Makes it a frustrating app to use. Edit: Recent updates have really improved performance. Using it regularly now with very little issues.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Brandon Ragland,"Works well and I can trust that the communication is secure. No one can protect you if the other party gives up messages or had backups on even though you're using time-out conversations. So in those cases it's best to know exactly who you're talking to and can be certain they can be trusted. As far as the computer IT security, Signal is safe and secure. As a software engineer, I trust this app far far more than other popular apps claiming to do the same. This app ""just works"" and works well!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jimmy M,"Started off well enough. Thumbs up for privacy. BUT, aside from dropping SMS (which is NOT GOOD!) it doesn't work AT ALL when sending/receiving messages, even with another Signal user when separated by less than a quarter mile. Might be my carrier, but it is really annoying, especially when it's a very important message.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Steve Buttner,Think this app is great. Never gives me any trouble. Love the fact of the warrent proof end to end increption . Highly recommend it. Haven't used the video of voice yet so can't say about that feature. Takes your wallpaper. Multiple caller notification tones for each of your contacts. Can't think of anything I'm unhappy with. Of course like any app you must become familiar with it to be fluid with it. I'm happy with it which I can't say about a lot of my apps. Get it. Privacy is becoming lost.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A,"Excellent app lots of useful features. I am very disappointed to see SMS support discontinued. Although many of my contacts have Signal, many do not. The convenience of having a ""one stop shop"" for all of my messaging needs was fantastic. Unfortunately I think this decision will be very detrimental to the future of the Signal project. Granted SMS is inherently an unsecure protocol, most users are aware of this and will ensure sensitive communications are to a recipient with the app.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mari Schneider,A great app that can be used as a drop-in replacement for most other apps. It offers great security when messaging someone else with the app and falls back to unsecure messages when the recipient doesn't use the app. Edit: Signal will no longer support SMS messages. Basically you can *only* talk to other people on Signal. I will unfortunately have to uninstall Signal and find a new texting app.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,James Studer,"I really liked this application's ability to send secure text messages. However they recently decided to block SMS messages since they weren't secure. I will probably have to go back to the standard message app because I have to be able to communicate with a lot of my friends. Signal should just highlight the non-secure messages with a different color, like pink or something, to let the user know that say non-secure connection but Banning all SMS messages is a bit draconian.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jilly Bear P,"Unfortunately since SMS messaging will no longer be supported, I really won't be using it. As another reviewer stated, it is difficult to get other contacts to sign on to using a new messaging app. I was already frustrated trying to send short videos to non-users & getting ""message failed"" notifications. I had to switch to my old app to send videos in those instances which was a pain.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Firmino Martinez,"I was a little surprised by how easy the transition was in using this app, from the basic SMS app. I do wish I could import my conversation history, but that really only matters to me for the first few weeks, so I only had to switch to see what we were talking about earlier. After using this app for a couple weeks, I definitely recommend it. EDIT: the moment SMS support is discontinued, I'm uninstalling the app. It has little value without it, and I hate that I have to search again.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Nathan Harold,"The best modern messaging app. It's simple, clean, inituitive, and above all, actually private. Side note I recently had to transfer to a new phone and the process was both simple and fast. My other fifty-plus apps could learn a thing or two about backup and restore from Signal.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Carl R,"Edit: removed SMS, so dropped rating to 2 stars. Probably the best and most secure texting app out there. Telegram has had breaches and WhatsApp is owned by Facebook (hard no). Now with the new updates they've been putting out the last year or so, this has become not just the most secure, but the best texting app on the market! It's got everything you need, can do phone calls, can answer texts on your computer, can make groups or schedule when to have messages deleted!",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Larry ‚ÄúBrad‚Äù Prager,"Love it! Best messaging app I've ever found. 3/22 < Sadly, my opinion in the previous sentence is no longer true. Because Signal no longer supports SMS messaging I am forced to find an alternative messenger, again. I can understand the concept of wanting to make the continuing development of your app and easier process for yourself, I can also understand the concept of bringing about change, which you have to some extentl. But let's face facts. The MAJORITY, continue to support SMS messaging.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Timothy Eccleston,"This was a great app until they killed their killer feature, which was letting (Android) users send SMS in the same app, which made it so much easier to track normal conversations. Now I've been driven out to look for SMS apps and found ones with better UI. I care about encryption so I don't want Signal to tank, but I wouldn't be surprised if this does it. :( I've already gone from promoting and donating to this app to neither, but that would change if they brought SMS back.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,robvc7,"Removing SMS support is why this app gets one star. I love the security of Signals end to end encryption. But not everyone I talk to is interested in downloading a separate app. That's what made Signal so awesome. I could have the secure conversations with some and keep texting with everyone else all in one convenient app. With that going away, Signal is no longer convenient for me or anyone else I know. And since I refuse to use two different messaging apps, Signal will have to be uninstalled.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,shepherdgroup. biz,Stories. Bad idea. Don't need the garbage. And now it's crashed. Top marks for doing what they are doing. Not sure anyone would tell Signal if they've broken the codes but presumably there are plenty of independants out there that would love the publicity. The most important part for me is the privacy and efficient data use. Not worried about stickers etc but I'm sure many people are. As long as things aren't there by default and we always have the ability to remove features we don't use...,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chuck Anderson,"I mostly like the app, but I have two issues: 1. Why is SMS support being removed? 2. The way notifications work for group texts. There needs to be a way to mute notifications after the first time someone sends a group message, either for a time period or until the message is read. Otherwise there is a flurry of notifications when other people in the group are having an ongoing conversation while you may be busy and unable to read/reply. A total group mute isn't ideal.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Trevor Wunn,"Signal was perfect until they removed sms support. I was using it as my default messaging app, but I can no longer do that. It's extremely disappointing they've chosen not to continue with the support. I literally cannot convince everyone I know to switch to signal, a big selling point was to have it replace your main messaging app and they've gotten rid of that. Unfortunately, I'm going to remove it as go back to messages.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Panda Greenwell,"Went from being my favorite to most of my friends who used it uninstalling it after they stopped sending to SMS. Now, it won't open, just sits at the load up screen, and if I send a picture or something directly, it takes more than one try for it actually to go through. And who cares about the ""story"" function? This is FB messenger.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Hyperbolic ‚ÄúHaipa‚Äù The Artist,I used to be able to send videos. I mean yeah the options still there. But now no matter HOW short I cut them they just dont send. I used to be able to send them in 5 min segments. Then it was cut to 2Min 30Sec segments. Now it doesn't matter if its just a couple frames I cant send a video period. And before you ask. YES I CHECKED MY INTERNET CONNECTION. I have 4g LTE 3-4 bars CONSTANTLY. Thats very good and solid yet I cant send a 30 second clip over it? neither can my boyfriend on WIFI.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Don Turner,It's too bad that Signal developers have decided to remove the SMS feature. Removing functionality often forces people to find other solutions. It's still a good option for encrypted messages and international discussions outside of building a private server. Sadly I do not want to use two apps and will have to switch to another application.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jason F.,"I very much appreciate that texts are encrypted. With Big Tech and information all over the place, a reliable texting app is very convenient. It's quite the useful app too: audio texts, video calling, in-app photography, and more. However, there are occasional slight bugs with the chats: they may jump around, or the background may randomly change colours when you swipe. This stuff is forgivable, but video calls can lag and get pixelated. Other than that, this app deserves a solid 4-star rating!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Marc Kan,"It is great as long as both parties are on Signal, but if not, one or both of you may not ever receive the messages and you don't know until you talk to that person again. Switching in and out of Signal requires choosing it as your primary messaging which is highly annoying. I'd rather it were a stand alone like WhatsApp. Group texting is a nightmare with unending notifications and MMS failures showing up as individual messages from each person outside the group chat as well as in. Please fix",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,P E,"It mostly works. No matter what i enable, i don't get notifications untill i open the app. By that time i can see that i have a new message. I now have to remember to open this app to see if i have messages from the few friends that use it. I can turn off notifications and back on. They work for a day or so then go back to not working. Very frustrating.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Joe,"Works Great! You can send encrypted messages, self destructs messages, and regular texts (if default app). The only downside I would say is that it broadcasts your number being on Signal to contacts. This isn't a social media platform so I would prefer an option for privacy. With that being said, you can change your Signal number to any phone, even landlines so the possibilities are endless.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,John Kulju,"Very good messaging app. Does what it says. I used WhatsApp for 9 years before discovering Signal, and initially thought WhatsApp was better as there are functions I didn't see on Signal. After using Signal for a few months though, the only dislike I can remember is that it shows message time as how many minutes have passed, rather than the actual time of the message. Depending on your outlook, and whether you chat across time-zones, this could be a plus when referencing a previous message.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jacques Clouseau,"I may get rid of this app soon. Used to be great. Heard they are going to force their app on your contacts that don't have it to work, but only for Android users; guess ios users get a pass (shame, shame). Constantly crashes while sending photos. Asks to resend and fails. Have to reboot phone to send them and that's iffy at best. For another strange reason, I can't send large files or video that other messaging apps can, and it's not the apps settings either.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Generic Dude,"It's one of the most recognizable secure messenger platform out there. Runs smoothly, without any real problems. It's probably doesn't have much in terms of problems due to it's simplicity. There is no video chat or voice chat so there's a lot to be desired if you want more. Telegram or Element, would be better for those seeking more then text communication.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,badger codes,"It doesn't make sense for us to keep using a messaging app that we can't send text messages from. Having time to tell our friends who don't have Signal that they should add a second messaging app, and then keep track of who has Signal and who doesn't, is a hard sell. For those of you who are as dismayed as I am, Telegram is feature-rich, and I believe the is a plugin in F-droid that will let you use it for text messages as well. This really sucks, though. Farewll, Sig, after many years.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Joseph Sampson,The latency is terrible. Sometimes up to 15 minutes for just a normal text message to go through showing double checkmarks of delivery. All other types of chat Messengers are going through just fine to the same contact. This is happened on multiple devices consistently for a long period of time. I was hopeful that this was going to be my new messaging service app.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Crystal Rios,"Love the app, but since the last update, some of my messages will give me a failed delivery notification, but will send with no problem when I resend it. Idk why it's doing that now. It's a bit annoying. This is on a Samsung s10 of that helps. *update 10/16/2022* So it feels like the messaging has gotten worse. Now most messages give me a failed to deliver error and I have to resend once or twice for it to actually send. Can you look into that?",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chelsie Smith,"Amazing experience for past 2 years, however with the regular SMS messaging going away, I will have to find another messaging app and honestly may get rid of Signal all together. Right now Signal is a one stop shop for all my messaging needs. I can't force people to download ""one more app"" because I would prefer to use it during our messaging. So disappointed.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Drew Graybeal,"Opportunistic encryption has always had the highest chance of succeeding in populations that don't actively seek it out (see https and imessage). Signal's dual use of both encrypted messages and sms function did this. Unfortunately, the small number of contacts I have that also used signal isn't worth keeping the app installed on my phone. Deleted my account, and will be looking for a different solution that provides opportunistic encryption for SMS.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tyler,"Love this app. It's genuinely the closest thing to a universal iMessage out there. And it doesn't hurt that the company who runs it isn't evil (looking at you Meta and Apple). I can send large files (videos, pictures, etc) without loss of quality, make both voice and video calls, and send messages encrypted end to end between Signal users. I've removed a star however because they are dropping support for SMS. I was nice to only need 1 app for all my messaging needs.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Daphne,"Sometimes call quality isn't as great, but overall prefer it to Whatsapp for private messaging! Also love how you can change the color scheme to suit your phone theme. And I find the 'Note To Self' feature really useful which I've pinned to the top of my chat thread. I would like to have a Signal web version though so I can easily access my messages on my computer from any browser.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mahlia Maverick,I've used signal for a long time across several different phones. Today it's suddenly had issues trying to create backups and just got the notification it won't be able to receive sms messages. Ridiculous. I should be able to get other messages that aren't signal to signal apps. Not down to use multiple messaging apps. Not happy.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Brennan Murphy,Extremely disappointed there will no longer be SMS support. Makes it that much more difficult for non-tech family & friends to communicate. Most people aren't going to navigate multiple disparate messaging apps and will default to preinstalled SMS. Fracturing this ecosystem helps no one. We'll be back to blue bubbles vs green bubbles once again.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sly Cedix,"The removal of SMS is the worst step this app could have taken. The major draw for the layman was opportunistic encryption. By forcing users to use two apps like all the other e2e messengers do, they are going to swap back to SMS in full, not paying attention to who is on signal and who is not. After this, I'll be going from approx. 80% of my regular conversations being on signal to almost certainly 1 or 2 conversations max.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jeff Murphy,"Used the app for years, loved it being a one-stop-shop all for all of my messaging needs, both secure & unsecure. It also made it easy to get other people on board. I'm disappointed they are dropping support for SMS & MMS messaging. Hate having to go back to using two apps to be able to message all of my contacts.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Zach Briar,"While I understand the idea behind it, the decision to remove SMS support means it's pretty much impossible for me to convince anyone to start using signal. Without SMS functionality, signal it's just one of a plethora of closed-ecosystems with secure messaging. I was waiting to stop using signal hoping they will reverse this decision, when I saw they added a ""Stories"" feature. I don't need social media shoehorned into every app I use. I will not be returning to Signal.",1

Sad, looking for something better and more secure.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Adam Claussen,"Signal used to be wonderful. It was secure for signal to signal messaging, and it gave me the option to text unsecurely to all other people.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jesse,Signal is removing SMS support. This was the key feature that made this app useful for me as it allowed it to replace my SMS app and slowly encourage my friends and family to switch to encrypted messaging.

Prior to this, I would be able to use Signal as my default messaging app, allowing me to use it regardless of if I was texting someone who used signal or not. This meant that I didn't have to use 2 different apps to text. Now, it will only work when using with others who use Signal.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Cheapbullets (Sir Grim),"Signal is dropping SMS support which kills its biggest feature, all inclusive messaging app. Now it's a niche app for security that can only message other signal users.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A R,Don't bother if you have an android. They are dropping their app on android soon because people are getting charged for messages and a couple other extremely vague reason. A handful of people don't understand how to change between sms and signal and are being charged by their carriers. So they decided to cut out all of us that use android. I hate Apple phones. Most my conversations with my work group is via signal and half us have android. All of us are switching apps vice half switching phones.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Yaseen L Meridja,"Great app, love the security and usability. Recently moved from kakaotalk and don't think I'll look back. Will give 5* if not for the fact that it's missing a few features. A crucial feature is the ability to preview the stickers before sending them, at the mo to see them in their full glory we have to commit, another one related to animated stickers is to stop the animation after a certain number of times (maybe play every time the user is looking at it but then stop after playing a few times).",4

Can someone help?,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,james warner,Losing SMS support. Will be totally useless afterwards as very few of my contacts use signal. Not going to keep it for 3 people. Sucks because I really liked the app. Was a nice perk that some messages would be encrypted if the recipient had signal and if they didn't they would still get the sms. I think signal will be outlawed soon because the ratio of criminal activity will increase due to loss of casual users. Only people that will keep it will be those that need to hide from authorities.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rob,Doesn't load any contacts. Have tried all the ways on the support site and what I found on Google. Still nothing. Have emailed support but no reply yet. So for now the app is of no use to me. If I hear from support in the next 48hrs. I'll change my review.,1

It's a messaging app and you've removed a key function of messaging in favour of garbage.

Hoping to see more changes and more users in the future!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Justin McKay,"Removing SMS support effectively kills this app for everyone I've convinced to switch to Signal so far. The reasoning on Signal's website makes no sense if you understand your phone contract and if you aren't freaked out by the non-zero risk of your provider seeing your texts.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Eric Larsen,Sms support removal is a bad idea and will result in many not using the app. Some secure communication is better than none. When 10% of my contacts use signal and the rest don't it's much more convenient not to even use the app at all. Very sad decision.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,J,As a Signal sustainer since sustainer came out. I'm VERY disappointed that Signal is losing SMS functionality. If Signal actually does this I'm not giving them money anymore. I hope this downgrade is indefinitely postponed & eventually left to be forgotten about before getting revisited in 5-10 years when SMS is mostly dead & few people are still using it. This compleatly kills the way I've been pitching signal as an all in 1 messenger. I can almost guarantee most people will just use SMS inste,1

To get message & inbound calls to alert in real time, permit settings for Signal to stay awake/run in b/g (varies phone to phone). If not, you'll only be notified if it's already open, or next time you do. This is normal: your default phone & SMS functions are apps too, so they auto run in b/g or they'd do the same.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Vasilije B,"Signal is a great app overall, and it had crystal clear call quality. For some reason, it's really bad now. Disappointed.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Remo Nyffenegger,Why introduce Social Media functionalities like stories? There also is a demand for a simple messanger without having to have the feeling to be on Instagram etc. Rather introduce more useful stuff like polls.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shocks,The best private messenger with a beautiful interface that everyone should download. An app that values privacy is an app that doesnt profit off your data. That is signal.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Beach Katt,"Love the we app. I donate. But... Have you changed the 40 digit passcode for restoring?? impossible. Unsatisfactory. No other app requires that, just the local file on your phone or cloud.....",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rama,I know why they are splitting the sms and signal messages. I just signalled someone who had no data and missed a meeting because they had no data and were texting me but I didn't know. Signal should change the colour of the messages instead though.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Grace Thompson,Overall great app. The only reason it's not 5 stars is notifications don't come through when you're receiving a call or a text. Otherwise great app.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Veronica Tadman,Great! Only downside is where it is so secure it doesn't like sharing external links/docs/audio.,5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Man Amd,I don't like these changes and my usage is going to be 0% now. Daily updates. Addition of Stories. Removal of sms. No one uses it in my circle.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Samuelito Hinson,It is meh. Nothing exceptional and nothing horrid. Just another messaging app. I am not a big fan of the pin check. I feel it is useless in my application.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Antony Ochotorena,I like signals app very much. Alway good to be in private. You don't get no one to bother you from anybody / no advertisement that's one thing I like about Signal the best and I will give it five ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,P Gallardo,Signal is a great project that proposes an independent non-profit developer that put first privacy rather than focusing on selling personal data. The app has still room for improvementt but I think the project should be 5-star rated.,5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mathis Demay,"I like private messaging, and Signal does it well. Although it's too bad the user needs to have a ""smart""phone and not just a computer. Why did you do this choice ? Also, after crashing for a while it is back to normal. Yay !",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,WebFlyer0,"I didn't like the addition of ""signal stories""(a private messanger shouldn't encourage it's users to develop a habit of regularly sharing their daily life to groups of people).

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,August Yadon,"For the most part the app is great! I just really don't like when people don't receive my messages. It's probably more negatively impactful to my life than any other app. People will just not get my texts if they previously installed signal and are not using it anymore.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Matthew ‚ÄúBeanz‚Äù Romano,Would've rated 5 stars but your removing sms support meaning I no longer have a 1 stop chat app and I'll have to juggle conversations. Silly mistake after being so successful for years. Very disappointed.,1

Hello hello.' I hear them but they can't hear me. Then it disconnects. I have used Signal since Open Sytems created it and this has never happened before in all these years. It makes no sense,1

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mona Tambe,Didn't know that signal app doesn't back up the chats; felt terrible for losing family's chats.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Dave,"This otherwise excellent app loses a star due to SMS group chats. Sometimes group chats don't get used for a while and get lost. I will often create a new chat with the same people but I experience odd behaviour. Eg. a text will send via the old group chat and new msgs will come into the newly created chat. In my default text app, when I try to create a new group with the same contacts, it will simply pull up the existing chat instead of create a new one. This is the preferred behaviour.",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kai Muran,A debate between 4 and 5 stars. The encrypted messaging cannot be overstated in importance. Some minor buggy parts that are mostly annoyances (not getting notifications consistently despite not changing settings) but it's free encryption for texts,5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Himabindhu Sakamuri,My only complaint is I wish I could receive/send my normal text messages on the desktop app as well. Maybe you can do some kind of proxying/ bridge thing through the app on the phone. You know Google's messaging app has a web interface option that lets you send and receive SMS from the desktop. I'm not saying you have to do it that way but I am saying add normal SMS text messaging to the desktop app please!!!,5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,TheVirus1984 HOGReDwOlF84,Y'all's app is straight garbage. Every few months it force stops and can't even open the app at all. Even with an update it continues. Regardless of how it's approached. Fix this issue and it would be a better app.,1

When it functions as a conference calls medium, it is second to none. The images and characters one interact with are so visible and look like real, the audio is audible. One to one local and international call are uninterrupted. In other words, it is very comfortable to chat with people no matter where they are located at the time of of calls.",5

A lot of people may not understand this which is why they suggest a cloud based server for profiles and such. But that defeats the purpose of the end to end encryption.

It is not possible to switch between my video and my friend's video as the main video on display. 3. When I answer a call from my sim card, the signal call is not put on hold and both parties can hear what I'm saying which makes things confusing.",4

I guess it is the price to pay for privacy and security. 2) the app on my phone does not sync, so I do not get notifications of new messages ; only when I open it I see all the new messages. This is very very annoying.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Clarenz James Caba,"Signal is great. I appreciate the E2E encryption and privacy that they offer! The sound is great and video calling is seamless. There are a couple of features that I think should be in this application. For one, the camera should be off when I turn off the screen.

For now, I'll keep it at 3 stars until some features that I think are necessary to stay competitive roll out.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andy W,"Mostly great, but has a few flaws. Messages can be a little slow to be delivered and the video calling audio is fairly terrible.

Is it possible that when you change the group name or picture for that group that its visible within the app and if pinned on the screen? It makes it hard to differentiate groups. Also can you add a pin to top option for chats? That also would be helpful. Sending larger videos or data chunks would also be awesome. Thanks!,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Robert Anderson,"Like a lot of people on here, I've moved to Signal as an alternative to WhatsApp. Though I've not been using it for long (again, like many, I'm having trouble convincing others to move), the experience so far is a positive one. Despite being seen as 'more specialist' than WA, it's equally as easy to use, with simple and intuitive UI. A feature like Stories would be nice but, overall, am very pleased.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"I love the privacy of this app. I do a lot of audio clips. I love the option to cancel before sending, making the audio any length, and the option to lock the mic while talking. Problems are minor. My Nokia 5 phone doesn't show how long my audio clips are. Also you have to start each audio that you receive individually. Other apps will run them continually until you have listened to them all. You can forward video clips. There is no option to make video clips. Overall I'm happy with this app.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Geheimagent X,"Best private messaging service ever and constantly improving. Nice one Moxie!! Only a suggestion concerning to video files. If the file would be able to keep its original resolution once it's sent, that would be perfect. I'm pretty sure that not so much time ago was the same with pictures, but not anymore since a relatively short period of time. I guess your team and you are more focused in security and privacy matters which is Signal's primary concern. Alright, just pointing that as a reminder.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Michel Malek,"this app is an amazing Whatsapp alternative. As many have pointed out, the emojis are low quality. But what they lack in emojis, they more than make up for it in the better quality Video and Voice calls as well as voice notes. the IU of the voice notes is amazing as it makes it much easier to control like your average media player. Another thing it lacks is in-text format, meaning you can't make your text bold, italic or barred. But it can easily be added in the future.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"I enjoy the security and the commitment to privacy. There can be some glitches at times which require a reinstall to resolve. This is necessary when messages fail to be delivered to one or more recipients, and on occasion messages may not arrive. These occurrences are few and far between, so generally not a problem considering the app is free from adverts etc.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Hareesh N. Nampoothiri (Haree),"Signal app is very useful. The SMS integration and 'Note to Self' are useful features. The backup and sync with desktop doesn't work very well. Agree that it's for privacy and security, but an option to switch devices and sync devices (may be using Google drive) will be a good option to have. Those who want it may use it. Also I miss status update, it's a simple way to update something and only those who are interested may check them (rather than forwarding it to all separately).",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,Overall a great messaging / calling app. It does everything I need in that regard. Though moving to a new phone was really annoying as the backup/restoration process is not suited for it. I moved to the new phone and importing the backups from the other phone would have meant doing a lot of manual work. Also group chats did not show up until someone wrote in them,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"It's simple, in terms of features and the bells and whistles, if a bit lackluster but simple can be good. They do seem to be adding features though and the updates are pretty regular. It's probably the most secure messaging app out there that hasn't sold out. I don't really like the desktop app as much. Syncing messages can be an issue: no messages show up or it can take a while before they show, and sometimes there are no notifications on the phone when using the desktop app.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"I want to like this app. There are just a couple of issues. I had it on airplane mode while travelling and when I turned airplane mode off I did not receive any messages that were sent to me during that time. If I have closed the app, I sometimes don't receive messages until I go in to send one. Happy to send details to the developer. Otherwise it's clean and easy to use.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rebecca Tmg,"Very user friendly and simple. But a feedback : it takes a lot of time for the attachments to load. For eg, if I am trying to attach an image on a chat, the gallery just won't load, making it difficult to know what pic or video we are sending. Also, once the pic is selected, it takes more than 15-20 minutes for the pic to upload and go. This brings delay in communication. Please do enhance your media, so that we can peacefully start using Signal without missing other apps.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Hadi Mah,I want to give it 5. But there still some features missing and not completely stable. Like the ability to remove specific colors for each person in a Groupe chat. There is also a bug in this last version that crash the text messages import tool. Right now it sometimes laggy and some messages won't send correctly. But we just need to gives them a little bit of time. It's hard to respond to the sudden big demand. I have hope it this app and I thank you for that.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Bethan Pfeiffer,"In most ways it works like WhatsApp and is fairly intuitive. Advantages: security; the fact that you are a consumer not a product; note to self feature; pin reminder. Disadvantages: currently no Chromebook app or web version so I can only use it in my phone. Storage is only on phone- there is an option to back up, but it is not easy to do. Media- when you press on the plus button, it gives an option to add pictures from your gallery, but shows no thumbnails.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Michael K,"Happy to be able to use this secure messaging app. Also the design is great! However I still encounter sometimes issues with delayed notifications (especially when receiving calls).

So I need to do a call by creating a separate group and having a group call. I would even like to have a better appearance settings through which I can have some good chat colour and background options. But still I would continue to use it because it's better than any other messenger app in terms of privacy and some other features.",4

However, the fingerprint lock doesn't work all the time. In fact, it works only once while opening the app for the first time when one restarts the phone. It should ideally work evertime one opens the app. Kindly look into this issue. Additionally, add 'Note to Self 1', 'Note to Self 2' and so on. Thanks.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,jean Sidwall,"It works well and if you're security minded I believe this is the messaging and call app you should get. I use it for both for regular texts and its own services, so my main service. What I don't like is that when calling over WiFi signal also uses mobile data, meaning that if you're not aware it will use it up quickly. You can turn mobile off, but its a bit annoying to do it every time you want to make a call over WiFi.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"The app is great. I've convinced my coworkers family and friends to use it and we all are slowly moving out of Whatsapp. Great security, great End-to-end encryption for calls and text messages, great look and feel. The only thing which I personally would like to see in this app is a much user friendly UI. For instance when I want to reply for a particular message, I need to press hold on that message and then click on reply and then type the message. If this is simplified, it'll be really great.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"A lovely app to use! Everything works flawlessly so far and it gets the job done right and quickly. I haven't experienced any delays during the conversations. Some tips: 1. Please add conference calls on mobile, let's say 4 people max for the beginning. 2.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"I've had Signal, for a long-time, I installed this app, primarily for its encrypted abilities, after I learned over the years about being monitored by just about everyone and his brother. But, I find the continual ""updates"", to be annoying, Signal, will shut you down, if you don't update. The so-called improvements, as a result of these updates, are in my opinion, ""superficial"" and irrelevant! Regardless, it's a capable and secure app, even though, I do not appreciate their dictatorial approach!",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Michael P,"Great app! A minor suggestion; when you want to quote a specific bubble within a conversation it would be more easy to have the ""reply, delete, forward"" etc bar-option on the bottom of the screen instead on the top. Phones are getting bigger and bigger so being on the top is not so handy, you have to do some (dangerous) maneuvering in order to reach it, specially if you want to handle the phone with one hand. Its a single fix and it would be way more convenient! Anyway, keep up the good work!!!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Srinivasa Thirumalachar,"Coming in from WhatsApp, there is a difference in look and feel, features. I felt screen width is constricted. One tends to do everything being done there. One thing I liked about signal is videos play by default. Useful to glance at, when lots of similar videos arrive. Ok, this is not by default. It suddenly jumps to the end. Maybe needs to be fixed.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,cedric,"After one year, I finally decided to leave Signal... I never managed to have the desktop app working properly (only half of my contacts are sync), and, most of all, there is no way to export/backup my messages out of signal, which makes me highly dependent on this software editor. Going back to android's message app, at least I'm in control of my own stuff.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Castro,Overall experience was good as I'm all about privacy which has made me make it my main texting and media sharing app. Tho there are 3 issues I'd like to address: 1. Media sharing size is very less. 2. It takes too much time to deliver either text or media message. Should be an option to compress the size of a picture. 3. Can't save multiple media messages at the same time. Gotta save one by one. If not for these issues I'd have given it 5 stars.,4

The UX must become more user-friendly and aesthetic. 3 stars for not being able to send to multiple users by selecting on Signal. No option to select files to share from outside the app (only Signal search is available). Most importantly, I don't receive notifications for new messages. New messages pop only after I open the app.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Steph Bolduc,"Recently made the switch from WhatsApp - so far Signal is just okay. One major flaw is the app does not allow you to send full quality photos or videos, something WhatApp does allow you to do. Also, it automatically scans your contacts and notifies you when people are on Signal, which I would consider quite invasive. For an app that values privacy, it seems like a strange move. At the very least, you should have the option to decide which of your contacts you would like to notify.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kevin W.,"In the beginning I thought this app was good. Easy to use. Secured messages. Everything is fine. But lately messages get delayed from a few minutes up to hours! Even right now I have two messages send to different people where it only shows the symbol for them being received by the signal servers but not yet relayed to the respective receiver. Happened to multiple other people I know, too, so I can rule out that it's only because of my/their phone/s. This way, right now It's pretty much useless",2

Sending images doesn't really work on my device. Whenever I try to send media files, the gallery will just show a grid of black squares. They can still be sent, but selection is just a guessing game. Might be due to the amount of media on my device (~80GB images and videos), but other apps don't have similar problems. I hope Signal can improve here.",3

I like its interface though more can be done to make it intuitive.",4

Other than those things I'm very happy with the app. I like the way one is able to integrate basic phone messaging to this app.",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sibanarayan M,"Okay, a lot of improvement is needed. This is a good WA alternative, but a meh in comparison to Telegram (in context of media sharing). I am not able to view all the media exchanged. Only the ones I have downloaded are visible. Also, media size is not visible. Media download can't be cancelled/paused once initiated. Hangs a lot too in case of group chats. What I loved is the minimalist UI and privacy. Personal messaging is smooth and fast.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Colin Nallet,"Great messaging app, very easy to use with some cool and unusual features such as disappearing messages or local back up. Some are missing to my opinion, such as stories and when i started a group call, the members were not notified of the call. I'm sure the developers will improve the app in thsi direction! I appreciate a lot to be able to use it on my laptop without being connected with my phone!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Has issues with notifying about new messages in several android phones, so sometimes you have to open it in purpose go check if you have messages and you could be late for important communications. Plus when you want to send pictures you have to send the one by one and you can't access videos to send them from the app but go to your gallery and select from there. Apart from that is a good app and is meant to be much safer for data protection.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Arash,"As a messaging app it works just fine. All the options are there that you might want to have. But video calls are problematic. While the video quality is great the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. There are muffled voices, you hearing yourself while talking, and beeping noise similar to sonar going on! I'm sure these will be fixed in upcoming updates though.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Al Packer,"The best messaging app by far. Secure end to end messaging, video & voice calls to other Signal users. Also, you can text, call or video any of your contacts even if they don't have Signal. Plus you are a customer, not a product to be exploited. More bells and whistles being added on a regular basis. Switch over to it and invite your friends to do the same. You can't go wrong!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,C-M Oates,"I love the privacy status of this app and the look and colours. However, notifications of new messages are unreliable in showing but then it notifies you of them once you have opened the app and you can already see them by then! I would also like to be able to disable the ""swipe left to delete a conversation"" function as it is too easily done by mistake. Tweak these issues and its a great app!",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Cristina Soresini,"Generally speaking I like this app. I do have a few issues with it. When I'm recording an audio message, if I receive a call or a reminder pops up on my cell, I loose my message. On whatsapp that never happened. Calls and reminders would stop the recording but the message would still be there ready to be sent. Also there seems to be some kind of issue with videos.. maybe with the weight. I use a Samsung S8.",3

I also like the fact that there is a Desktop version of the app. Voice call was clear and simple to use.

Another thing is the messages are delivered kinda slow, which kills the mood in a chat. Thank you.",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ramya Vaidya,It is pretty good so far. I suppose they hadn't expected so much of foot fall since the WhatsApp debacle. Some issues with the network connection and the calls keep dropping. But I suppose they will get better now that a whole lot more people are on it. All in all good app. Also like the look of it. Not busy at all. Eye goes to the text and done. No background noise. Simple. Hope they keep it that way.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,sandeep singh,"The app is very simple but I like it. But the interface needs to be improved. And sending messages take a bit of longer than other messaging apps.

I hope you are working on this....",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chris Hippo,"Impressed with overall usability, plenty of modern features to make the switch over from other apps easier. Video calls are a bit laggy and poor quality and it doesn't notify with my girlfriends Samsung watch, meaning she misses alot of notifications. Other than that it works just fine, I'm making the switch from Disa. Oh, and the security, some mumbling about that too.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chandani chand,I have recently started using the app. So far it seems good when it comes to privacy. No one will be minding your business when you are online or your last seen. Can be using the app without anyone to disturb when they see you active. That's a plus. For calls it's not working most of the time. That really needs improvement before the app can become a success. Calls are important to any app. Disappearing messages is another plus,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,The Creator,"The UI could be a bit more user friendly in some areas. Also, it appears there are 2 versions of the app, one for iPhone and one for Android with different features and modes of operation, would be nice if it was standardized. Lastly, status updates like whatsapp would be pretty nice. Otherwise, overall very good app, would highly recommend üëåüëå",4

Since some updates, my messages seems to not been sent and it takes forever to receive texts. It's a real pain in the *** because it can't be trusted. Even after three hard resets of my phone (OnePlus 5t), I still have the same issue... I don't know why and it seems that I'm not the only one having this difficulty with Signal. I'm hopping you devs will fix that problem soon.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Decent alternative to Telegram and WhatsApp, although there are few things which could be improved. I'd really appreciate if this app respects my phone's silent mode in case of incoming calls and also it should mute the ringtone if I press the volume button. Sometimes the notifications doesn't show up for call and message (no this isn't related to battery saver turned on). The picture viewer in chat has improved but make it 'drag down to close' like in Twitter and Telegram. It would be awesome if you could add stickers like Telegram has. It is probably the only feature that I really miss. Nonetheless, it's a very reliable app. I don't recall it ever crashing for me.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jacob Leguijt,"Wonderful app. Works just as well as WhatsApp and Messenger but keeps my information confidential - the way it should be. Only thing to know is that your messages are saved on your device - if you reinstall the app or move to a new phone you only have access to current messages under your phone number. The good part is that they aren't saved on a server harvesting your data, bad part is that you won't be able to look back on old conversations.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Dave Germain,"Moved over to Signal with the change to WhatsApl privacy policy and I've been impressed! It works really, integrates with SMS (optional) so I can eliminate my SMS app from my phone as well. Text chats, voice chats, and video chats all work very well. There is a bug when video calling with in landscape mode. If your phone has autorotate disabled, the app doesn't recognize when you disable it if you are already in a call. Fixed by changing the setting before starting your call.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Lucian Ivan,"This is a great app. I switched from WhatsApp and I found similar functionality, including the security aspect. However, there are still a few technical improvements which will likely be rolled out in the future, especially with the growing pool of users. For instance, useful features: forwarding Media to multiple contracts at once; last seen option.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Khushal Trivedi,"Better than That's App. The app is very secure and safe to use. The UI is very simple and user friendly. The file sharing options are good.

However there are some things that needs to be improved, like the app doesn't offer a seamless and butter smooth expereince.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Pratyush Kant Sahay,"The app is awesome. The privacy features alone makes it a compelling offering. But the best feature I found was the 'disappearing messages'. At any moment in the conversation you can go ""off record"", just set a timer and voil√†, you done. You can even have it permanently on. There are stickers too. But currently, the servers are on overload due to the sheer volume of people using it so it better to wait untill the servers upgarde till you migrate.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ketarel,"Sends texts and pictures just fine. I'd like to see some more options for customizing the appearance (chat bubble colours, backgrounds, etc). It's pretty barebones right now. I don't know how well the end to end encryption holds up, but I suppose I'll trust the devs until I have a reason not to. I trust just about anyone more than I trust Facebook anyway. So thanks for this app and keep up the good work, and please don't scrape my data and sell it to anyone.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jeremy Palmer,"Coming from WhatsApp this seems pretty similar in terms of user functionality. Had a couple of issues with some voice or video calls not being notified on the phone, but hasn't occurred over the last couple of days, so might have been something transient. Overall I would recommend as your data is better protected. My only wish is the desktop app would support Giphy.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kaushik Murali,"I love the app so far! It's great. The one thing I don't like and wish can be changed is - when you are in a conversation, regardless of light or dark mode, the header is a light material blue. It would be great if the devs can implement the feature to choose from a colour palette, or make it white for light mode and black for dark mode. The use of blue is just visually jarring. Otherwise really looking forward to using Signal!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Noorul Sharik,"It's a great app. Cons: There's some issues with video calls, it seems working better on other platforms. But not in signal Voice notes, don't know if the person read it. No status The web version is a little buggy. Pros: Great with privacy. Most of the features in whatspap are available here. Except for status. Texts. Groups. It's all there. The web version has audio and video calls enabled. It's perfect.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"New user here. No issues so far. Set up was easy. The 3 Star Rating is due in part to newness to the app and the broadcast to your contact list that you're now on signal. That is something I would have preferred control over. If that option is present, on a fresh install it wasn't apparent or the importance of that privacy option did not standout as it should have.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Amsterdam Love,"App is definitely great. Would have appreciated if there's an option to hide profile picture from people who are not saved in system's contact, but got saved in Signal's contact after accepting message request.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Surbhit Srivastava,It mostly works very well when it comes to text. I haven't yet tried video calls and voice calls since I don't use them much though others have expressed problems. The main problem it has for me is that it doesn't allow a second android device to be linked. If privacy was the reason behind this then Signal Desktop wouldn't exist so it's definitely just a missing crucial feature.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Great for secure messaging, voice and video calling also improved a lot from the early days. One super annoying thing though... If you reply to a message from the notification screen (because it's faster than going into the app), the notification doesn't dissappear. It just shows both the message and your reply now.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Anirbit Biswas,"The app's interface is brilliant. But there are a lot of limitations. First of all, there is no option of forwarding several texts or media at once; I have to do it one by one.

Please don't add a status option or something like that, Keep it simple. Try to make the customisation a little more user friendly and the chat screen require some revamps too. And the controls do need some color, they just don't look appealing yet.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Marco VonBlack,"I really want to like this app, and love that it is one of the few that allow for audio recordings over a minute.... But listening back to audio messages is an absolute nightmare. Unless I keep the app open and the phone's screen on, the audio will stop, but the tracker tells me the message is still playing. I've tried pinning signal to keep it open in the memory, but that has not helped. This is useless when it comes to trying to listen to my friends messages while going about any other task",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andre Brito,"Signal takes users' privacy seriously, which is how it should be. It struggles a bit when sending videos and I wish it could manage it better or at least prompt users to resend instead of displaying the wheel of death for hours.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"This app is amazing ! Extremely private and has a lot of customizable settings like disappearing messages and stuff. Ran into an issue when I added my friends Google account and it accidentally synced with signal even though I didn't want it to (all of my contacts got messed up and all of their names and photos changed to how she had it on her own phone, and I couldn't figure out how to change it directly from signal), but we fixed it by deleting my friends account and by redoing all of my name's in my contacts. It was annoying, but fixed :) Overall though, I think that signal is amazing and I definitely recommend it!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Devon Fyson,Nice that it's open sourced end-to-end encryption. However frustrating there is no web version and the desktop versions doesn't sync messages with the mobile app. This is a huge flaw as makes it unusable switching between them. Typing long messages is brutal without a keyboard. Once that problem is solved it'll be a much better replacement for Whatsapp.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Charlie Harding,Great WhatsApp alternative hardly miss it at all.... Just wish Signal had the android bubble feature (so I could keep tabs on messages when using other apps.) Also when I'm on a call but using another app. If I put my hand over the sensor at the top the screen still goes black (even when using headphones). Small things... But would be great if they were fixed. Also back images for chats would be a nice touch. Keep up the good work,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Allan,"The app is very comparable with WhatsApp. My main complaint at present is that when someone calls you, it either doesn't ring or when you try and answer the call, no matter how hard you try and click that green phone, always lose person. Have to try 2 to 3 times before you get through. Otherwise, very happy with the privacy it currently affords me.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Khushman,"Things to improve: 1. Doesn't show when people are online and last seen. 2. Doesn't show if a voice message was listened. 3. Can't set screen lock inactivity timeout less the 1 minute. 4. In the lock mode you can't see messages when swipe down from the top of the screen. I want just to see a message by swipe down the screen, and not to open the app, because if I open the app it will be seen that the message was read. 5. The app is slow, when you click on a chat it takes some time until it opens",3

One can't classify the whole experience as slow but not as instant as I would like it to be, from my experience with other messengers. Apart from that, great app and all the best.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Stephen P,I rated the app three stars simply because of the notifications. They are very intrusive and there doesn't seem to be a way of configure it so that the popups stop showing up over everything . It's very annoying when you're watching a video or playing a game and the popup notifications overlay on any active application. There seems to be no way to turn this off without completely shutting off notifications. You need to fix this ASAP.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Nadia Shivarova,"The app has been great so far and the video quality of calls is fantastic. I love the disappearing pictures option. One security flaw: you can disable screenshotting on a phone but when a disappearing message is viewed on pc, there is nothing stopping the person to take a snip of the disappearing picture when it's opened. Please find a way to protect disappearing pictures from being stored on PC. Thanks!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"I started using Signal about 8 months ago for contacts who didn't have Whatsapp, and as my primary SMS/MMS app. (Whatsapp requires other users to also have Whatsapp). There are three features that would make Signal significantly better.  My 'Gallery' has albums for 'Messages' (the default Google messaging app), 'WhatsApp Images', and 'WhatsApp Video'. But the only way to save the photos and videos from Signal is to tap on them and specifically save each one to your device, in which case they go into the album 'Pictures'. I absolutely hate having to do this for every picture. I would like there to be an option to automatically save media to the device in a folder. Barring that, having an option to download all media in a conversation to a folder.  Second feature: Whenever I tap ""See Full Conversation"" scrolling upwards can be very slow. It would be nice if the scrollbar on the side was grab-able so I could drag it much faster.  Third Feature: make it easy to export all your conversations and text messages. This shouldn't be hard. Don't try to force your clients to remain with you by holding their messages hostage.  Currently 4 stars, 5 stars if media export/saving.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sriharsha C V,What I like about it is the smooth transition between desktop and mobile experience. There are 2 areas of improvement: 1. The conversations on mobile app are visible on desktop but the sent messages on desktop are not visible on mobile app. I feel it is a bit inconsistent. 2. There is lag (sometimes in hours) between messages to sync between devices.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Pretty good, voice quality is great for calls (better than WhatsApp and Discord), night theme is nice. Not sure why but it always ticks a bit of mobile data even when I'm on WiFi so I have to shut mobile data off before I use it for voice. Also, my screen continuously blacks out at seeming random when I'm on a voice call and want to switch to other apps, which makes it difficult to multitask. If those two things were fixed I'd give it 5 stars.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Omar,"I love that it exists, but it's not for me. I really like that security is taken seriously, but usability does take a big hit. You can be secure and convenient at the same time, and that's not what signal is. Here's my experience: I wanted it to replace SMS, but i never got the promt to import. Either way, any new SMS would only be saved inside signal and be gone with the app without the inconvenient backup system. It could be a seamless transition from sms compared to WhatsApp",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,lolly hunter,I'm a fan of Signal as an alternative to Facebook-run alternatives. My only issue is that when sending and receiving voice messages they often don't come through at the time of sending. It's only when one of us sends a text message that it seems to push the voice message through. Is this a bug that can be sorted? I'll upgrade to five stars if it's fixed! üòä,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Many Spanners,"Works great but when a contact has more than one number, Signal shows them as separate contacts. Each one is labelled with just the contact name so they look like duplicates. I wish it would add ""home landline"", ""work mobile"" etc. to the labels. After a struggle I discovered that you can see the phone number if you click on the contact's picture, not the label text. Extra clicks each time you want to message or phone one of these contacts!

However, after using the app for awhile, the notifications stopped coming through until the app was opened, and messages were subsequently missed. Cut a long story short - a lot of time has been wasted trying to fix this, and the support files text doesn't match the phone actual Settings modules.

It will definitely substitute WhatsApp. No ads , no promotions, no data marketing... But lot of User Interface (UI) enhancement required according to the simple user friendly approach. It is better to have a UI , just like in WhatsApp , in order to increase the popularity. The ""+"" button need to be replaced , with the usual ""paper clip"" button as in other popular apps. Also , if we are trying to attach a document, it displays image files. Images have to be displayed only with gallery, not with documents list in attachment section. Also video / audio calls, group calls may be provided with a separate tab for easy user friendly UI. Now the location of call button can't be identified to the new users. The deficiency of STATUS button or tab is of course a big cons of the app... However , thinking of security and privacy , SIGNAL is a very good app. Hope it will become number one...Congrats..",4

The app doesn't have much purpose without that.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Hader Wael,"A second review from me, had more things to talk about. I do think this will be successful but it really lacks some basic needs while it has some features we never thought would be a thing like 'blur faces' or 'download photo' or 'play one time'. Don't get me wrong these features are pretty cool but they don't serve as much an attraction when there are some basics left behind. Overall though, great app again, though it could be much more enjoyable with 'gifs' and more appealing emojis.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Margreet Polinder,"Has bugs when it doesn't send or receive messages for a while. The main purpose is messaging right, so if you don't know if you'll get those, it doesn't work for me.

Still not smooth in every way, but good for messaging!",4

Used for a while and have faced no problems. On the matter of privacy, there can't be even a small doubt about Signal, it's really private. It's voice and video call quality is stupendous. I really like the way it's designed. It meets almost all the requirements to be the best messenger application. Using Signal will really make a difference for you. Highly recommended!!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,art gardener,"Love it but I don't see a notification that stays viewable anywhere from my home screen if I miss a msg or call (I have to click into the app to check). Thanks for a good app, although after reading reviews about how our info is stored on Signal's servers when there seems to be no need to force this compromise of security (?), I can't be entirely happy with the privacy aspect. It's easy to use and I like that I'm still able to send messages to or call people who don't have the app installed.",3

A bit more attention on the calling function required.",4

While listening to a message, if you are not using the phone it still autolocks and stops playing the message. Once you unlock the phone and continue playing. It starts from the begining.

When I send a message to a friend, it won't get delivered if the person hasn't open the app yet even though that person is not offline. Also please allow the option to store sent and received images and videos directly to gallery, it would be easier if there's a way to turn on/off such feature. Sending photos and videos in this apps takes ages. I would definitely use this app in the long run if it improves. Please kindly take note of this.",4

When calling you sometimes can have a network issue preventing to answer or start the call, which is less of an experience, however when it does connect the quality is a lot better than any other similar apps. Back ups are not incremental but always a full backup so keep that in mind. As said however, I like it and have confidence these things will get better",4

Sometimes it shows in notification bar as incoming call which I notice if I have my phone in hand. Other times I just get notification pop ups that I missed the call - when it didn't even ring. Hope signal team fix this issue!! Another suggestion on lower priority would be to add call history and duration of calls. Else it's a great app! Thanks",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shyam Sundar G,"Wonderful app but, not sure if it's because of OEM optimizations or not, (1) the app doesn't run in the background like WhatsApp. And due to that, notifications are not received until the app is opened again. (2) On exiting the app (with the back button), unable to enter via the task switcher. Otherwise, it's much faster and smoother than many messengers.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,t vahabi,"Great app. but I've got some suggestions. Lower the animation time. The first time I worked with signal I thought my phone had a problem but as it turns out the animation time (i mean the animations you see when you click on someone's profile or...) is way too long.

And Please for the love of God, don't show deleted messages.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Bas Holten,"Excellent replacement for all messaging services. The fact that it can handle both regular SMS text messages as messages from other Signal users means you will only have to use a single application.

This is actually great, but it would be nice if there still was some (safe) way to manually import conversation history.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kevin MacW,"Great little messenger app with a focus on privacy and end-to-end encryption. Since WhatsApp was sucked up by Facebook I've been looking for an alternative, and this fits the bill. I don't miss any features from WA, though I haven't fully investigated the groups feature in signal. File sharing is very easy, with an expandable interface next to your chat entry. All in all, great app, would download again.",5

The second I started using it on multiple devices I started getting major sync issues, sent messages would not appear elsewhere and I stopped getting notifications. The only way to fix the issue was to delete the app and redownload, but the problems continued.

The ringtone volume is extremely small, even though I put my all volume into maximum. I am not sure this situation only happens me or not. By the way, my phone is ROG phone 3. Besides, the setting in signal can be more user-friendly. It would be great if there is a FAQ section in help section.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Stefan Kamer,"Excellent and user friendly app! Has all the features you really NEED in a messenger and is truly secure and private! Love it! Only thing I believe need attention is the following: - A more comprehensive and user friendly Backup / Restore solution.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kerstin P,"This is the only app I use for messaging, and I'm not missing anything. It's great, does what I need it to do and does what it can to NOT collect data about my conversations. The only thing I struggle a bit with is the backup functionality.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Yasmine Megahed,"This is an amazing apolication for chatting and calling (audio, video). I've done some research after WhatsApp's last modifications that violate users' privacy. Signal doesn't share data because it doesn't collect it. It's an open-source app, so that end-users are allowed to check its functionality. Its messages are end-to-end encrypted. It's not a start-up, so it won't seek an exit like WhatsApp with FB.",5

Update: seems like some temporary hiccup.  Well, privacy, cryptography and stuff is good, but I'm still not impressed by usability. It just does its job, but some UI behaviour is a little bit annoying.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Lynda O'Mahony,"Still lots of improvement needed. You can't see the message unless you open it. With the other apps, you can see the gist of th message before actually opening it. Also the stickers are bad. There should be a better choice.

Please hurry and us a better option so the world can away from Facebook products.....",2

Whilst infuriating at the time, it doesn't detract from the fact that the app is easy to use, has a few elements from other messaging apps like Line. I would like to see usernames as opposed to phone number, that way can use multiple accounts - work, personal, etc For the Devs, I'm assuming the slow down is a backup or capacity issue?",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Daniel Russell,"Pretty good app, fulfills most of the features you'd want from a messenger app pretty solidly. The only thing letting it down is it's tied to your phone number and you can't create one without that and also looking up your contacts. Would be good if there was an option to go off of shared secrets only like a QR code or something. Not personally a fan of the different colours per chat, though this could be solved if there was a more neutral colour added so you could just select that one for all",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rob Green,"Running fine so far. Annoying there's no ""click to send"" button on the desktop version. My keyboard and mouse are wireless so the keyboard isn't always near me. When I share images or files I have to go get my keyboard to send then go put it back again.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Will McDowell,"It's good. But it could do with some more creativity. The app itself is a messenger app, just like WhatsApp but without the major new Privacy Notice. It works great and is easy to use but there are a few design nags that irritate me. Chat colours are awful. They're sullen and a but grim if I'm honest. Not a big deal for most people but if you're staring at them all the time, being able to pick colours from the full spectrum or even just HEX or RGB colours would be much better as a start.",4

Signal now hasn't totally replaced WhatsApp unless it's headed there. It's also not easily sending photos..indeed some it's not sending at all or even making calls over the net, I wonder why. One good thing is that signal has no intrusive, unwanted ads or in-app purchases.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,T Khan,Many shortcomings with this app - 1. you can't forward a message to multiple people once. You can forward a message to a single person in one time. 2. No option to clear/delete chat history. You can set a time limit to clear a chat history after the recipient sees those very messages but even this option does not work properly and definitely. 3.

Contacts saved to Signal are unable to be edited which is an annoyance when contacts elsewhere are changed up and Signal keeps the out-of-date version. Calling out using Signal often results in receiver of phone calls being unable to hear the ring tone nor the voice of the person properly.

It works fine if the app is unlocked. Maybe this is intentional but it is not intuitive.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,pH,"This app has everything that other apps offer, plus better privacy and even performance. The only thing it does not have, but slowly getting there, is the ubiquity and scale that WA/FB have. Still most people i talk to were surprisingly receptive to the idea of making the switch and all my important contact did. So hopefully Signal becomes the norm soon.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kenneth Beard,"This App works as good as the more familiar WA but, at least for now, is not dictated to by one of the silicon valley giants. I encourage everyone to use many alternatives of every kind of application to break the monopoly level of control and abuse of your data and rights. In a position of such strength they can and will switch you off at a moments notice because they don't like the way you think. Don't get married to any software. Changing apps & remaining in contact with your friends is easy",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Omar Shubailat,"It is great as open source and no strings attached. The only point I have until now is forwarding the message is only to one person at a time. Besides, the videos I send they get uploaded to each receiver individually, this could be due to no copies are kept on servers, I would suggest at least to have copies for an hour or so.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Justin Hauck,"This is a good app and I will continue to use Signal, but currently there are several problems. I would love to be able to send multiple photos via SMS sometimes. I would love the option to call my contacts with Signal through my phone number instead of the Signal calling feature. It would be great to have more colour options/themes for chats. Sometimes pictures I send are not viewable by me, or are ""glitchy"" looking in app. Kinda annoying and looks messy.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jane Halliday,"While I love the privacy aspect, it still has a long way to go. First of all, it needs to function - send SMS properly, receive phone calls, and don't miss any notifications. If someone is calling me, I'd like to know. Next, needs a web browser. Whatsapp's is simple, you point the app at your screen once then it's always connected. I have a Chromebook and I Signal to be more accessible on there.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aaron Karat,"Generally excellent. The odd glitch, but they're getting less frequent and I'm willing to forgive that anyway because privacy is such a priority. The absolute best feature is not being able to see when other people are 'online' - always found that very invasive on other apps. Media generally works well, though it would be nice if they could keep a list of links sent in each conversation as well as images & videos.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Soham Chatterjee,"Okay..so this app is good, in fact very good in terms of privacy but there are some aspects in which it needs to develop soon. One of them is read receipts of messages sent in groups. When I send a message in a group, then if it is delivered to only one of the members, the status becomes delivered and same happens for seen also! This isn't a good thing! Apart from this, contacts in the mobile version are not getting updated (but they do on the desktop version). Status option can be added soon!!",4

Searching gifs to add is laggy.",4

And its my preferred messenger but I would like to suggest two Improvements, 1) that we have the option to store it on an external drive (ie SD card) because it's taking up SO much space on my phone it's slowing it down. It's by far the heaviest data app. 2) that the keyboard that pops up in the app has the return key added.

You need to register via phone number. No option for username or multiple phones.

There are some missing features with comparison to standard messaging apps, like message reactions, low number of contact colors, etc.",5

Overall its brilliant and am recommending to others,5

I use it as my default SMS app as well, however for people who have installed it once then never use it, when I send them a message they never see it. It should be sent as a text rather than an encrypted signal msg in this instance. Particularly if I did not actually know they had installed Signal and had assumed it would be sent as a text.",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,Decent texting app. Call quality is super awesome. Messaging experience is also nice. Apart from minor mismatch of shortcut functions like tagging a message. Video call is also decent. But Media sending experience is horrible. Pathetic. Does not sends a media file easily. Also subsequent text messages are also stalled because of this. Also in app camera freezes most of the time. Needs improvement for sure. But a nice hideout if you wanna run away from popolar crowded messaging apps.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ise H,"For some reason, even though all notifications are on, the app does not use the ring tone set to alert me when someone is calling; it only vibrates.

Additionally, it would be nice to be able to save individual charts to other apps, such as Word or email them.",3

Will keep on trying it out, but so far I am not comfortable with the overall experience.",3

Not easy to forward information. Hope to have a wonderful Signal soon.",3

However, it's a bit clunky and nowhere near as slick and reliable as WhatsApp. Sometimes messages take a while to go and the text message interface doesn't show up on the desktop app which is annoying as it effectively switches off your text messages on your phone although you get the choice. Hopefully it will catch up with the GUI of WhatsApp and become more reliable.",3

Tip for the users: if you want to support Signal, add them to your Amazon Smiles program",5

Small issue: if playing a voice note & click on another one, the previous one doesn't stop playing automatically.

What I like the most is that other users cannot see when you are online or typing and so cannot just bombard you with messages just because you happen to be online or get offended if you don't or delay responding... that is such a huge relief!!!! Also, contacts don't automatically appear on the Signal page. You have the choice to add them there. And then, of course all the privacy features the App provides! No fuss. No frills.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shahid Raza,privacy is good I like this app. there's a lot things you can upgrade like seen indicators tick box could be in green or some other colors.

I appreciate your work. Thanks,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Venu Kizhakkethil,"Might be a good substitute for WA if it make a few improvements. Groups usually have multiple messages on same subject from different people. Unlike WA, Signal does not have the facility to indicate the message I am replying to. That could be confusing in s group. No fowarding. That may be good to avoid cluttering other people's inbox but it may be better to leave that decision to the user, if Signal want to be competitor to WA. No copy paste either.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Angela Plah,"Love it. And most importantly it has nothing to do with Facebook. Still can do groups, easy to invite people you can merge with SMS.

And you get a notification when someone else in your address book joins signal which is happening a lot at the moment.",5

Didn't have any issue refreshing the contacts as mentioned in some of other reviews, might be specific to gadgets.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Frank Seydel,"Majors successfully on privacy, but it's not what it could be when it comes to versatility. There are other messenger apps out there that outperform Signal by far in functionality. I also don't like that you can only register on one device at time which is probably due to it's focus on privacy. So if you're focussing on privacy over function this might be yours. It works with end-to-end encryption and messages once sent are not stored in servers but the device they're being sent to.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Riaan.Mary-Anne Schutte,Really good app. Use it for texting and messaging. The recent theme change is not great though as people in a group used to have distinct colours.

Please improve or restore how it was.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Oleg Gv,"Things to improve: 1. Doesn't show when people are online and last seen. 2. Can't set screen lock inactivity timeout less the 1 minute. 3.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"seems okay so far. I heard somewhere that theres an issue with the desktop version, but I haven't used that, so idk. and probably they've fixed it, so you can't take screenshots of it (Netflix has this feature), and can't copy text from it to a notepad. but like most things, there will always be ways to circumvent the security, by those who wish to do so. I'm just happy they don't collect meta data, or save unencrypted copies of conversations.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Muntan,I've been using signal for a few months now and I really enjoy using it! A couple things I wish worked better is the synchronization with the desktop version of signal and more specifically the notifications. It would be awesome if the notifications that I receive on my phone would automatically go away if I read a message on the desktop version. (If you need 'inspiration' check out how messenger has implemented it) And please add gifs on the desktop version :) Thank you for all the hard work!,4

A couple of things need imporvement, and I will state them as cues: 1. I like the feature of not auto-downloading media. This way I can select which to download. But on the camera level, when turning to landscape mode, it would be good to have the capture button migrate to this side instead of the bottom middle, allowing a better reach for the thumb one-handedly. 2.

Even with internal storage (no SD card), it takes longer than necessary. 2) The bombardment of notification sounds while a message is unread until opened as well as while you're in a message string and receive a new message. In either situation a silent or more muted effect would be preferable. Funnily enough, Whatsapp doesn't have these issues...",4

Have also made sure that non of the notifications are blocked or turned off. 5 star app if this can be resolved.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,David Smith,I really like the look and usability of the app. The ability to customise chat colours is also a nice addition.

But i think these small issues will hopefully get resolved with incremental updates.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Karthikeyan Kaluvakolanu,"I loved app simplicity. Here's my feedback. 1. When Voice Call/Video Call is made, it is not appearing like normal call.

The biggest issue with signal is their moral opposition to allowing any message storing on the SD card. This means the app will bloat to multiple gigabytes over normal usage as it stores all of your messages. If you don't like it, you can delete old messages. No way to back them up though. You have to have the actual messages on your internal storage to back them up to the SD card. The developers refuse to allow Signal to be on SD.",2

I have nice steakers, emojis, everything needed. Recommended",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sarah Wassermann,"Two things that made me decide to never use Signal again: 1) If you want to switch back to the standard Android messaging app without losing your messages, you will have a lot of fun with figuring out how to do that. 2) The app kept crashing as soon as I started it, even after stopping the app and restarting my phone. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Problem: ALL my messages were deleted when the app was uninstalled without any kind of warning! Never again...",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Works as advertised, only catch is to have the encryption, both users have to be using it. Nice that it's open source. A minor bug I found is when you unlock your lock screen and try to type something in the reply field, sometimes nothing shows up. Keyboard letters pop-up as of you are typing but nothing is put into the app text box.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Not bad, hoping it will only get better. Main problem I have right now is sending an SMS to a contact as default, there is no option to set it. I am trying this out on a friends phone as the default messenger (SMS+Signal) and they will send Signal messages to other people who are also trying out Signal but aren't prepared to use it full time--they will not always have mobile data on and won't receive it. Or their messages will now be split between 2 apps accidentally. SMS failover will be nice 2",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Dylan Todd,Can't attach multiple pictures to one message. Can't attach contact cards. Very cumbersome and disappointing for a messaging app in this day and age. The app also stopped some SMS messages from getting through to me! I uninstalled and instantly started receiving SMS messages that were sent to me from days before! Signal blocked them! They have a lot of work to do if they're even going to think of competing with WhatsApp. Horrible app.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kiko Timajo,"Day 2 of having my account, and my friends are still not showing up on my contact list nor am I to them, regardless of how many times we refresh, remove and re-add our accounts to reset permissions, and have all numbers include country codes. Also tried uninstall/reinstall and repeated all steps above since yesterday, and still nothing. We just can't find each other. So, yeah, skip this. If a messaging app requires you to wait a day or two before you can start communicating, it's not worth it.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"A great app for privacy. Beats things like Telegram by being able to send SMS to contacts that don't have Signal, so essentially it can.completely replace your default SMS app. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that you can't send SMS from the desktop app like you can with the messenger program from Android. Other than that, it's perfect!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Epiko,"It's a great app for the most part, with nice features. But recently it has started having trouble sending my messages, making whoever I write to recieve messages up to hours after they were sent.

A bit of tlc with the call/video feature would make this app perfect.",3

For example: Every first video call I try to make in the day returns a ""Network error"", I need to try again, and the second attempt always works. Another thing to mention is the fact that when trying to share an image, the trim option has the locked layout by default. Please change that to the unlocked trim option by default.

Of course good for security too. Thank you for this app!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ivan S,"Great app security wise. Could use some UI design changes (it feels a bit ""thick"" yet feature empty compared to Telegram. Also addition of bold/italics/underlines would be much appreciated.

And soften that stark black and white contrasts in both the dark and light theme. Better UX (not stickers) can help adoption of signal and other privacy apps as default choices!",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Josh Miller,"Signal is a great app which has a perfect UI, design and feel. It's features are great and the security is the best and leaves me feeling confident and safe. The only problem is compatability issues with my S21 Ultra - any video calls on signal cause my phone to catastrophically overheat to the point the phone emergency shuts down all apps; at points the phone is so hot I almost burn myself on it. The problem isn't with the phone itself, but with the app as I do not have this issue anywhere else",3

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,rekolidu tazovipo,"While I definitely appreciate core values of Signal, the developpers started making bad choices. For example, the PIN is covering 2 fundamentally different functions. First, it prevents people from registering your phone number. This has a net security benefit. Second, it allows you to encrypt data stored online. Even though convenient, this has obvious security drawbacks. So, because the 2 functions are not independent, it ends up being an overall security regression. Also, many network issues.",1

Where I have two numbers for a husband and wife I can't distinguish them. They appear as Other even though they have custom labels.

I.e.; if deleting the app all signal messages are lost. 3) I should be able to opt into adding e.g. a ""this message was sent using signal"" at the end so friends learn about it on their own instead of me having to push it.

Apart from that is is such a good experience by far while using this app.",4

There is a lot of lag. Plus the calling never works. I can sit in front of someone and call but he does not get the call. A missed call notification comes much later. You can improve this feature then it becomes something to compete with what's app or telegram",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"I have been using Signal since 2015, and during the last few years this application has become the best messaging/communication option. Because Signal is not under any big corporation, the application is still faithful to its core value of proctenting privacy. The best part is that Signal doesn't lack of any of the features that the others commercial applications offer. And on top of that, no one is profiting from your data.",5

Other messengers may not read your messages, but what about the trust you give them in accessing your contacts, for instance? Functionally, Signal works well and is constantly improving. it also has less of the unnecessary fluff that you see in messengers. It does private messaging, and it does it well.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Abdoulie Sowe,"I really like the app BUT the security is still not up to par.

Swipe right for message count & trash, swipe left to call 3. Make it easier to send to multiple. Annoying to create a new group each time. Otherwise, enjoying the app!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chris Hiles,Great app for privacy and security. The app has some bugs but I will be updating my review as the app improves. Voice notes need improving as they some times tend to cut off when the screen times out. You then need to close the app and go back in and fast forward to where it paused. The voice quality is the best I have experienced on any messaging app. Really enjoying this app and I am trying to convince more people to start using Signal. I rate this as the best messaging app to date.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Martin Alderson,"Great app! I wonder if you could upgrade the ""screen lock"" option to lock the screenshots not only for the user's device but also for the user's contacts' devices so that no one could take screenshots from a chat screen. And I also faced some crashes that the app suddenly stopped working on android devices(it usually happens when I press back in a chat screen, and also on my dad's device, it crashes after entering phone number.), I wish these few issues get fixed ASAP. Best wishes, Martin.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"It's a great app, but i do think you should have one block colour for all chats, unless specifically chosen. Different colours just don't look right for a messaging app. Please sort out - blue would be the obvious choice. Thanks. On top of this, very often notifications don't come through unless you go into the app, which is extremely frustrating. With a bit of refinement, this messaging app will be the best out there.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Miki J.,"I love the fact that the app tells you which of your contacts have joined Signal! Signal! seems noticeably slower than WhatsApp for downloading links that you want to send in messages to your contacts.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rishikesh G Kulkarni,Privacy Privacy is at the core of signal and I really appreciate that. My main problem is that most people in my circle don't use the app so I'm forced to use WhatsApp. The features are good. Would love it if features like chat wallpapers and themes for the app were implemented to give a more customisable experience. Restoring backups isn't as smooth of a experience as with other messaging apps but considering the privacy offered that's a fair trade off.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rick Briggs,"Notifications seem to be an issue. Nobody ever knows I'm trying to get a hold of them. That's bad, but my real issue is transferring my account to another phone. Signal was able to transfer my data and conversations but it does not recognize my phone number! So even though I'm using the same phone number, I have to rejoin everything. So any groups I was an admin on, I can't rejoin since that account is dead and I can't add my self back to that group...... that I'm already in....yet I'm not!",2

One more issue - when I send message it gets delayed a bit. It should be smooth like WhatsApp. By the way, you are doing great job! Love from India.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,A well designed messenger app but I've had problems with messages not sending and not receiving. Especially when replying from the notification bar. I use Android and the couple of other people that I know who use it are on iOS so I'm not sure if that might be the issue. Because of this i don't trust the app to have alerted me to a message or if it's sent without constantly opening the app to check an sometimes having to resend the message because it's showing as not sent.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,W. L.,"Quite improved compared to earlier versions, but still no simple way to safe pictures, media onto a computer drive.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mike Harrison,"Good app, appreciate the privacy. Needs an option to choose to send a standard SMS text to someone who uses Signal.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Z MT,"Overall its actually solid! Far more than I had expected. Can have group chats identical to that of Messanger which is fantastic. This app supports webms which was unexpected but super awesome! The only feature that needs upgrading is how the app reads your image/video gallery, trying to long hold an image then clicking share seems to be an issue currently, although being something so easy to resolve, now with so many new users, that I'm certain will be updated very soon. Once fixed this is 5/5.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Suleiman,"Of course, Signal is great. Its a great alternative to WhatsApp, telegram and all others! I love the emoji pack and the UI & UX is great as well. I have just one request, it would be great if we had a signal id (like in Instagram and telegram), I do not feel much comfortable to share my mobile number to others, having a separate signal id will have a number of other benefits as well and apparently it can give more privacy, after all that is what signal stands for.",5

Shifted from WhatsApp, so I kinda miss the customizable options, like wallpapers, about, group customization etc. Also, UI can really be improved too. Telegram has a much slicker UI.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sean,"Works as advertised generally speaking, my lower rating is purely a condemnation of the lack of features. Most important in my mind, looking to move to Signal from other SMS apps is the inability to port all of your previous conversations in your old app over.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,vipin kulvi,Although the app is good but has many flaws attached to it. For e.g. 1.If you are in a low network area than you won't be able to receive or send messgaes/media smoothly. 2. All the contacts are shown with same color and logos. No profile pics were available. 3. 3G or above network is required to make calls through the app. If you are in an a outskirt area or a rural area just forget it.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,connor,"Used signal for around a year now, it's an incredible app, but I'm rating 4 stars because of the recent UX change. Previously messages were coloured by sender, this gives a nice visual cue for who's been talking in a conversation at a glance. But they seem to have removed this so they can encourage others to move over to Signal. Personally I feel this is quite short sighted and is a detriment to overall usability and style. They seem set on keeping it, which is shame, especially considering the new style could be implemented a lot better. Hopefully they will update the UX in short order, in the meantime 4 stars for great features, but missing a star for a UX that leaves you cold.",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Gael Somerville,Really impressed. This does everything i did on WhatsApp and also has a really useful 'note to self' function. It has a cleaner display and the groups are much easier to see who is messaging due to the idents next to the message. Really reassured by the security messages it throws up and the weekly password check. Also has the desktop app that again is a cleaner display than WhatsApp. I like it a lot.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Reshma Khan,Great app with best of security features. Thanks,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Anne Hartley,"Really safe and secure knowing that it's totally encrypted. Able to make group chats. Only snag is my husband doesn't get notifications unless he opens the app, but as he checks regularly that's not too much of an issue. My favourite point is the total security and encryption and the auto delete after a time period you can choose.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,ciakedeuk,"Just downloaded it, so 1... Will update in future(sorry to many data collectors in worldü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)...",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sophie Coleman,"Very similar to whatsapp but has greater privacy options, and a note to self message function that is useful. The laptop app is also good and does not require your phone to be connected to work so if your phone battery dies you can still continue the conversation (unlike with whatsapp). More colour options for chats and background would improve it.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,LaMeca Simmons,App was very easy to use. Worked well.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Leroy daley,"Came over from WhatsApp, sound quality is far better on signal when you post music on voicenotes which is a good thing, plus you can leave the group yet still listen which is another plus. Calls are a problem and are usually missed for some reason. You have to set one sound for both private and group notifications which is annoying as like myself you may want to know which is which without having to check. Do like the app just need all the issues myself and others have noted taken care of",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tel R,"After the update which you stated as ""required"", I was locked out of my account even after I have entered my phone password correctly over and over again. This never happened in the previous app version. Moreover, your voice call feature triggers the video call as my camera was triggered and I got to see the other party, which shouldn't be the case. This happened numerous times. Last, your voice call records the conversation. In fact, you asked for my permission to it. I mean, what is that for?",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Travis T (TJT1341),Great app and love keeping my conversations between me and the intended recipient!,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shaa Dea,"Simply great. Works like a charm, on mobile as well as on desktop pc",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jaixa.Photo,"Buggy backup makes phone unusable. Backup stops apps running smoothly. There is no way to pause it, stop it or schedule it. Furthermore sending a prerecorded video makes sound unusable and makes videoplay unusable. I think Signal us not meant to be useful. And if privacy is your thing, you get notified when a contact creates a Signal account, no way to turn that off. No way to hide your phonenumber. Privavy is non existant. Only Zuckerberg is not (yet) involved",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ankit Sinha,"Important Recommendations. Interface needs to overhauled, font size, colour and other customisation are much needed. Add more themes, other than light and dark. Add status feature. Specify the limit for group members, file size and add privacy mode similar to instagram. Could be a good alternative if you allow channels feature where people can share and exchange data without worrying about copyright and other factors.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,Good for privacy BUT it doesn't notify you of new messages oftentimes unless you open the app. It's happening quite frequently now. Even sometimes you actually have to send a message then this app will show you your received messages. And No Signal on my phone is not restricted by any battery-saving app in the background. I've checked several times.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chris Jeffries,"Zero issues so far. video call very smooth UPDATE: I changed my phone. However: -- Backup stored the file in a way that my USB/MTP connection could not find it. -- When I eventually got it across to new phone (using Dropbox), only the very first message was recovered. --When I tried to attach the new phone to signal desktop it would not recognise the QR code. This is all reported. Will update in due course.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Awesome app, but you have no control over groups as the admin. You can't delete a person once you added them to a group. This poses a serious security problem should they be arrested or their phone stolen! Also problems with receiving notifications if the app is not open. We checked all phone and app settings. Voice notes stop playing once the screen locks and this is very inconvenient for long messages. I want security and convenience. Once this is fixed I would gladly give 5 stars.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Albert Hernandez,Signal doesn't come on in my front screen when someone is texting to me so I wish you could fix it,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Orgest Plako,"Good experience so far. I need to test it more though. I'd like to request a few things, if possible. 1. Please put a nice background image, that's easy on the eyes. Or let us chose such one. 2. Try to implement the ""last seen"" status and of course let us decide if to activate it. 3. Having some columns at the top for the list of the calls would be great. I'll do my best to bring over friends and family. Also, please bring this app to the Huawei app gallery. üôèüôèüôè",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,BAWS,I love this app. I keep getting a msg on my msgs saying this app will no longer support SMS soon. Is it being discontinued?,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Gigi W,"Maybe this is better on the secuirty front but many of the features still need improvements. Especially on voice messages... I cant tell which messages have be heard and to which point once I have ""read"" them. Together with the fact that it stops playing when u toggle to another screen, it makes playing back voice msgs a mess. Plus, there r glitches in the app...",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,joyan fernandes,"A feature where the service messages will be shown separately in one row and the other messages showing in the rows after would be very much helpful. As of now most of the message space is taken over by service messages. Don't know if it's possible or not or if you fellas want it or not, this suggestion is just from my pocket. As I have observed many messaging apps now, seperating service messages from regular messages.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"This app has a lot of potential however, I would like to make a few suggestions. The app only has the ability to take a photo via the camera icon, if the developer could add the ability to hold the ""take picture"" button down so the app starts recording video like WhatsApp, also the ability to change each users colour (received message background), and wallpaper theme (like in WhatsApp) would be great. Also the ability to double tap sent/received message to like (so a heart appears next to the message) like Instagram does would be awesome.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aditya Roda,"Major UI improvements can be done! Its not aesthetically pleasing. It gives the box type look which is way too old school. Designing plays an important role to ensure users shift to signal without missing their old messaging apps. Other than the UI, I think its great. Ps: please add the wallpaper feature. Everyone loves customizations.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Joey Boyer,"Super simple interface, it let's you know when your chats are secure. It easily moved all messages from the Samsung messages app. So far no issues with it and I hope more people choose signal. What I would like to see from this app is the possibility of it becoming its own messaging platform with messages over data/wifi like iMessage or WhatsApp. This could really streamline communication between android/iPhone.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aniket Tripathi,"Wonderful app, and thanks for listening the request... Thanks, for giving status facility like whatsapp",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Muhammad Syazani Satri,"It would be great if there were more costumization capabilities! I'd like to change my chat background. Also, the UI involving 'tap to type' should be based on the lower part of screen to minimize reaching eg. the GIF/Stickers section is kinda annyoying because I need to move my entire hand to the top of the screen to tap the search bar only to move it down again tu type.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Icabod Orkney,"It's OK. More glitches than WhatsApp. We tried to move a group chat from there to signal, because of WA wanting Facebook to invade privacy. Some people couldn't get signal to work no matter what, and finally dropped out in frustration. Very unfortunate. Some autocorrect suggestions while typing are laughable, and outrageous when you have to send corrections to your note, which it seems to overwrite with gibberish. Hopefully Signal continuously improve and get up to speed. Thanks.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,L√≥an Burger,Messages are delayed recently where I only receive messages 12 to 14 hours later.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jobriath Toon,"It's ok until you make a phone call (in my experience). When making a voice or video call, the recipient's phone doesn't ring (most of the time) but a notification arrives soon after the attempted call to tell the recipient that they've missed a call. Therefore not a very reliable application.... ... now, I'm not always notified (pop-up) when I receive a message. ü§¨",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,lighthousemo at Wildwood,Only signal users are in the list. All other friends are in sms,3

No Last seen feature.No incoming message intimation unless you open the messanger despite turning the notification""ON"". Doesn't show typing. limited stickers. Can't reply message with sticker rather the sticker is being sent separately. Sticker sending shows, photo sent. Takes longer than usual in message sending, and a lot more. Plz fix it, to make it worth of using, else it's more than useless.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Telisa Moore,So far works as advertised. Unable to save notification ringtone. It reverts back to the default.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shahbaz Amin,"It's a good app. However it could now definitely benefit from few updates to make it more user friendly and feature rich. For example, if you have a phone contact's picture added, in Signal you see that instead of their Signal DP. New contacts using Signal only appear after a while, often with a restart.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Collin Haskins,"It really is a nice app. The only problem I have is that though I have set up the notification but it never sounds. Finally, there seems to be a time delay. So if you want to check for messages you have to go into the app, the person you checking on for messages: you have to wait for 2-3 seconds before the message appears, that was sent hrs ago.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Clare G,"Was great for a long time, but increasingly been having issues with delays in messages being sent/received. Today it apparently completely reset itself for some reason and I had to go through the process of setting it up again with all of my contact groups and messages lost. The ONLY reason I'm not ditching it is because I'd have to convince my contacts to make a switch too.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tayre,"Solid messenger, has some issues with the GIF keyboard loading slowly pr not at all, notifications can be missed sometimes and if a call ends through network issues, if another call is received while on that screen it can cause the app to crash (Occurred multiple times). GIF keyboard and notifications can be attributed to the old phone i'm using it on. Apart from the above, it's been really useful, i suggest a double tap shortcut for quick reaction such as thumbs up instead of press and hold.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mark Holland,Works for me. Led to believe its secure and messages can auto delete.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Prasad Chacko,Excellent! Continue this amazing service towards safe and effective online communication,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Theresa Vegan,"Is editing sent messages an obstacle to secure messaging experience? It would be nice to be able to correct typo, changing info etc. Also, one would feel absolutely soothing if an unsaved contact can be deleted, not merely blocked where the unwanted contact still remains on the list standing there in the app setting. To be frank, I had to delete my account and create again just to finish that dumping junk task.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aditya Das,it's a app great tbh... straight up chatting app nothing out of the context. I do prefer signal over some other apps. But there's a few points I'd like to consider while rating this app 1. I can't see if my partner is online cause it gives a nice sense of detail about if my partner is paying attention to the conversation. 2. I've noticed that the delivery of messages are not fast enough which really affect the pace of conversation.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Belinda Ensor,"When talking to people there are to many times the conversation cuts out. Can miss 2 or three words at a time. I may hear 3 or4 words and then a guessing game, then good for a time not easy at all.",2

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Asim Mughal,Notifications are very delayed .. some people say they don't get the call ring on the other end and instead the other user gets a notification of a missed called 30mins to an hour later. I left the app sadly as it's not fast enough in allowing me to talk to my contacts. The other issue is the media being sent is not grouped together .. there is no web app support instead you need to install an app on desktop which also fails to sync messages correctly. The video call quality is extremely bad.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Trevor Patrick Daniel Parnham,Brilliant. Nice to have privacy protected. Going to start contributing. On that note would rather have a one of fee rather than the monthly subscription. Just a personal thought will it will not stop me from paying.,5

Crashes fairly frequently on opening I find, and I notice a delay in messages arriving, but I think that's a combination of the sheer number of people abandoning whatsapp and my aging handset tbh.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,kuldeep sharma,Takes 8-10 minutes to deliver messages. Q: why to use this app?,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tyler Johnson,Unbelievable that they're removing SMS from the app. Guess I'm leaving to use something else now.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Alpha Beta,Dropped this from 5 to 3 Stars because of ongoing issues with messages being SEVERELY delayed and calls not coming through. This has been a problem for several years. Different handsets make no difference. I don't know what it is but it needs to be fixed. I frequently get messages of missed calls even though the phone didn't ring. Texts can take an hour or two to arrive. Unimpressed.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kx Mk,Application won't give notifications unless you open the app again. Have adjusted battery management for the app but it still doesn't seem to do much. Video and call quality is amazing. Much better than WhatsApp in that regard. The interface itself is quite boring and feels like a standard in-built SMS service as opposed to an interactive application.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Geetha Kanapathy,"For once an App that doesn't show your online/offline statuses. You feel free and safe to use it to text. The voice note is loud and clear. Also, doesn't have the unnecessary status update option. And finally, loving the 'Note to Self' feature/option. Very precise and professional app for communication.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Treezy DCM,"It lacks style, customization and flare, but it does a great job at having video calls with minimum effort. It works for me and my family, especially my brother is is not used to most apps. So it is easy to understand, set up and handle. Most of the times quality of the image is OK.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Danish Iqbal,"Below are the issues that I am facing. 1. I won't receive any notification or message being delivered to another person, because the app won't check the servers. Unless someone is opening the app manually, then the message is received to that person. This is really frustrating. 2. Cannot forward or reply to a single photo when someone or me sent multiple photos at the same time. 3. Show the duration of the voice or video call. 4. Video sometimes stopped when doing multi tasking.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Nandini Dubey,"Everytime am glad to see that whatever I demand for this brilliant signal app is fulfilled in its update üòÉ.. I just to wanted to suggest and demand that signal should also show whether the person we are chatting with is online or offline and when was his/her last seen, same like that in whatsapp... otherwise its all perfect ‚ú®Ô∏è..nothing to complain about",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mircea Damian,So far so good. I'm positively impressed and definitely recommend the app. The seemless integration across devices is absolutely beautiful. Need to check how to backup things. Losing chats on a phone change would be undesirable. Update 03/2022: Transferring data on phone change is seamless. The only feature I really miss is live location sharing with friends. Still a 5* app after 2 years of intensive use.,5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sharat Mathew,"Experience has been great. The only suggestion is don't try to be something else, signal in itself is a personal messaging app so keep it to the core simple and efficient should be the primary goal rather that including features that actually slow down the messaging experience. I believe in open source development, and that's the major reason I still use Signal. Keeping it a 4 star üåü because there's room for improvement, not in feature set but performance wise. üòä",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Robert,Wrote a review. Posted. Disappeared. SMS only worked through WiFi so not a good start. Wouldn't recognize partner as using the app. Showed non secure and messages would hang. Reinstalled. Troubleshooted. Didn't work. When I installed it deleted all messages between me and my partner in our standard messaging app. Thanks!,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kid Ding,"4 stars changed 5 now. I hadn't been using it that long at the first review. Nice, simple and uncluttered UI. Good amount of customisable settings once you've learnt the lay out. Signal does a very handy trick when contacts don't come over from the main app in this field. Allows you to use it as the main SMS sender. All texts in one place, not for everyone. Helped me. Would still like some way of sending MSM, (see my support email suggestion). Sorry for the accidental amount sent.",5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,nochannel2013,"Like many have said, the arbitrary decision to remove support for mms/sms forced me to move to a different app, after using Signal from the very beginning. It was difficult to do, and moving 7GB of messages proved to be a major challenge. Wish the devs would reverse course and provide support for older technologies or, adopt RCS.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mike Donnelly,"Terrible overall experience. I stuck with this app for over a year after WhatsApp. Nothing but issues with calls, missed messages, bugs, the list goes on. I kept it until the recent decision to restrict SMS--deal breaker. Gone. GB for now.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ricky Swanson,"Edit: Will change score to 5 star if sms support stays. ----------- We need SMS support to stay. I understand Signal only presents a shell for unsecured SMS messages, but the APP itself is more secure and feature rich than the stock apps. The screenshot prevention alone makes Signal a worthy SMS handler. Getting people to convert to Signal is easier when they are able to consolidate their security conscious contacts with those who aren't under one app.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,James Rourke,"Why can't I see any of my messages and contact from the Google app that took over my new phone? Doesn't Signal copy that info? For some reason, only one contact shows from all my contacts. I've looked at the ""help"" but can't find this answer. I also wrote a short description but there was no ""send"" button.",2

Farewell Signal. I hope you become cool again.",1

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Cko Mtnz,I like that signal doesnt show when I'm online. In terms of daily use some improvements could be made eg option to automatically save media to library from selected contacts & a way to play audios with external player without opening (like WhatsApp audio files can be played using an opus player w/out being opened or showing as heard). Glitches: 1 App shows contacts even after deleted/ can't share photos from album 2 app crashes & have to select in Signal to send 3 contact pics slow/don't update.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Technically good, BUT  - it only encrypts if both sender and receiver are using signal as their primary SMS app  - security breach by notifying people on your contact list that you're on signal  - can't schedule messages to send at a later time.

It's an amazing SMS replacement and the invite to Signal is probably my favorite feature allowing your friends to easily gain access to everything all the other messengers can do.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Javed Alam,Great app that enhances confidentiality for all people. Especially useful in healthcare settings to protect patient confidentiality; has been adopted in Victoria as WhatsApp is currently less secure - it has cloud backups which makes it vulnerable to third party inspection if requested by the government.,5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Wihan Fourie,"Nice app and all but please add a faster way to delete a message. Swipe to delete should be standard, long pressing to delete messages or having to select many then press another menu button to delete is cumbersome and against design principles.",3

Message on the first, something else on the second and my call logs on the third. If signal needs new accounts, it must add a status row that allows people to know what's popping. They can call it the ""feed"". I also need the team to change the default message template. Has to blend prob signal logo with faint blue top down not a blank screen.",4

Not to mention the End-to-end encrypted message from the client, which makes the app truely E2EE. It's not those app that claims to have the encrypted messages on their server. The downside is that it needs a phone number to create ID and the fact that its desktop client right now doesn't have voice calling or video call, but the devs promise to add it in the future.",4

Quick suggestions: Because a lot of people are moving from WhatsApp to this app, they're already used to some features.

Now everyone else's text is grey, and your text colour changes depending on who you're talking to.

It makes it so much harder to quickly parse group chats, and there's no way to sync up specific people's colours across chats. Was perfect, please change it back!!",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,I like the app. I wish the video of self could be moved around when making a video call. I like that it operates when WhatsApp doesn't.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sajjad Kabir Joy,"Highly recommended to everyone. Old timer here, been using it for ~2 years now, before the so-called ""let's shift from WhatsApp"" boom. Signal gets done what it should: send and receive messages and calls in a way that ensures privacy and security. It still has fun features like message-reacts and stickers. What more can I ask for? This is a non-profit community project, and I'd love it even if it was lagging in performance, which it doesn't. I hope it always stays free (as in freedom).",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,K- Fed,I haven't really had a chance to use it much but they want me to rate it anyway. I'd hate to over do it so 1 star it is. Also it's hard to send a screenshot.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Elizabeth Shaw,"The Signal Privacy Messaging Application is simple to comprehend and install. They offer a wide variety of options available in my current messaging app. The only one I miss is the ""scheduling""feature for messages, where I can wtite a msg at 3a.m but schedule it to be sent at 9a.m., for instance. Considering that this is a Non-Profit, Volunteer staffed outfit, I suggest that everyone consider a donation. Totally worth supporting. Consider the privacy and security with end-to-end encryption.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Elizabeth A,"Excellent app. Allows me to download only the images and videos I want to keep. Allows local backup and restore. Desktop app is separate from the mobile app but shares all messages. Every member of a group has a different colour, though the colours could be a little less garish.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,G Godfrey,"Would love to recommend this app but a few things would need to change. 1) If I choose Signal as my SMS app I wouldn't necessarily want to stop messages arriving in the default app (I back them up through that.) 2) I never want to use MMS messages, there should be an option to switch them off. 3) There is no pinch to zoom; I don't always have my glasses with me! 4) As a David versus a Goliath you should be looking to your customer base for differentiation, add a feedback option & a vote system.",3

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jeannette Monserratte,"So far I enjoy using Signal, easy and straightforward!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jim Hayes,I like this app a lot. I wish group admins could actually be in control of discussions (having the ability to delete comments instead of waiting for the person to do so would be helpful in managing a group).,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mahmoud Taher,Nice secure platform .. some improvements are needed though .. It doesn't appear as a communication service when I check my contacts no. like whatsapp or duo for example .. Sometimes it doesn't notify when one of contacts start using the service .. Service is unstable recently !! replays delay and come in groups !! and it keep telling that there is problems !,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Laurie Chiddle,"Overall I really like Signal. The biggest sell will always be it is what WhatsApp should be. From a user perspective it is very close to perfect. The only downside, and it is significant for me, is a delay is receiving messages when the app is not running in the foreground. The only reason I continue to use Signal is because I support the project.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chris Cookson,"Does what it says with privacy. The down side of privacy first means that sometimes features in other instant messaging apps aren't present or work a bit differently. The developer seems responsive and tries to implement as many features as possible, but the no compromise on privacy policy does mean this app will never be the market leader in bells and whistles. Understand that, and you've got a really robust messaging app",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ahmad Al-Husamiyah,"Nice, simple, more features, just need to reorganize the buttons places, as replace ""+"" button with record voice button, to make it faster since people do record audio messages more than attaching files.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Showvik Ghosh,"App is good. Call quality and clarity is excellent, more clearer than WhatsApp. But the major issue I'm facing that, thought I enabled lock screen notification, it's not showing any notification, no phone call notification either.

When making a call, the confirmation button is not required and troublesome, especially if you use the phone with only one hand.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kushagra Jain,Overall good application but there are few problems that need to be fixed for betterment. For eg - 1. In screen security to block screenshots in app and chat. If enabled it stops us from taking screenshots and not others. 2. It will be really helpful if we get a notification if some takes the screenshot of 1 time visible media sent. Thanks!,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ivan,"Really happy that the user base is growing. I've brought a few people myself and supported your cause by donating. Some minor visual improvements would be good (too many different colors in group chats, please tone down the high contrast) otherwise all is decent! Keep up the good work!

Thank you for keeping our conversations private!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Amon,Overall a nice messaging service for Android but also usable cross platform. Unfortunately there seems to be a bug where the qr code scanner from the signal app won't recognize the qr code (at least on Android).

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Robert Knight,"Was absolutely a great messaging app until they dropped SMS support. I have converted a few people to the app because it worked so well but nowhere near enough to justify using it after SMS was stripped away.

Voice call quality is bit down . But sending the messages is not as smooth as whatsapp You need good internet speed in Signal , for quick messaging as per my experience. notification problem is also issue in some devices. They need to work on this . They should also work on user interface like chat background , colour , emojis . All the Best",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,SweetCakeLover,"I find this app perfect. I don't need to see when who was last online and i don't need a status function, in my opinion it's more superficial unnecessary clutter. However, it may be useful for others but I don't need it. The app is great as it is. EDIT: I really dislike the ""delete for me"" button. When you want to press delete for everyone instead and you can't retrieve the mistaken delete for me message. It's really bad.",3

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Bello Jizana,"It's good but the system needs to work consistently. It would be more desirable if you could see when last the other users were online, cse sometimes that's how we monitor our loved ones.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,The Shorts,A tidy little App that I can use to run SMS as well as private messages. Painless to switch from WhatsApp and still handles video and voice calls very well. I would like to be able to tell who else is using signal and if a message I'm about to send will be sent as a Text or IM particularly as MMS has charges on my vendor (perhaps it does this but I'm not sure). SMS management is off by default so isnt an issue unless you enable it.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ignacio Gaston Viana Courtial,"Has some issues with contacts. Signal gets picky with how contact numbers are stored and might not recognize all contacts, but this appears to have been solved since the last updated.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Bill,"I really didn't want to, but I had to uninstall the app after years of tolerating the issues. Constant failed MMS receiving and delivery were the deal breakers.

I don't need to chat with all people on my phone book. And the way it shows it right on my home page is just irritating. Moreover, I think there is no way one could shoot & share video in Signal. Plz also add the feature to zoom with thumb (not only pinch zoom) while taking photo. Photo could be improved as well.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Vitope Achumi,"Overall a simple and a clean app. The interface is clean, privacy features are top notch. However, slight improvements can be made. And, yes, addition of status. I'm so used to that feature in whatsapp. So far I've convinced 2 of em' to use Signal by saying that I won't be replying to any of them in whatsapp, and if that matters even by a bit please consider adding the status feature. One more thing, don't limit our status length to 30sec üòî... At least 1min length will be much appreciated.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Piotr Siarek,"The app is really good BUT ... 1. Could we have more options to adjust chat view please? 2. Spaces between lines between participants are far too big. 3.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Don Pardoe,"Used to be good, but the enforced PIN feature is a totally unwanted move. It says it can be disabled, but gives no indication how to do that. I used to recommend Signal to others, but can no longer do so. Developers appear to have very poor judgement by foisting this on users without warning. Personally, I initially saw this as a very suspicious hacking attempt, when the ""create a PIN"" screen started popping up.

I want to read everything my friends send me, and if we want to talk at length, then hiding part of the message makes it very tedious to refer to it in your reply.

I don't want everyone seeing when i'm online, when i was last seen, etc. Thanks and keep it up the good work!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,T Rolls,So far I'd be so happy to say that singles private messenger is the way to go I can't reveal who I talk to by my choice but it's very private and I think that you'll be happy with also of course you know me if something goes fails goes wrong or it ain't why I said it was on the first one to step up the plate and back and I'll knock it out of the ballpark and delete it if it don't keep this word with me and I will keep my world with you so far so good so go a head and install it welcome to signal,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,alfa omega,"This app is getting better, I hope it won't get too big and too cluttered as most app as they grow. It makes them less desirable. Is it possible at this point in development to split the system into two. One is a minimalist as a base and second just as the developers want the app grow. That way in the future if I just want to communicate I get the minimum, but still will be able to communicate with the advanced.

I do not use the status thing, I do not change colors or wallpaper so I do not need that and at the end of the day people only use it maybe once or twice so I think that it is not really necessary. What would really be cool its if you could deny the acces to the other person to screenshort or record the chat ans when you delet the chat it also deletes the chatnof the other one, it would be really cool (a feature telegram has and the only think I like there).",5

The only thing I would like is for the desktop app to support easier selection and deletion of a subset of messages rather than just individually or by deleting entire conversations.

Delivery happens eventually, but seeing as this issue is seen on multiple networks (home wifi, 4G, work wifi, friend's wifi) I doubt it's a network problem.

I love the focused and patient approach of the entire Signal team. Congratulations! to you all for the marvelous effort.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Fayis Ismail,This is a great app for messaging. It does have nice features and also better at privacy. But sometimes there are crashing issues and also I'm not able to open signal while switching recent apps. Overall it's a great app and I believe the developers will improve the app in the future updates.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Peter Staples,"Generally worked okay, but after offering the ""Enable Signal for SMS"" action by placing this banner over the conversation text box the banner remains permanently in place and blocks the text box. All I did was tap the banner, select the default messaging app instead of signal and ""do not show again"". Updates makes no difference. Conversations are now read only.

I have mailed the issues to the devs. Two weeks later, no response. And now the app asks me to write a review? Ballzy move, if I may say so. When it works, it's spotless, when it doesn't, it's finished. (so far)",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Silke Kind,"Okay as far as you only write short messages. Longer messages often get stuck and need to be resent. Same problem with sending photos: Just one mostly loads okay, but try to send even two or let alone a bunch at a time and they ALWAYS get stuck and I need to resend! This problem is even more annoying with videos: if they're just a few seconds long you're sometimes lucky and they do load. But any video longer than 30 seconds, and they will get stuck for sure, + need to be resend more than once!",2

The drawbacks for me are that it doesn't run as well in the background as other messaging apps.

To load up also takes a very long time. In overall is a very slow app, I do recommend it in case you want privacy between your friends and yourself. But tbh, my biggest tip for the app development team is to improve the speed and stability of the app.. Edit - I recommend having an option to hide our phone number so random people of a group won't be able to see it.",2

I have tried it via Linux on Chromebook but it causes huge system lags. I've reduced a star as the Signal Android app should work on Chromebooks or have web / Chromebook extension access. Original review: Google's Messages app wouldn't activate ""Chat"" which annoyed me. Having looked for an alternative I saw Signal had the functions I wanted (file transfer, in line pictures, voice dictation, emoji etc) also the messages are encrypted. The reason I chose Signal over Telegram or Facebook's messenger is that signal is open source and auditable and advert free. WhatsApp & FB messenger have privacy issues and WhatsApp is soon to have adverts inserted. Also Signal's app runs smoothly on my phone.",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,addi hejran,"Unlike with WhatsApp, the desktop version of this app can be used without we having to run the mobile version also. This makes for convenience. What I don‚Äôt like about the desktop version of this app are 1) sometimes, messages sent using it are not reflected on my phone; 2) in the event some of those messages are reflected on my phone, they are not presented in chronological order. For example, a message sent at, say, 10 a.m. is shown on my phone as well as on my contact‚Äôs phone after the messages I have sent later at, say, 12 noon, 1.00 p.m., and 2.00 p.m. on the same day. On this score, Telegram functions better. REVISED REVIEW TODAY 12 Oct 2020 The problems mentioned in my first review are no more. Signal is now my messaging app of choice, and those closest to me have all migrated to it..",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Stephane,"From a privacy standpoint, it is hard to beat Signal but that does not mean that the UX has to be so raw. It would be nice to have an integrated stickers library, to have fluid animations (stickers are currently shockingly slow, laggy), to be able to customise the theme and lookn'feel of the app, to have emojis preselected when typing in colons+emoji etc. These things might sound petty if not childish but they contribute to making an IM fun to use on a daily basis for families and hackers alike",3

The five stars is for everything that has improved and I'm really content.

I've tried granting all the requested permission, not optimizing battery use but still same problem. Some sms are not received. Such thing don't happen to apps like Facebook Messenger, Android messages or Truecaller...these apps don't miss SMSs once set as defaults. Do something.",4

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Bhargav Dutta,Please please please release an update and fix these issues. 1) the notification sound doesn't change and it's doesn't make sound either. I tried all the troubleshooting given by the website. 2) update the emojis or just allow us to use gboard stuff don't convert them to yours. 3) Improve the video/audio call quality as it's lagging. Fixing these will make it perfect simple messenger app. After that you guys can add new features if you want.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,ADARSH Tiwari,"Here's the detailed review- Apps functionality is too good, everything works like it should but the app feels less polished than it's counterparts. Even text signal messages take around one to three seconds to send, images get compressed and take about 5 seconds atleast to reach. SMS features needs to be improved and added, bubble messages would be appreciated. There should be options for sending full size photos and videos.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Janni,"I'll give it only 3 stars because there are mandatory things missing that we need in order to communicate, and to use the app in a more pleasant way: 1. No way to choose your own wallpaper (only light/dark version and some color options for chats which you also need to change for each chat individually) 2. No way to show yourself as online or see if other people are online (it could be an optional option to tick; like ""seen messages"") 3. No way to star (like in WhatsApp) or in any way to save/favorite messages 4. No way for the app to download media for your phone automatically (I can see this to be a problem with disappearing messages but it could be an option for only those you choose to be in the chat forever) 5. If you listen to a recording, it doesn't stop when you start to record yours automatically. You need to manually stop the recording first before starting yours so that they don't overlap (it would also be nice if the app didn't automatically start playing your OWN recordings after listening to some other peeps recordings. This is an annoying problem/feature in WhatsApp as well.) 6. You don't see the length of voice messages in your notification bar. You have to open the chat first so it downloads them, which sucks because you don't know if there's is a 5 second or a 10 minute voice message. And then you lose the notification(s) + it shows that you've seen the other person's messages even though you might not answer them at that moment. Yes, you can always tick the option off for ""seen messages"", but I'd like to keep it on since there is no other way to know if someone is chatting with you in real time/being online while reading your messages.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Samuel Lane,"Great app, one concern. When you sign up it alerts your contacts that you're on signal. This distresses me, it should be optional. To be clear, not only should the reception of notifications be optional (which it is) but the sending of the notification. Other than the issue I take with this app, I can't fault it.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,erich ravell,"For some reason messages sent with Signal deleyed 1, 2 or even 7 hours. For time to time incoming Signal messages does not nodify itself. There is a problem somewhere. Do Android smartphones block Signal messages? Or is something going on in the data transfer between the Signal servers? Our family is using new smartphones like samsung and oneplus (EU location). In short, Signal does not work as needed. We are very disappointed with the use of Signal. Too bad.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Notetoheather,"While listening to messages sent to me it often goes silent. The app shows it is still playing (but it's not), and the pause/play button won't work during these times. I have to back out of the app entirely and go back in to restart the message. It will happen many times in a row and then other days not at all.",3

Important/urgent texts have been eaten or come up as errors, putting a strain on personal relations. My partner often receives no notification of a new msg, again, putting a strain on personal relations. I've sent more than enough bug reports w/no response from devs. Seriously considering getting rid of this disappointment. (Also thx for deleting my initial review. /s)",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sagar Hemmige,Maybe not as polished as other data thieving alternatives but easily gets the job done. Dosen't have useless features such as 'status' to get you into over indulgence. Overall a good messaging app with rare hiccups. I am sure they will be ironed over time if user base increase and contributions pour in. Edit: The new color schemes are good. Looks better polished overall.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Ivan Hernandez,In multiple instances the other person can't hear me and I have to hang up and call again. Additionally at the beginning of the calls there is a delay with my voice and I can hear my own voice. This does not happen with other apps under the same circumstances (i.e. not s connection issue),3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,P. Ac.,By far the best messaging app available.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Liliana Cahill,"Generally a really nice and add-free messaging app that saves your conversations from being googled. My biggest gripe with it is just the way it handles swapping to sending an SMS to someone, as it's liable to sneakily switch to sending a signal message instead if you blink. I'd love clearer and more permanent swapping because I've missed some messages/waited on a reply because of not having data",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Benjamin Clifton,Was a great app over the years. No it's pointless. So long,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Arnold Christopher,The only reason I give it a three star and not five is only because the read receipts and the notifications are way slow and are not true sometimes. The other person will be in the chat but I get a delay of a good 5 seconds for the read receipts. And also there are times I only get a single tick for a really long time and I have to go to WhatsApp to talk to the same person. Which doesn't fill the purpose of using it.,3

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,JoLissa Lieberowitz,"Very happy so far! Even the video calling aspect is surprisingly good and has a crisp picture. Only downside is messages sometimes don't go through instantly, even with decent connection and notification settings changed, and my spouse doesn't rec'v my msgs until he goes into the app itself. I personally do not have that issue most of the time. Very happy that I switched from WhatsApp to Signal.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,jessie woletz,"Love it! Feels safe! With so many options. I have an Android -and it may seem little - but i love that I can finally leave emoji responses for friends' texts, and receive them. And the audio message option is awesome. I love that I don't have to hold the button down to leave them, like I do in other apps. Super grateful.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"I really like the idea of an encrypted chat app that can also fall back on SMS/MMS. A few missing features are keeping me from switching, however: no ability to rename MMS groups, no ability to pin conversations to the top of the list, and no Chromebook compatible version so I can message from my laptop.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aditya Aravind,"Signal is good chatting application, with great privacy policies and protection in platform! However it does lack some features like status, which may be a concern for some people! The reason I only gave 4 stars is because it needs further development in some areas, especially in calling! My biggest problem was that I didn't get any notification when I am getting a call if I am outside the application! This definitely needs fixing because we can't be on the app for 24/7, as this chews up memory",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Best messaging service on the market. I love how it handles SMS and Signal's MMS together in the same app, so it just replaces your default texting app. That's what pushed me over the edge and got me using it on a daily basis. As a person who likes UI customization, I like the swapable chat colors and dark mode but would love to see an OLED black mode in the future.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Weldon Adair,"Works well. Signal responds well to a huge increase in users. As a senior computer consultant I was pleased with how they handled an unprecedented sudden increase in new users. I'm confident that they can make improvements in the system as time goes forward. As it is, it meets most of my expectations. One issue I have is that it is too easy to accidentally archive a conversation. A user confirmation is needed.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mihai Chirculete,"Overall good experience but lacks sticker replies with which a lot of people are accustomed to from other apps.

You can't actually switch SIMs when sending messages and there's no manual option to choose what SIM card you want o send from. It's so inconvenient. Once this fixed,. I'll change it to 5 stars because it's really a great messaging app!",3

Oh wait, Google doesn't like encryption and consumer privacy, since it interferes in their ability to crawl every letter of someone's data.

One enhancement that would be nice: better UI experience when responding to a particular message inside a thread.",5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Qamar Hussain,Hi! 1. Please make more accessible your app with screen reader users. 2. Add the option to add story status like WhatsApp. And please make sure that your app will compatible with MI devices. I can't change the ringtone.

The emojis are not readable by screen readers. So you must focus on accessibility. Thank you!,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andrea Fanti,"The app by itself is good and it works well The single issue I have with Signal is that when you want to also use a computer with it the old messages are not transferred. There should be way to do it, i agree that for security it cannot be performed automatically but just preventing the user to do it is not acceptable",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Dewang Ruke,The app sometimes has connectivity issues and doesn't send a message at all for days. Also notifications are weird... When I'm in the app it gives me notifications. When I minimise it doesn't ring the notification sound just gives push notification on the top bar. Want to continue using this but the issues need to go.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tremendous Eraze,The app is really really cool and I love that it's new and all but it needs a few more touches. For me the UI of an app is very important. It has this kit kat look to it... just bare and it's just there. It is very well done so far but there's a whole lot more work to be done and it has to be done quickly in order to catch the moving train. 4 stars for now,4

It either distracts by having a constantly moving object on the screen or in the case of the caller's smaller window actually covers their chin, mouth and sometimes nose. This is poor design and redundent. Please remove this new 'feature' or provide a way to turn it off. Such tinkering distracts rather than adds to another wise super app!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Signal is great! Love their commitment to our privacy. Having some trouble with using for phone calls. Lots of background noise as well as voices(!), echoing on my end while person on other end of call hears nothing; drives me crazy. Also many dropped calls requiring many call backs back & forth; very frustrating. Also wish there was a Signal Folder that photos & vids are directly saved to & not just on phone. Phone, where? You have to hunt for them. But aside from all that, Signal is the best!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kelvin Odinson,App keeps crashing on Samsung Note 9. Can't even keep it open for 5 seconds.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Works really well, even long voice conversations halfway around the world are crystal clear and stable! Messaging works as expected. Love how secure it is, and each update seems to make it better. Have been recommending it to everyone. Thanks for making a great product!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Karen Barker,I talk with my daughter in France on this app and it always works well!! Thank you for helping me keep in touch with my loved ones!,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Travis Birgy,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to a recent bug I've been experiencing. When I'm in a group chat and also have a separate chat with someone who's also in the group chat, I receive double notifications. For example, if friend A sends a message in the group chat, I receive a notification for the group chat and then another notification for the separate chat with friend A. It's a really annoying problem and I hope it's fixed in the next update.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Diane Hulbert,"Very dependable, only drawback I wish would work is assigning a specific notification sound or ring to a contact. I have sent many requests to support for help with this, never get anything but a canned response. Sometimes real communication is what's needed, a phone number would be great with a real person on the other end.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Alfred Hong,"hello I have a suggestion please implement it or its not as good as WhatsApp. it is........ add custom backgrounds, and that's all! backgrounds that you can customize as white is boring. thanks. :) and also the profile picture of others is what you have saved on your phone, please can all people see same profile pic, or if somebody doesn't like other people's profile pic, have the ability to change theirs, only you can see,. thanks that's all",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sanjaya Gebrial,"App is fine, messaging works as intended. Only (big) problem is you can't use it on multiple phones, even though you can use it on phone + desktop. Need to get that feature added. Also have to use a phone number to sign up. Doesn't make sense for a privacy focused messaging app.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Alex Polyakov,"Verify pin. Why? Periodically apps asks to verify pin. I forgot it, and create new. Whats the point? I have to remember pin which is not required. Nice joke to force all users do stupid actions.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Richard Burke,"Smooth, no ads, unique and useful features, easy to use.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Darren Chu,"Signal has been incredibly buggy on my Android Samsung S9+. Almost every time I want to open a message, Signal hangs, not responding. I often click on a message line 4 to 5x before Signal opens the message. Often once the message can be read, another 3-4 attempts have to be made to actually send the message or attach a file. Signal worked ok when I first installed it in 2020 around June but it has been frustrating using Signal since late last year, presumably due to upgraded versions.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Just like Whatsapp but safer and with Dark Mode but without these features: - Deleted messages only are deleted from your side. - The link preview for YouTube doesn't work properly as of 02/2020, after months of users complaining about it. For me it worked only one time- When you have an open chat and you go to another app and then return to the app, it always comes back to the list of Signal contacts window, not to the active chat window",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Luke Ott,"Whenever I first start to play a received audio, my Bluetooth disconnects/reconnects (regardless of it being a headset, car, speakers, etc). This gets annoying very fast because it happens several times a day. This doesnt happen for other apps; pretty sure a recent Signal update broke something. E.g.: Connect Headset > Play music > audiomsg arrives > hit ""play"" > BT disconnects > audio plays over phone/Bluetooth reconnects. Afterwards the problem doesn't occur again until new BT connection.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Diane Ryskiewicz,Just learning about the versatile applications and will work on learning more. I am hopeful that the plusses outweigh the minusses and keeps my info secure. I am seldom on other programs on the phone or computer. I don't think folks realize what a great deal signal is.,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Gregor Voss,"Well meant effort, privacy, encryption and all. However useless in a professional environment. Ringtone erratic, sometimes at both ends almost inaudible, although volume turned up 100%. Call quality mediocre at best. Didn't bother to try SMS, enough time wasted. Compared to other calling app with end to end encryption, same router settings: difference like day and night. Uninstalled.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Unlike Skype and Hangouts, you can't run it on multiple mobile devices simultaneously and have them stay in sync. The desktop app is nice but requires a resync every time you switch from one mobile device to the next. Call quality is decent. Love the privacy.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Maryam Zahra,"It's a nice app for chatting and calling with privacy... But there are some issues with it like message doesn't get delivered or isn't received on time... Video call or voice call often is shown as missed call without ringing although phone is not on silent , notifications are on and app is also updated... It consumes a huge amount of battery and phone also heats up while using it for calls... I hope these issues will be addressed soon!",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Prince Darkness,Very good app and private +free cloud memory,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,hamdoushku,The worst thing is I can not install it on my pc win 10 - 32bit it seems it needs 64 bit! This is odd in comparison to all other media Apps.You need to make changeable back grounds.I can not use this app now because my pc is 32 bit and I use it a lot to send photos or videos to my friends as it is easier than the phone!!!,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,Totally replaced my stock Messages app. Integrates nicely with Blackberry Hub. Consistent updates pushed out. Dark theme. Secure end-to-end encryption with other Signal users. Group chats work well. The only option I'd like to see added is 'Force Wi-Fi' or 'Prefer WiFi' over network. Nothing to complain about but theres always room for improvement,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Security focused, decent features, good UI. The delete only deletes things client side which is useless, it needs a delete for everyone. Has a huge delay sometimes like other messenger apps. Sometimes it won't recieve notifications until I open the app (I enabled everything for data in the settings). Main thing is messages need to be sent instantly. And a way to prevent contacts from being notified that I use signal if they do too. hopefully they add delete for everyone and hide from contacts",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Victoria Arikawe,"Wonderful, the line is clear, the voice of the receipt is clear",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tushar Srivastava,Good experience in all. A couple of issues in Android phones that iPhones don't suffer from. You can't forward a message to more than one person at one go. Also you can't transfer multiple files to same person at one go. Fix this and signal rocks,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,skull munki,I love this app! I use it as my default message center for texting. I only gave it 2 stars because since I have swapped to Signal I keep getting weird random group text messages so much so that I've completely filled up my phones capacity to block random numbers and now get them from weird email addresses as well. I will most likely be uninstalling it until they can fix it so I don't get a bunch of weird texts.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Anthony Iaboni,"Great app with a good feature set. Works quickly, not bloated, and secure. It's also nice that I can incorporate my SMS messages into one place. One feature I didn't see was the capability to forward a message to someone else. Maybe I haven't found it yet.",5

com.p1.chompsms,David Karr,"I've been using chomp on my Galaxy note 9 for quite a while. I have custom sound notifications set at the top level, and for several specific numbers. As of a couple of weeks ago, the sounds stopped working. Curiously, the same thing happened with Whatsapp at the same time. However, the Samsung messages app works fine. In both the chomp and whatsapp settings, I can verify what sound I have configured and hear it, but when a message arrives, it only vibrates. I have tried rebooting.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jill Cowan,"I have been using this app for years, like since the beginning and have loved it and never wanted anything else. When the Android 13 update rolled out, it really messed up this app. My phone no longer lights up when I get a text, which is a real problem. I depend on that setting. This app needs a serious update to catch up to Android 13! Please fix ASAP!!! My phone is lagging and half the time the app freezes and I can't even open it!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Stephanie J,"I absolutely love this app. Very easy to use and does so much more then the basic sms app on my phone. I love the delayed send option, it's great for reminders to friends. I have to say I used the free version for about 2 hours and then purchased the paid version. Not because of ads or anything like that, instead, I wanted to support a great product and this is a great product Edit 11/28/22 I've been using chomp for two years now and I still love it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Mike R,"The option to change the notification sound needs to be more easily accessible. It's pretty tucked away and kind of hard to find. The same with changing the fonts. The app scans for fonts and shows you what applications there are, but to actually change it means you got to go into the conversation view scroll down to outgoing messages and then see the fonts there. If the option to scan for font is easily to find, then the option to change them should just be included right there.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Virginia Mayberry,"I've been using Chomp for several years and I love it. However, I'm starting to get mass spam texts that have multiple other phone numbers attached to it, and there is no option to add the original sender to the block list. If you were able to add the block list to the menu, after long pressing the contact info from the chat bubble, it would be super!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Kayla W.,"An amazing SMS app. The options to customize the aesthetic elements are simple yet thorough, and the ads are completely non-invasive. Literally my only gripe is that the message notifications take up half the screen, but it's an incredibly small price to pay. Speaking of small prices, the one time payment for ad-free experience + extra themes is literally $5 plus tax. Totally affordable if you ever have any extra spending money, and yet not necessary to improve your experience! I love this app!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Derik Arendall,"Only issue I've really encountered that I can think of is sometimes the text notification block doesn't go away after opening it, and will need swiping away in the phones notifications list before it really goes away. Aside from that, it's a great app with a great breadth of customization options perfect for anyone that wants to play with different aesthetics to their texting UI",4
com.p1.chompsms,R honda D,"I love the features but for some reason or another my messages are not being sent or received at times. Then all of a sudden I get them all at once. This just started happening about 2 weeks ago. Any suggestions. Other than this hiccup, this app is amazing! Update: per chomp, this is as a Samsung update issue. Reset network settings under general management.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Melissa Gurney,Been using about a year and it was easy to set up and pretty intuitive except for being able to voice text haven't been able to figure out. Another bummer is you can't send videos. I've tried sending 3 second videos get an error message doesn't support. Other than that great app!,5
com.p1.chompsms,KENNETH MCGHEE,"I have used chomp on a daily basis for the last 5 years and I find it to be much more feature rich than the messenger apps preinstalled on my Samsung and iphone. Besides Chomp having more customization, the ability to schedule text for delivery the followng day is a game changer for me (are you listening Apple). Also I love how easy it is to backup & restore previous messages.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jayden W.,"A finicky experience. #1 there isn't even an app-wide dark mode. #2 I have to manually select delete multiple in the 3 dots menu, very inconvenient and slow. #3 very slow... Overall not looking too great. Either the developers have odd preferences or not enough effort is being put into the design.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Brandi Darlas,"I usually use textra, but currently it's having some issues. Wrote a review on it. Switched to chomp for now. Issues found: #1 unread dot isn't staying the color you set it. Reverts back to it's original color before you can save. #2 When in settings it still has the original white/green background, it doesn't take on the theme that is set. Not sure if it's a Glitch, but the white is hard on the eyes. Dark mode is best. Even a light gray would be better. Please consider fixing... Thank you.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Rob S,"It would really help if you LOST THE ADS. No one wants to see a fake message from Ashley furniture pop up on the message list. I sincerely doubt anyone is actually clicking the link anyway. I also don't like the group text or picture message functions. In group text, there is no way to send individual messages; they either go to everyone at once or not at all. Also whenever you get a picture message, the app doesn't work. You don't get a pop-up notice, it's like the app doesn't know what to do.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Natural Nashuan,Excellent. The ads aren't intrusive and actually interesting. It's better than the Google texting app that came with the lhone because it allows single texts to be deleted without deleting the entire conversation. Easy to use for sending photos though writing space is limited. I haven't had any trouble with it at all. Three years later I'm still pleased in 2022,5
com.p1.chompsms,Ian Icecaster,"It freezes up every so often and asks if ya wanna close it or wait. I like the app, and it's by far above and beyond the other apps, but still it has issues. I typed a LONG MESSAGE to my girl, and it refused to send it in an SMS or MMS version, so I had to take a screen shot of every paragraph and sent the images to her, for her to read the entire text. I'm shopping for a new app, but using this one because I paid for it and when I find something better than this, I'll dump this and move on.",2
com.p1.chompsms,LADY. S,"I've been using Chomps for over 10 years I've never had any issues, but for some reason, I've been having some major software problems with this app. I can't delete none of my messages through the app. I uninstalled it then deleted the message on my original app then I reinstalled chomps the messages were still there! I really like this app because of the ""signature feature"" but I think I'm a have to look for another messaging app until chomps fix the issue.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Allendefullism kin s s hi,"It works fine. The default samsung texting app requires you to press ""view more"" on longer texts, which I was not having, and while using google's texting app I repeatedly had texts sent to me that I never received. I have had one pretty major problem with Chomp. This review only allows 500 characters, so to cut it short: i was not getting popup notifications from chomp for over a year, eventually I discovered I had to go into my phone's settings and like 10 screensinfoundtheoptiontoenablethem",5
com.p1.chompsms,Layne Erdman,"So chomp wanted me to update my review, I've been using it a few years because tmobiles text app was terrible. Chomp is a good basic app. Kind of no frills, no fun stuff like Verizon gives you regularly with emojis etc. But stable and reliable, what I miss most from other platforms is search capability. you can't search a particular conversation or search just photos. it's very limited but it does the job.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Private Party,I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because: 1. The font size is small and you can't change it; 2. I couldn't find the Block Sender option But I did finally find the feature to lock a message or image - it comes on after you select the image or text and another menu appears with things not listed immediately under its Settings.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Jackie Kidwell,"I needed to find an app due to my msg app on my phone no longer made group text possible. Responses came back not within the group. CHOMP was the second download I tried. Works flawlessly. Not only for groups. After about a week very small adds appear at the top, but they are not intrusive. One thing I do wish the app would do is to be able to sort contacts into categories such as favorites, business, clients, etc. For now you can pin your favorites to the top of the list. Thank you Chomp.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Randy Borow,"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra here. For the last few years this was my favorite SMS text messaging app. Unfortunately, that changed about 2 months ago. For some inexplicable reason, none of my outgoing messages using Chomp are received. I myself can receive messages, but when I send messages, none of my recipients get them. On my end it LOOKS like they were delivered, but none are. I've tried every fix there is, but nothing works. I simply cannot use Chomp anymore.",1
com.p1.chompsms,MoonMuk,I used to love this app. Used it for years. It's the best customization app for sms. But it recently messed my whole life up because I was not receiving important texts and it wasn't sending half my texts and I had no idea. Now I can send ten one word texts in a row to a phone and the person wont get a single text and it doesn't even say error. So I can't use this app anymore and I don't think I could trust it ever again. :(,1
com.p1.chompsms,Pamela Holmes,Great texting app Love the various colors and backgrounds that you can download. One of the few apps that allows you to have a signature at the end of your message. Also love that I can send group text. My previously messaging app was causing issues. I also like the ease if use.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Phil Loyd,"As a trucker, I could really use a voice recording feature. The ability to send and receive voice texts, rather than pulling over so often really is a big deal. An app that I previously had would do that. It allowed for up to 60 seconds of voice recording time. Please add this type of feature, and I will gladly up the rating to 5 stars. Everything else seems fine. Thanks",2
com.p1.chompsms,Jaye Eryk,"Every time I customize for my own ringtone or use a different theme, I lose the most critical points of a text app. I get ZERO notifications! After a couple of days of it working normally. I get NO audio alert when a text comes in, NOR do I get ANY sort of notification whatsoever. I have absolutely no clue I ever get a text which renders this app completely useless and uncustomizable! However, if I leave it alone, which I hate, it works fine.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Overall excellent messaging experience. The extent to which one can customize that experience is great, and this opportunity contributes greatly to the feel of the app. The only issue is the ads. While mostly unintrusive, if the app loads late it may push down a conversation that you were just about to click on, causing you to click the ad. This is but an infrequent, minor, and avoidable problem. However, I wish there were options for customizing the size and shape of the quick-reply popup.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Natasha Prentice,"Great app. The ads aren't invasive at all. Wish I could personalize the message alert tone for each of my contacts, but other than that, it's a great app * Replying, I did as recommended, but the screen shows white and at the bottom, the options to save or cancel. When I choose save, a message flashes telling me to enter info to save. It's not working.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I was looking for a new app to send messages and photos because the app that came with my android phone stopped sending photos, and I found Chomp. So far it has been working great, and after downloading 2 extra accesories I customized it to look fun, not necessary but I love having the option. The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the ads that I keep clicking on accidentaly, a bit annoying when you're in a hurry, but hey, nothing's free in this world!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Chomp is useful and dependable. Does about everything I need a text/SMS to do. There are a couple minor annoyances, as far as i can see. If I have an established group chat and want to add a new person, i have to create a new group. would rather be able to just add one to existing group. there is no warning if a picture is too large, or if it's because there is text as well, but some things fail to send, which may not be apparent until much later when I open it again. resend won't fix it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like it very much. I can control it so that it's visually easiest for me to read and write texts. The advertisements are annoying in a way that all advertisements are annoying. After a little bit of time using it though, if you wait a sec and don't accidentally fall for the trap of tapping on the top message, which is actually the ad but resembles a message, you'll likely be able to skip even glimpsing the subliminal message and not clicking on it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Great app! I've been using another app for the last 4 years and I've changed to this one. The ability to customize is incredible. The only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 are: 1. There is no draft indication. If you have to leave the app in the middle of a message and then return there is no indication of a draft message. 2. No ability to create multiple signatures. Should be able to create different signatures for different contacts. Otherwise a great app!,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"So far, less than thirty minutes of having it downloaded, it works better than a previous texting app I had. Pictures actually send. I kinda want to buy the full version, but one bad review of it hurt my chances. This is worse for me because my phone is an original Chinese version and I like the way it works right now, but don't want the ads and don't want how it works to change. I would like to be able to put different themes on each conversation though, to tell which is which easier.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Diane Smith,"Having issues...First off, I love the way your app allows us to customize the look of the app. Two issues I'm having: 1. I don't receive a pop up when I get a new text, just a little icon on the task bar on the top of the phone which is easily missed 2. Once I add a picture to a message, I can't look at the pic any more. I press on it to enlarge it and nothing happens. Even after I send the text, it won't allow me to see the pic except for the little thumbnail.",3
com.p1.chompsms,John McFarland,"Google message that comes standard on all phones is horrible. If you get ""message expired or unavailable"" then you need to download this App. I tried all the fixes for Google messages, and none worked. Chomp is great and works great. When I downloaded this app, I went into settings and made it the default app for messages and all my contacts and messages were loaded up. After about 30 days, they start showing ads, but it is just a bar at the top. No big deal. Thanks Chomp for an app that works!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love this app, used it for years since having a smartphone. My only complaint is that there isn't an easy way to clean up the conversations list. I get tons of spam texts and if I want to delete or blacklist those texts, I have to do it one at a time. Multiple blacklist and multiple delete options would be a fantastic asset to this app. EDIT: didn't know about the multi delete in the settings. I still think a multi blacklist would be useful as well. Thanks!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Nicholas Thieme,"My default texting app wasn't sending texts to my wife for some reason. I could receive them and everyone else got my outgoing, but not her. This app did the trick. I love the customization options too. I now have a dark color scheme that's much easier on the eyes. The only thing missing so far, is the ability to mark messages as ""read"" from the notification pop-up. Not a huge deal, but a minor convenience I miss.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Shows something different than what is sent. If I send a picture, it'll show a completely different picture. Same goes for text messages. It doesn't always do it. It's very irregular. I can go into the standard messaging app and never have any issues. All issues I had have been resolved with help from Chomp SMS support team. I've updated to a 5 star rating.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is really a great SMS app. I am currently using Textra and this is a definite competitor for my go to SMS app.  Just a couple of reasons why, I probably won't switch to Chomp.  1.  When viewing the list or message, the placement for a photo is a random ugly color that I cannot seem to change.  Is there a way to change this?  2. When I find a color that I like for the top bar, I want to be able to match that color all the way around, just like in Textra. It makes it very difficult to find the exact color over and over again.  Aside from that, this program has come a long way.  Thank you for resolving this for me.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Rob Perschau,"I like this app. It's clean, reliable and simple while still offering all the features I've ever wanted. I have my groups, my various notifications and my history. Speech to text works very well. Pick your color scheme and numerous other customizations. Customer service has been very responsive. Slight hitch when you take a picture from within the app and attach it to a message. It frequently will not send until you back up and reload the saved message. Not enough for me to change my rating.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Robin,"I only started using this app yesterday, but I already love it. However, I REALLY wish there was a way to split the profile pictures in group texts, to show each recipient's pic. For example, a group text with four people just shows ""4"" as the profile pic. This is not helpful if you have several group texts with different recipients. The recipients' names don't all show in the header, so you have to click each text to see if it's the one you want. Five stars if I can get this resolved!",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Mostly good except for a couple of issues. I have difficulty sending text with pictures. Most of the time I end up sending the pic and then have to send the text separately. Also the ad at the top is annoying how it jumps around when you first open the app. It makes it so you inevitably click on the ad if you are trying to reply to the most recent text quickly. And it is not ""my internet latency."" I have the fastest and have no problem with anything else.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I paid the premium price quite some time ago but at random times over the years the ads keep coming back. You have to email and explain to customer service that you've already paid, which then they then correct it to have no ads, but it's really annoying to keep having to do it from time to time. I am stuck in one of the cycles again even though I've recently gotten text prompts from their team saying that the ""messengers enhanced features have been enabled"". Aside from that I love it though!",2
com.p1.chompsms,Ford Block,"I like the app. However, I had issues editing a theme. It didn't allow me to change color of new message bubble or navigation bar. Also it says it has Backup & Restore to an SD card. My phone doesn't have a SD card slot. So I'm not sure if it will just save to the phone. So I knocked off 2 stars. Also, I wish it could add more than one signature like Textra. If these 2 apps were combined it'd be perfect. If there was a Pro version to get these features I would pay. But I don't see Pro version.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Andi S,"As a visually impaired person, the stock SMS app on Android phones is pure garbage. This is a great replacement, and gives me most of the options I need to be able to send and receive messages easily. If I could see better, I would definitely decorate up my messages a lot more because with what vision I do have I can see that the themes offered are amazing. Definitely recommend.",4
com.p1.chompsms,kimberly lock,"I'd say I am 70% satisfied with the features, but there are a few missing parts... the individual text messages do not show the exact times. they're like grouped together and have only the time to be first message of the group was sent/received. also, when you want to share a screenshot (example) with a recent text, if the text did not come from someone in your contacts, you have to go back and find the text you want to send screenshot to instead of having a list of recent conversations.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Lloyd Pulley,"so far a very good messaging program with a lot of personalization. The only issue I am encountering so far is that, while I can take pictures to send, it doesn't seem to allow me to make videos. I have been able to send videos with all my other messaging apps (why so many apps, you may ask, and I have no good answer other than darn people won't agree on one service), but on this one, while I see setting for videos, there is no way for me to access making videos that I can see.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Been using it for years. Only have had minor issues a small of handful of times, and chomp cleared them up well. Recently had an issue with in-app notifications, and they were very prompt in responding to my e-mail, with a fix that worked immediately. Sad to see the color icon notification go, but, that's Google. Otherwise, quite happy with the app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Does everything I want. I get to assign a different notification sound for each contact. I get to decide how many times I get a notification or if it continues until I read the text. I get to choose the color of everything, font type and size too. Basically, everything you have a right to control regarding how your phone handles texts, this app refuses to stand in the way. As the standard text app that comes with android becomes increasingly less functional and relevant, this app delivers.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nicole “Mickey” Maschke,"8/12/21, champ is really a wonderful application for text messaging. But it does not have an archive function. Which, with so much economic stuff going through the text messages, is really very necessary. For that reason I'm only able to give chomp four stars. But it really is an excellent application. It's just not one that can actually compete with like a few of the others. So it still needs some work.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great App! I'm another one that never gives a review but I've been using it long enough to give credit where credit is due. It's built with all the necessary features and all the many extra ones that make it that much more enjoyable. The convenience of being able to adjust when the message actually leaves after hitting the send button is a real friend at times for changing a thought at the last moment or to make a correction. Lots of features and never fails me. Great job, Thanks.. 🎶",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jim Gerry,"Very good app, but has one little flaw. Visually, it gets a perfect 5. My issue is this, if not petty, notifications. I think if you could personalize a notification for an individual conversation, or contact, like you can for a ringtone for phone calls, would be awesome. That way you know who just texted you without having to look. That would make me give it 5.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Lou Richer,"Have been using this app for years. I like all the customizations available much more than any other app. I have used them all, and this is my favorite. There's only been one issue over time that occurs once or twice a year and that is that the notification sound I've chosen stops working. The only solution is to uninstall the app, and reinstall it. I then reset the theme, choose my notification sound, and am off and running again until the next time. Even though this is a pain, it's worth it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"My Android phone was splitting up the messages every time there was a group message, causing each person's reply to come in under their contact and not as a response to the group. Lady at the store said it was because my phone is outdated (bought it in March) and said installing a new messaging app would not help. I had already tried several apps, with no results. Then I heard about ChompSMS through a Google search, and installed it. Group messaging now works properly!! I'm so happy. Plus I love the search feature, which my other app didn't have. So far, I'm very happy with it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Robyn Buchanan,"Update: I don't think my issue was related to the app. I tried this app for several months but it had an issue showing previews of pictures and attaching them. There were so many things to like about this app, though! Pinning important conversations and giving an adjustable countdown to allow messages to be cancelled were particularly useful! If you're looking for a messaging app with quite a few useful functions, I do recommend giving this one a try - it just wasn't quite what I needed.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Overall, I like the app. However, about 25% of group messages aren't delivered and I get the APN error message. I tap to retry, and nothing happens. Only when I reboot my phone do all the missing messages start to appear. I have changed the carrier size limit and that didn't affect it. Very frustrating as I have numerous groups texting to communicate with each other. I have searched for months for any info on this problem online and found nothing.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"It's great. I like it. but could add the feature of front size setting for the text itself instead of changing the whole phone. And add the reminder of missed a text message when pick up phone? I constantly have to look for the blinking light or home button to check. Also, can you add function where we can add our own backgrounds? it would be cool.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great, great, great and welcome replacement for messaging! I wasn't happy at all with the lack of features for customing the stock messaging app. I searched, found this, and there's no going back! - (added 1/30/20) Can I add a star and make 6?!? Small bug on a feature on my phone and these guys wouldn't give up until they found the solution... Invested days into making sure it worked perfectly every time!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This used to be an awesome app with all of the personalization options, but it has since gone down in the dumps. Some options like the personalized colored notification icon has been removed. I've also been missing important texts because this app blocks them for whatever reason. I've been forced to use the built-in message app that came with the phone which absolutely sucks. Hopefully this app gets back to the greatness it once was. (I also paid to remove adds)",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Update 2: Textra does the trick! Thanks!! Love the export feature for both as well as delay send! (OK, another Star!) -- Update: Added another * because the co took the time to respond plus I like the export entire text history. -- Deal breaker for me; otherwise really like. And that is, if I want to get back with someone who has text me, but I don't want to do it now, I can write the text and just exit. It will then show up as a ""Draft"" and go to the top of the list which makes it easily seen. I also use it to mark priority. I may put a blue emoji dot or a red one which shows me a priority.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Criss Lucas,this is a really nice app with good tech support. Very large fonts are available. Good for people with vision issues. Just wish there was a private box or archive box available. Stickers would be nice as well. Pro version is very reasonable. I recommend it. UPDATE: Just contacted tech support via email and response was very quick considering it was after business hours. Problem was solved. Love this app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I needed a SMS message since my default message app wasn't ideal. I looked around at reviews before trying this one. I'm glad I did! It has been everything I've needed in a texting app! It allows me to schedule texts, as my old phone did, and it has all kinds of sweet features to customize it! My husband was using Textra but has since switched. He likes how he can customize it, including enlarging the font size. Definitely worth it for free or paid! I paid because I didn't want ads 😉",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"i really like using chomp. its easy, free and i can customize it quite a bit. there is a little latency issues, but they are few and far between. my only real issue is the ad location. i dont mind the ad, especially for a free product that works as well as chomp does, but i dont like the position of the ad banner at the TOP of my contact list as i often go to click on a contact only to find its moved because of an ad. if that ad banner were moved from the top? 5 stars.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"An excellent alternative to Google Messages, chomp SMS provides a flexible experience for anyone. If you want your messaging app to resemble older versions of iOS or Android, here's your ticket. The only gripe that I have, being on a BlackBerry device, is that there are no BlackBerry-themed bubbles or message boxes, but this doesn't detract from the overall experience still.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I used to love chomp until I upgraded my Android phone and installed chomp and now it won't let me send pictures, gifs, etc and I can't send or respond to a group text. I have checked all possible settings on everything so that's not the problem. Instead of sending the above, when I hit the send button the message or picture just disappears. I can send and receive simple messages but that's it!!!! Have also installed and reinstalled chomp several times and turned the phone off and on.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have been using chomp premium for years and loving every feature. Up until recently I have never had any issues at all. Lately, however, I have been getting group message spam from numbers not in my contacts and have discovered that you can only blacklist the top number on the send list (because blacklisting is done through the conversation list). It's a shame that I may have to find a new app with stronger security features. :(",3
com.p1.chompsms,Koriania,It provides the security layer on my texts that I want. I can't find a way to send audio clips. Every other major sms app has this ability natively. This one doesn't even recognize audio files from other apps. The lack of native audio recording is disappointing. Edit: the specified audio button will neither find files from any of the major sound recording apps nor provide native recording. My problem is not that I can't find the button. Read what I wrote about recognition.,2
com.p1.chompsms,dc9wilson,"Completely useless. Even after setting ""no file size for carrier"" I still can't send a simple audio file such as a song without getting the same error message as I get through the native app. I shouldn't have to go back to a pointless platform such as Facebook just to be able to use their Messenger app which has done this since the very beginning. It's the only app for Android that seems to be able to let me send an audio or high res video file on Android. So what's the point of this app?",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Funny, they ask me to review their app when I'm about to get rid of it. It takes longer for the ads to load, than it does the app so, I'm constantly TRYING to click on the last person I texted yet, as soon as I do, the ad loads and I'm once again thrown into Amazon or some other site. I can't pinpoint specifics, it's just not super user friendly with the lack of settings you can get elsewhere. I'm going back to Textra...",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Update: as other reviews have noted, this app seems to have trouble sending texts with attached images. None of mine are going through. I've switched back to the stock app. Original review: I've only had this app installed for a day, so I'll update rating and review if I notice any negative things down the road. But 2 features led me to use this app over the stock Samsung app or Textra: ability to fully customize the background (not just ""light"" or ""dark"") and showing contact pics with text bubbles. So far so good.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Christian Mericle,"UPDATE 2: Chomp support reached out to me after my updated review and made an effort to resolve the issue. While they gave up short of actually fixing the problem, they did at least make an effort, so kudos to them for that. UPDATE: I liked Chomp SMS until I tried to send a video. Chomp includes options to attach an already-recorded video and to “Capture Video” at the time a message is being composed. However, both options fail. The latter doesn’t even try to record before stating “Can’t record video. Not enough space in attachment.” It seems odd to include options that don’t even work but Chomp SMS support confirmed that video cannot be sent with the app, stating, ""Normally, it's best to send videos using a non MMS protocol application, that doesn't have limits, like email, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp etc."" I've switched back to my phone's default texting app which has no problems sending videos. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Works well. I switched to this because my default texting app could not send a text and a photo together in a single message. I quickly upgraded to Pro after installing chompSMS.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Had the pro/paid version for a few years. No longer. Last year, started getting mms errors. Issue went away. A few updates back, kept getting errors related to mms messages again. Could not get the issue resolved. Next update fixed it. Now after the last update, the mms error message randomly comes back. Switched to the factory message app, and it works fine. Chomp needs better quality control and testing with its app updates. Love the unique features, but tired of repeat problems. Uninstalled.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have found the messenger customizable and a great interface. there is an ad at the top of my messages which is a little annoying, but I am using the free version. excellent app for messaging. have been using for a month now and am very pleased. woth a try in my opinion. I didnt even keep looking after I found it, it had more than I expected. emoji options are great",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Horrible job handling MMS. I have the paid version and have been using this app for years. It's a simple clean interface. That's the good; however, there have been chronic issues with handling MMS especially with pics. Also, not updated often enough to keep it functional and fresh. I'm searching for a replacement.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Shelby D,"Customization is kind of nice but it will resend messages to the receiver multiple times until you delete that message. Don't use if you don't want to inadvertently annoy the hell out of everyone you text. Update: Not a carrier issue. No other messaging app does this, and if you look up the issue on Chomp's help pages, it's been an issue with the app since at least 2018. Deflection isn't help, but thanks.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I would have given it a 5 except the ad pop up at the top is incredibly annoying. I don't care so much that they are doing ads to support the technology but hate that it occupies the same space as the new incoming message so if you got it to fast you almost always open the ad. Not cool. It is Rich in features and has enough customization but they need to put the ads on the bottom.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,A very good app. A couple of things could be made better. 1) The notification ringtone of the unread message reminder should be customizable instead of having it be the same one as the incoming message. 2) Font sizes and colors of contact's name and number in the conversation action bar should each be customizable as well. *Special note: The ad link at the top of the conversation list - misleading and annoying. Looks too much like a contact. Should be at the bottom or its appearance changed.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I am enjoying most of the options provided by this app. The 1st thing I did was enlarge the font. So far my favorite options are being able to choose a background (including pics from my pic gallery), also changing the bubble color and last but not least having the option to schedule texts. The app has been running smoothly for me so far.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"The default Messages app on my new phone was a source of torment -- glitchy, unreliable and randomly asking me whether I would like to switch my texting app from Messages to Messages. When my sister repeatedly sent me a photo I couldn't see, she suggested I break up with the Messages twins and try Chomp. A few seconds later, I not only had the photo, but all of my incoming texts were bug-free and a pleasure to open. Chomp is visually appealing, too!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sapphire Moon,"I love the various themes and the optional time stamps, but one thing I don't like is the notifications. I have a friend of mine whose texts come in batches (i.e. split up) and, for some reason, this app thinks that I need to be notified for each one (so, if the text is split into three parts, this app will ring three times, one right after another). It's really annoying and there's no setting to fix it. If it weren't for that, I'd probably give this app five stars.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Rob Box,"So. I was originally very happy with this app. So much I paid for the pro version when my free trial expired. Little did I know that it wasn't showing mms videos or multiple images sent in the same texts. Once I hopped on any other messaging app, I was able to view the information I had missed over the past month. Absolutely unacceptable and besides the customization, an absolute failure of an application.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Lucy v,"Update: I'm so disappointed that I will have to delete this app. I've come to realize that I'm missing several messages from people. That's a deal breaker unfortunately. Original Review: I've been using chomp for over a year now and its by far my favorite messaging app. I recently had to upgrade my phone and because iphone was not an option to use chomp on, it was ONE of the several determining factors in choosing to go with a Samsung again. It's been very useful with little to no issues.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I upgraded to the LG Stylo 4 from 3. They took away the ability to customize things. I got Chomp to see if i could change the look of my texts. i was surprised that i could change EVERYTHING about the way my texts look. It's really cool and the ads are only at the top of the thread list, they don't bother me at ALL. I love this app! Highly recommend. 😁",5
com.p1.chompsms,Capn B,"I've been using this for a couple of days while Next SMS was down. I like that it's lightweight, I don't think I've even seen an ad, and it can do almost everything Next SMS can do. However, there are some limitations to how I can make conversation bubbles and pop-ups look. More importantly, if I need to add or remove someone from a text thread, there is no way way to do this, instead I have to recreate the thread from scratch and add every contact all over again.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Crystal,"This app is great! You have 6 LED light colors to choose from (and the none option too) as long as your phone supports them, and you can completely customize how everything inside looks with themes. Everything from text size to colors is customizable, and you can have more than one theme saved. (I have 7.) And if you want to change part of a theme, you don't have to redo it. Just edit the theme and tap 'Save changes'. For the person who loves to customize, this is perfect & easy to use overall!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using Chomp for a few years now. And have recommended to several others. Love the customization! Only recently bought the full version, it was fine with the little bit of ads but it was only a few bucks to get ad-free. Love the ability to search and email conversations as well. Can't see using anything else. Great app!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very good texting app overall, love how customizable it is. Only real problem I've had so far is in group texts sometimes a text shows as coming from ""anonymous"" instead of showing the sender's name. It seems random and I'm pretty sure it has happened with more than one sender. otherwise it has been pretty stable and reliable.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Christie Cook,"I absolutely love this app! This is all I've used for texts (for the past couple years- sclsince I discovered it). Why? I can... - put a lock screen upon opening - stop a text after hitting send, based on your settings (I use like 2.5 seconds) - write a text & schedule it to send for a different time & date, which I use frequently - fully customize literally every detail of the appearance, including customizing the many download options. I highly recommend this app!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Apple Starlight,"Awesome texting app for anyone who can't stand the plain default texting from their provider. Can customize your own background image, text font, size, color, and even down to the color of the dot to your unread messages. Both the page of tects as well as individual text chats can be customized the same way. The easiest to understand and work with and the only app I've used for years. Very prompt and this one does not delay texts like many others do.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Lou Northern,"My needs are simple. Write a message, send a message. And be obnoxious to people with a few random GIF's. Chomp meets my needs, has a nice interface, seems rock solid. Yeah, you get the occasional ad, but they don't obstruct getting a message done (small bar at the top sort of thing). So, yeah I would recommend it. BUT.... Google play store and firefox... Not so much. Took several minutes and finally clicking the shield button and turning off enhanced protection to be able to write a review.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Dr Scribbles-McSniffle PhD.,"I usually never give five stars to an app with ads, but the ads in this app, which only start once the trial is over, are limited to a minimally invasive banner at the top of the inbox taking up the same amount of space as a message thread. This has definitely been a better upgrade from the default text messaging app that came on my phone. Highly recommend!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jule A,"I LOVE this app! So many customizations and I was happy to pay for it to remain ad free after the trial. It works much better than my stock messaging app as well. My only issue, but not worth losing a star, is it doesn't appear to allow you to block a number straight from the app. I have to go I to my contacts for that. But other than that, it has been an awesome experience. OnePlus 8 5G",5
com.p1.chompsms,christopher t,"I've been using this for several years with relatively no problems. Now, though, it just quits about 4 or 5 times a day and also it isn't sending MMS consistently anymore. Fix these bugs, please!!! OK, after receiving extraordinary help from one of the support staff, my problems have been fixed. Thanks so much - and chomp is once again my favorite texting app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Stephen Hagberg,"I do recommend this app without reservation. It integrates well with one of the computer texting intermediate programs and is a pleasure to use. I will take some time to modify the schemes and such to my tastes, but cannot complain. Thank you for building this program and for putting it out there for use. Not sure if it's my phone, but it does crash a time or two during the day but immediately resets. And I am fine with that. Again, you have a great case to be made for being heads and shoulders above the Android texting apps, and even the stated preferred app by the folks at MightyText that is supposed to fit perfectly. Great product and great attitude for excellence",4
com.p1.chompsms,Brenda Martin,"Great app. I've been using this for several years. My two favorite features are future delivery for messages and notification customization. I can have a distinct ringtone for each contact. This way, I don't even have to look at my screen to know who is texting me. Very useful feature. Also, if you ever have a technical issue and need help, their support team is top notch.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Charity “Cherdy”,"I have been using a different text app for eeons and I kept trying to send little short videos and they wouldn't go cuz they were too big (seriously!) I tried others, didn't like em, So I went back to my standby and I had to reset everything. Grrr. Chomp is free! It won't send my videos either but I'll figure it out. The one thing I would prefer is an option to color code each of my contacts differently. I'm 97% visual and I wanna see who is texting me right off.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using Chomp for a few years. I like the app for texting. I very much dislike its unreliability sending photos. Some go through in a few seconds - others never do. Sometimes I have to try several times. Another negative is its refusal to send messages that contain German and Spanish letters such as ä, ö, ü and é. An app that is supposed to enable communication should not have these flaws.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Sam Barnes,"Great app with LOTS of features that other similar apps don't have. Unfortunately, there are several bugs which the developer doesn't seem interested in fixing but maybe they only affect me so it's not worth their time. Also, it's a little slow and a slightly old design when compared to it's sister app Textra ... but that's just me getting picky. :-) Otherwise it's easily the best texting app for Android.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Rose Ford,"I was looking for an SMS messaging app, that was better than the one pre-installed on my Samsung Galaxy Note 20, (I like to have fun with my messages) when I came across Chomp. It is wonderful! I LOVE the ease of use, and I'm able to customize everything, except the ring tones, for each person, it's just one ring tone set for all messages, and I'd prefer each person have their own. Other than that, it's a great app. Give it a try! 😀😀",5
com.p1.chompsms,Dan Sullivan,I've used various sms programs over the last couple of years. Chomps is solid and one of the best. The ability to rename a group message title would be nice instead of just showing up as a list of names. Also the ability to remove someone from a group message would be really useful when someone sends a group and someone asks to be removed,4
com.p1.chompsms,John Anderson,"I have tried more than a few apps and this is the best I have found. My number one requirement is the app has to have quick text templates. This does and it works well. Works well with camera too. I didn't give it a 5 because I would like an easier way to quickly delete messages. Chomp allows multiple deletes, but I would like to see another line or two of the subject text before I delete. A one step swipe would be best.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Bryce Scholz,"I used Textra for long time, then discovered chomp. At first i wasn't sure, jus creature of habit, but then turned out i really like it. The app is great, the ways to personalize are amazing. Two reasons why i didn't give 5 stars. It's a lil buggy sometimes, kicks me out, backs up on its own. And you can't change the color of the app icon. Other then that, it's an amazing app. The ads are so minor that u hardly even notice them. Great job",4
com.p1.chompsms,D M,I have been using this app for quite some time and it has always worked properly. Since your last latest greatest update chomp keeps on crashing. I get a message that says unfortunately chop has quit working. Edit Not much has changed it doesn't crash quite as much after their help and reinstalling it now quite frequently it takes forever to send a simple text or MMS. This is a very unstable app. Sometimes it takes forever to just open the app,1
com.p1.chompsms,aje3721,"I've finally had it with this app. I've lost notification sounds for chomp for the last time. It's happened over three devices over the years. It's pretty bad when you can Google an issue and a pole of people experience the same thing. I'm done. Rather than recommending all users try this and try that, why don't YOU fix it for everyone.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Haley Ortegon,"Downloaded chomp because my phone has zero customization for the text screen. There's been a couple times when I saw that messages I thought sent didn't send, but other than that it's worked as says. Super customizable, when your free trial runs out the only ad is what looks like another message at the top of your messages, but you know it's an ad so it's not hard to avoid. I recommend if your phone doesn't offer any customization on the text screen.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Meredith Zarth,"Chomp SMS is great! There really are SO many customization options and everything seems to be working as it should - now that I have leared a little more on how to use it. Some of the features don't seem quite that intuitive. Still trying to figure out how or if I can send SMS via MMS, as my longer texts keep breaking up on the receiving end. Would be nice to find a way around that. I also added aodNotify to get an LED notification equivalent - as I lost the LED moving from S8 to S20. Luckily, Chomp SMS and aodNotify seem to be working together alright.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Harley,"The only messaging app I'll ever use. I love the customization it allows. You can create how you want ever element to look, from the background, bubble style, font, colors, everything. You can even send your creation and submit it to the developer to become one of the premade design options others can choose from to use also! I've used Chomp for the better part of a decade now, and I'll continue to use it on every device I own as long as it's available.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"if you reply to a text you may get an error telling you to use a valid phone number.

I wish i could combine the features of each. i guess there is no perfect messaging app. I will keep switching depending on what I'm trying to do.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Keri Burns,"I love this app and have used it for YEARS, mostly because of the delayed sending option that my default messaging app doesn't have. But in the last few weeks, the notification settings aren't working properly. Every text keeps reverting back to Custom which makes every text vibrate as well as the default tone I have assigned to it. Even though I've selected Vibrate Only When Phone on Vibrate in both the overall settings and for each contact. Please fix this bug if possible!",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I decided to try chomp because my messages app kept cutting me off from group messages that involved people on i-phones. Very weird. Well chomp seems to work great. The choice of skins is really nice and easier on the eye. The only cons ... there doesn't seem to be search capability which I really depend on sometimes...and I haven't figured out how to coordinate chomp with my samsung gear. Otherwise...no complaints.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Corey Lewis,"It works okay, but has a few issues. -It builds a cache constantly which grows to the hundreds of MBs and will fill up your phone unless you manually clear it. My phone was full and sending me errors, because this app had 400mb of cached information. Why doesn't it clear itself regularly? -Messages with pictures attached are slow to load as it processes and compresses the files. -Ads at the top load slowly, meaning sometimes you click on the wrong message thread as the ad tries to reload itself. -Sometimes it will get an error where it flat out refuses to add a picture to a message, it just doesn't work. But the biggest issue ever: The app puts a ""1"" country code in front of your phone number in the settings. This will *prevent* websites/verification texts from getting to you, as the website will send out such texts to your number without the 1. You will also miss texts from people at times because of this. Make sure you go into your settings and manually take off the 1. It affected me for months and I never knew why. It shouldn't even allow you to edit your phone number anyway, that's asking for trouble.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Irene LaFortune,"Compared to other top sms apps, this is my absolute favorite. Easy to use, highly customizable (including in particular, delayed sending options which I like), displays more conversations (10 on my pixelxl) than some other apps, text is very easy to read, able to easily block unwanted senders, backs up automatically using Google backup service, responsive help desk. Only con, is can't sync to a desktop, but when I want to do that, I just switch to another app temporarily.",5
com.p1.chompsms,vickie monte,"This is why I think this Chomps apps should be standard on ALL phones: 1-it allows user to add a signature. THANK YOU! 2-each text message displays date and time. FANTASTIC for documentation! 3-it allows user to get feedback on when message was sucessfully sent. AWESOME! Suggestion so far: sometimes I start a text message and have to finish it later. So it would be helpful to start a text message, backout and apps keep as draft even without a defined recepient.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Bryan McCormick,"the default Android messaging app was not sending pictures, so i went looking for an alternative. three bucks is perfectly reasonable for chomp. the background customization isn't that important but it's nice. it's not a dramatic improvement but i am happier with it than the android default. with Android, the picture could take up to twenty minutes to send out, more frequently they wouldn't send at all, sometimes saying that they did but the person never received them. chomp works how it should.",5
com.p1.chompsms,SFG / GSW,"Good app but not there yet. It needs way more customization capabilities for the visual aspects. Had to stop using it though because I tried to send a 26 second video and it said the video was too large so then I tried it with two other messaging apps and they both allowed me to send the video and it was delivered. When sending a picture, it should pull up a list of most recent people messaged instead of having to always go through address book.",2
com.p1.chompsms,James HYi,"It takes forever for pictures to show up. It is very annoying. I would have thought after how many years I've owned this app that they would eventually fix this issue. The default Google Messenger app does not have this issue, but Chomp apparently does. I really wish they would fix this. When you click on a picture to bring It Up full screen it takes a very long time to display. And no I will not contact your technical support. I have better things to do.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Fred Iccini,Edit 12/02: The feature I use the most has been replaced with the conversation sound instead of the individual sound - the main reason I used ChompSMS. Original review: ChompSMS is the only SMS app/add-on I've been able to find which can have different text sounds for individual contacts instead of individual conversations (which does me no good). I haven't had any issues with chomp and I hope it continues to be better than all the rest!,2
com.p1.chompsms,Melissa Turner,Great messaging app with lots of options. My main reasons for downloading this app are the many features and the ability to change formats. My native app is not working correctly outside the US and sometimes texts will not send until I click another button to switch to/from MMS. Chomp solved this issue for me and I no longer have problems with texting from outside the US.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Alicia Brown,The best app hands down!! I've had them all pulse etc... If you are an Android fan. This is what you have been waiting for. All the customization you didn't even know you needed. Just a few things I'm a little picky about. Having the preview of the web link would be helpful. I like to preview before I open. The pop up menu glitches sometimes and doesn't pop up also would love to be able to change that background to one from my own pics and not just a color. Other than that I would give it 5 !!,4

com.p1.chompsms,Wolfgang Willis,I prefer Samsung's Messaging App but my newest phone would not adjust the text size to the exact size I wanted it to be. Either too BIG or too SMALL along with some minor other issues but Chomp addresses all that and more! Like Samsung's app you can get premade Themes or make your own including custom backgrounds etc etc! Plus if you choose you can set all incoming messages to have colored bubbles and no pesky green ones!! =) - BUT the one thing which is hard to live without is being able to just long hold and select just the text you want to copy. Chomp makes you copy the entire text message. grrr. annoying!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Gazelle,This was an amazing experience! My phone was having a very difficult time letting me customize. They worked diligently figuring out a pretty unique problem and created a link to download into my phone that allowed this to happen. They went up and Beyond any expectations and when I told them it was okay and was about to give up they persisted and after days we got it working! I could not be happier and more pleased.

Update: seems to be working as expected with android 11.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Has a nice clean interface and LOTS of themes. Also very easy to associate text from certain sources with a particular ringtone or notification.  I really LOVE that as I do not have to look to know who the text is from.  I run this on an LG V20 and so far am very pleased with it.   They do not nag you to upgrade.   I will be willing to pay for this to help the folks who code it. I had an issue and they replied via email very quickly and helped me.   Not too many apps have that support.l  Would like to see it easier to delete an entire convo from text and suggested it.  Hopefully I will see that someday...   Thanks,5
com.p1.chompsms,Femi A.,"Chomp was working well most of the time for years. But as of the past week or so, it frequently quits unexpectedly and repeatedly, to the extent that I can not send or read texts. Moto G5 Plus (Android) phone. Love this app. It's working a little bit better now that I tried the developer's fix, but it's still not quite as good as it used to be. But thank you.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"There are couple of problems I found with this app. Problem with sounds. For some reason it will not play some sounds. Lot of times i don't get message notifications. The reason I got this app, so I can delete individual messages. It does that nicely but not getting notifications about a message is annoying so I'm not sure I want to keep this app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Shirley Johnson Hawley,"Better than the message that came on my phone. Two things I am not happy with are the ring tones don't always keep working like I changed them. They seem to revert to different ringtones I set for all calls. Also, can't seem to click on attachments or gifs to make sure I am sending the correct photo from my gallery unless I go out of this app and click on the photo I want to share from my gallery and share from there. Or hit send then I can click and see it. Too late if I accidently send.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"SO MAD AT THE MOMENT! I've had this app for years and have LOVED it! I love how I can customize it, and schedule text to send. I have a business so I DEPEND on my text messages! I had several clients start calling telling me they had been texting and worried something was wrong when they hadn't heard back. I was ready to rip my provider, but I checked the built in texting app first for some reason, and they did show up there, so it was CHOMP 😭🤬",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Continuously almost perfect, if it's possible I'd like the option to completely block messages with multiple recipients, or at the very least turn notifications off for MMS messages but keep them on for SMS messages.

com.p1.chompsms,Zakk Sabotage,"This app is extremely annoying! Group messages are not separated, and somehow will duplicate every message you receive. It has major problems sending MMS, and will notify you about it. The ad in the free version is at the top of the list of people but takes a second to load, so if you tap your top person as it loads, it will think you tapped the ad. If you have to make alterations to your phone to get the app to work, it's not a good app.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,So far so good.... Love all the personal touches you can add to each individual contact. Love how when you add a contact a notification sound that sound comes through even in a group text. Just wish they had a way to send video's! There is no compression tool in the app to compress video's yet. If it had this I would give it 5 stars and buy the full version!!,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I can't seem to use the capture video program part of the app. Keep getting error message/black screen than it closes and says there's not enough storage. It use to work until I upgraded phone to a Note 10+. I've cleared cache and data. Still an issue. I set chomp as my default messanger because I love the customize theme part. I switched back to my regular messanger and have no issue there.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Sira Vista,"It's the best texting app it there and yet it still falls short. The support for sending animated GIFs from device storage doesn't fully work in that the result (in chomp) is a still image. Other apps show the animation, but not chomp. Also searching messages is limited and there is no way to refine your search results. It is one of the few messaging applications where you can set a notification tone on a per person basis. This even works in group conversations.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Faz Khan,I got this to deal with group text messaging issues. I've had better luck using this then with textera and google's own app. My issues are not fixed but infinitely better. The most annoying thing is the subject field which cannot be turned off. The other thing is deleting conversations needs to be done one at a time. The ads are at the top which is mildly annoying but not intrusive. Its free so im fine with that. Overall it's a solid app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I was hoping you can view 2-3 contact photos in the Conversation List when seeing a multiple contact message. Instead, you see the Number of the contacts involved and then you have tap that Number to view the contact photos. You should be able to look at it without tapping each one. Too tedious & not pleasantly pleasing... I don't want to see a big number ""2"" or ""3"" with multiple contact messages. I want to see smaller split photos in the circle. It would be faster to scroll & see the photos.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,So far so good. Been using chomp for a few months. Used to use Textra but it stopped being able to receive attachments from iPhone devices and some messages. Could not resolve and I hate the Samsung messaging app. Chomp is very configurable and so far has not had many issues. I would like to be able to have a few features added that Textra had but will send those requests through support.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Karl Lorenz,"This is the best SMS that I have found. It combines E-Mail, MS Office Word and SMS. There are so many options to explore; an owner's manual should be included. Fortunately, Customer Service is outstanding. I was given step-by-step instructions on how to enlarge the font for easy reading with old eyes. Suggestions for improvement are promptly addressed. I made a suggestion and within one week it was added! If Chomp is not already perfect for you, suggest improvements and it will be!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Fishman Field,"UPDATE: on July 20th, I gave the Chomp app a one star rating because it had stopped working. However, today (July 22), I'm updating my rating to 5 stars. The Chomp team immediately reached out to me and have worked diligently to fix the problem. Two days later, they have provided a fix and my app is now functioning perfectly again. This was not a mobile carrier issue as the solution did not come from t-mobile, it came from Chomp. I value the effort that was made to find/fix the problem!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Its an ok app. my main issue with it is when I send multiple pictures more than half the time it just sends one or two, I know how to change the settings with limit restrictions but it doesn't seem to matter, had the same problem with Textra.

Has everything they do... except just wish if u started a draft text but did not send it, it would move the convo to the top and show you the first few characters. SUPER annoying if you meant to send and didnt by accident and then you have to scroll through and find that convo. Maybe it's in paid version? If so I would buy!! Also, some contacts are not pulling thru to send msgs too. No idea why...",4
com.p1.chompsms,Adrian Cruzado,"Chomps is a great app. Better than the message app in my phone. The only thing I don't like is assigning notifications tones to my contacts. The notification tone is for everything. I just want to give all my contacts their own tones, not here the same tone for EVERY notification that I receive. But I still like it and use it every day. Now the notifications tone works sometimes. It is not constant!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Bob Chmielewski,"This app is great. There are only a couple of things that I wish it did the first is allow me to create groups on the fly and then select those groups to send a textthe second is certain kinds of attachment will not go directly into this app. For that reason, I have to keep to text applications on my phone and switch between them on occasion.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Ron Widner,"I originally gave this 5 stars (below) but had to revise to 1 star. After changing my sim card (to Verizon from ATT) I suddenly could not send any texts that contain photos. I changed every setting that could be related to this problem, but nothing worked. Unfortunately, Chomp has no support and a very limited knowledge base. I'll come back if this problem gets fixed. Original review (was 5 stars) Tried several and this is the best I've found. I need for texts to make an audible sound and keep making a sound until I view or answer it. Chomp allows for that and lets me choose the sound and the repeat interval. Seems like they would all work this way but practically none do. Good job, Chomp",1
com.p1.chompsms,Chris Courtade,"Update - the latest version of Android does not allow the import of downloaded fonts. Is there any way to fix this? I love creating my own themes and would love to share them. Huge fan. Best SMS app. I wanted to throw a suggestion out there. It sure would be swell to have swipe options in the message list. Swipe one way to reply and the other to delete, or a choice of options. Just wanted to suggest it. Thanks for a great app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,This is the 4th phone that I've used chomp for texting. It has every option I've ever wanted or needed I do love it. There's one thing I'm not crazy about and that is the print or font options. I'm just looking for regular print like a single lined print it's easier for me to see so I do wish they had that. But all my gosh this is a great app and I've been using it for quite a while,5
com.p1.chompsms,Matt Lewis,"I love this app except for 1 little thing that makes it completely unusable. You can't rename group texts? I have 10-15 groups at any one time for work, personal, etc. Many of the members of each group overlap, but without the ability to rename them ""coworkers,"" etc, the conversation list is just a confusing list of a million names where you can only see the first 1 or 2 for each. Unfortunately, I only realized this after spending 2.5 hrs setting everything else up exactly how I wanted it. :-(",2

Used to be able to send 10 or 12 pics in a text. Now only 1 pic. Worked great for years until early July. But for now I'll use another app. Tried about 5 others & they're all able to send multiple pics, I'm totally puzzled by this. Used it for years sending multiple pics, now it doesn't anymore, but other apps do.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Rebecca Tucker-White,"I love using(Chomp), I can type up a message and schedule it for a specific time then I am done. I aint got to worry about it delivering to that person; it always makes it to them on time. The app itself has so many different ways and themes to set up and change. You can edit almost everything, from the picture to the color of the # in the clock. I suggest using this app over anything.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Narges Sayyadi,"I've been using Chomp for two years. It has everything that anyone can expect from a messaging app and more! It's very user-friendly and you can customize it in any way that you want. The customer service is perfect! Once something happened to my app, so I contacted them and asked for help. They replied in no time! After about a week or so, they fixed the bug. They're very responsible and they really care about users. Install it on your phones right now without any further ado!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nik C,"I had been using the Mood messaging app for a # of yrs due to the customization features...then it became very ""glitchy"" with lots of delays. Fortunately, after some research, I landed on Chomp. I am more than pleased with the customization that it offers and it's ease of use! It works exactly as described without any ""glitches"" YAY!! One request for future updates: I'd love to be able to use my personal images for theme backgrounds. Thanks for a great app!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Lots of good stuff here, a couple of annoying things. It's a pain to have to go though multiple steps to delete convos. A swipe delete, or remember this action for further deletes to get it to a long press and delete would work well. Trying to match a color you want through your entire theme is difficult. Either a use this color for all, or at least have the color value available to copy/paste would help. Bugs me to see NO SUBJECT when someone sends a pic. Don't think that's necessary.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Angelique Jackson,"Pretty decent messaging program. I wish I could see just the media sent between the person/people I've been texting with (i.e. Signal).

com.p1.chompsms,Libby T,"I had a seven day ad free trial (that I was actually unaware of, thanks) and it was great. Once the trial ended though, Chomp started glitching a bit. Still a great app, but it sometimes kicks me off the app randomly when I'm trying to scroll through GC (group chat) messages. The ads are very small and not invasive 👌. Apart from kicking me off the app randomly, even with ads, this app is usable.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I was using ""Messages"" because it came with my phone. Soon I found the notification ringtone was not working. Many others experienced the same thing. When I Googled what was the #1 texting app, the reply was Messages. When I asked what was the #2 app, the reply was Chomp SMS. Soo, I installed Chomp. It works flawlessly. It is easy to change ringtones and use the setup features. This should be the #1 texting/messaging app, hands down. Thank you.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This used to be a fantastic app. Not anymore. The emojis changes constantly. One time you can find an emoji here the next time the same emoji is in another category. Sometimes they no longer exist. I'm have a problem sending mms files, and sometime just plan text messages, again. I switched over to another app and there's no problems. Voice recognition for voice to next has gone so far downhill I can't even use it.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Rick Buffington,"I'm not really pleased with this app. They tout a blocklist feature that doesn't work for group SMS messages. You can't even leave feedback on the app because the UI is so poorly developed that the keyboard populates on the screen in a way that renders the submit button useless. I may just get a flip phone, because big tech has truly destroyed even the most basic of technology functions. The fact I cannot submit feedback within the app due to an incompatible UI is both laughable and ludicrous.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Tweety,"Had Chomp for a few years and love it. Suddenly last night 5/5/20 everyone was quiet! No text from anyone. While trying to text someone, all I saw was a black screen! Both my husband and I with our S9 and S9+. Had to go back to Messages and saw my missed texts. My sister with her S10 seems to be working fine. We have written in an inquiry and waiting for a response. Will update post once issue is fixed. Chomp's recommendation is to uninstall-install app. Not happy to hear that. Moving to 2 stars",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I give the app credit for having awesome designs for conversations. My problems are that you never really know when a message delivers because it does not say. Most the time it actually does Not send. You also can not send any sortov video over a few seconds. When you receive any video it treats it as though you receive a virus. This app really needs improvement. 😕,2
com.p1.chompsms,K Hodge,"I like the app so far since it's a lot like handcent (next sms). The only things I want to see changed are better spam filters and the option for individual conversation theme settings instead of one picture for all messages. It'd also be cool to get the message reactions on this one too (it's nice to see those as they are and not as a new text that ""this person reacted to your message"".",4
com.p1.chompsms,nautiguy,"When you click on the text link in contacts, the dialer app, or any other app that takes you to the meesages app to send a text to that person it opens up Chomp to an existing contact (usually the same one) withe their name in the to line and a bunch of tips in the message area. There is nothing there that pertains to the person that you just sent there from contacts or wherever.",3

Today I noticed that although all permissions and notifications are set correctly Chomp refuses to make a notification sound when I receive messages. I've missed some rather important texts due to this. Disappointing.

It's frustrating.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Kevin Keller,"Good app. Probably best out there, however, recently the app does not allow me to add photos or gifs to the body of the text, which is the reason for the low rating.

com.p1.chompsms,Juliet Markowski,"Absolutely in love with it. It can be personalized to your own taste, themes, fonts, emojis, color fonts and different way of a messaging app. I have already told ppl how much I love this new message app. 😍❤️ Update it no longer works like it did when I first downloaded it. I don't get messages or sometimes the notification doesn't work. You can't delete any texts messages so you have a bunch of texts messages that you don't want. It's been glitchy. So I uninstalled it.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Rocky Spino,"After years of loyal use of another premium messaging app....and non-existent support from its developers....I decided to bail. What a nice surprise to find Chomp! Not only does it provide the ""full"" customization I desire, but also real live customer support!! App set-up was user-friendly, and my must-have features were easy to find. When I did reach out with a question, I got an immediate and accurate response. Wow!! Appreciate using this fun app...and not feeling under-supported! 🙂",5
com.p1.chompsms,Ken Regel,"Works like a champ. I have a Galaxy10 which the native messaging app stinks, so I was using Google Messaging which started to get REALLY problematic in not sending messages. So I switched to Chomp, I am mostly happy, its quick, doesn't hang up and just works without issue. My only complaint is it doesnt have a swipe to delete function, you have to longpress a msg, select delete then answer a follow confirm, which sucks.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Johnny Reyes,I've used chomp off and on for several years and always seem to come back to it. No problems with notification sounds for individuals. Only gripe would be that I wish they would increase the size of photos allowed and also videos don't seem to go through as they appear to be too large in size. Other than that it's a great app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"DON'T DO IT!!! Although it works wonderfully at first, once the ads kick in not only will the app malfunction and stop receiving & sending texts, but even after you delete the app you can NEVER get the ads from your phone!

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I like this app. I switched from an app I had use for years through multiple phones. I would love to be able to pull down the notification in the notification bar ablnd read the entire message.

com.p1.chompsms,Jim Chong,Definitely love this app. There are specific features of this texting platform that are unique and I specifically love the ability for scheduled messages as well as being able to send group messages with people being able to respond to the group or yes back to me. Easy-to-use and lots of flexibility in the interface.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Nobody Atall,"I've been using chomp for probably 8 years now & I absolutely love it . It has the most awesome interfaces that you can edit with your own fonts and colors to make texting any way you want it. It's the best app that I've ever used & I tried them all before I decided on Chomp. It has all the features such as blacklisting, deleting whole conversations, forwarding, delayed message sending and your choice of emojis, U don't have to stick with what Android tells you.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,It's stupid that android decided to get rid of the signature option in messages so that's what led me to this messaging app. I've used others but the versatility of Chomp is excellent. It's worth the less than $3 to pay for the app and lose the ads. I had an issue with changing font size and the response from support was quick and helpful.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,on the free version ads are well timed to pop up in the conversation list in a way that shifts the conversations causing me to select the wrong one. if i am selecting the first conversation its where the ad shows up and i end up going to the ad page quite often without meaning too. i dont mind having ads if its free but there should be a more tasteful way of displaying them where the user isnt tricked into clicking on them.,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Works great - far better than most Android messaging apps on my Pixel 2. There's only a couple things i wish it could do. First is sync messages (MMS/SMS) with my Chromebook and Chromebox the way iPhones can sync with Macs. Second, if like to be able to ""like"" or ""laugh at"" messages, like on iPhones. I have actually paid for the app, though, and it's definitely with it as far as I'm concerned - I do a /lot/ of messaging, and this has been the only message app that's worth it! Keep it up!",4

One would expect that Standards for these basic functions (SMS/MMS) would be as fixed as those for storage devices and networks.

Its an excellent texting app. Its extensive customization options is a great solution for users with less than perfect eyesight. But the tiny editing area of only 3 lines was the deal breaker. Having to keep scrolling back and forth to see what I've was annoying as hell. Especially with today's larger screen phones, having a 3 line editing window is nonsense. Yaata has same level of user options with larger edit area. [Glxy A20 unbranded]",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love the customization options! I downloaded a ton of other sms apps before finding this one and none of them had the varierty or versatility of this one. Most importantly, the ads for the free version dont pop up and interupt texting like most apps with a variety of background choices; ads are a simple small uninstrusive banner at the top of the messages. Would highly reccomend this app!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"used to think Chomp was great, but now whenever I scroll through text conversations, it jumps so much that it is impossible to navigate. It does not stay where your finger is on the screen. It's extremely frustrating and disorienting, so I might have to switch texting apps, unless they can fix this.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Chomp works very well. It remains one of the most customizable SMS/MMS Messengers today but I'm afraid time has finally passed it by. It works fine with Samsung's RCS. Lots to like, but you still cannot export vCards, there are no GIF's except thru keyboard, no Stickers, no sneak preview of web links, MMS messages don't appear in the Quick reply, and no way to mute group chats. The good, the quick reply still works including lock screen. Textra is better.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Just noticed I've been missing incoming messages. Checked my normal messaging app that comes pre-installed after about a year or more of using this and found a bunch of messages I hadn't received. Carrier is T-mobile, please fix this asap as I really like this app. Edit: After messing around for a while trying to find a fix, I found that making my built in app the default app again, and then making chomp the default app again fixed the issue.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Kathy S,"So far I really like this. I've tried half a dozen and I think this is the one. I do wish for 3 things: (1) that links sent to me were live links so I wouldn't have to copy and paste into my browser to see; (2) ability to swipe messages into a general Archive folder to get them off my home message screen; and (3) intercept the Apple IOS ""Liked"" function that repeats the entire message you sent and replace with an emoji or something. Good luck to your company!",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Google had temporarily prevented colored icons on the notification panel and on the always on screen. At that time you guys took that option away. However, for a while now the option is back and other apps are doing it. Can we get our colored icons back? Also, can we make it possible to pick the color based on the specific contact? This would allow us to tell at a glance who texted, even if we were not present to hear the specific notification tone.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Wooper,"I have been using ChompSMS off and on since I purchased it in 2013-2014. The amount of customizations is unmatched besides mayber their other product, Textra. While the app is functional, it is disappointing that hardly anything has been been in its appearance. It appears to be stuck in 2014 - but maybe it works in its favor. If you want a more modern looking SMS with modern design language, check out Textra.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Brenda McCreary,"I knew nothing about the Chomp app, I took a chance and installed it and I love ❤️ it. It does what I want to do, easy to use. Update: Sept 8, 2021, I'm still using the Chomp app, I still prefer it to others, BUT I have not been able to send or receive MMS messages & I cannot figure out how to fix this problem. I have researched online for days, have not found the fix.. I have seen many others with the same issue. Please fix or tell me how. Frustrating!!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Randall Morris,"I decided to give this app a try. Really really like it a lot. All the custom settings are great. I like to be able to have a certain notification for my text messages. This app allows me to set a custom notification just for my text messages. That way when I hear it, I don't have to wonder if it's a text message, email or anything else possible. The adds are not bad at all. There's just one add that pops up on the top of your messages, no big deal at all. I will continue to use it on any phone.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jennifer Cannady,"Only thing I do not like is that it won't let me send videos; says they're too big no matter how short it is. I have to reactivate my old SMS to send a video, then reactivate Chomp when I'm done. Maybe it's me or my phone!! I don't send vids often so it's no trouble. Other than that, app is much, much better than stock SMS that accompanied my phone.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Grant,"Great replacement for my default messenger. Only issue I ran into was that Amber alerts seem to be repeated indefinitely if you have the ""repeat alert"" option on.

com.p1.chompsms,Del Doherty,"I like it, there's more customizability and options for when and what of a message you're trying to send. when the free version expired, I barely noticed aside from the message telling me it was. there's only a small boundry ad at the top of the convo list only. the only complaint I have is some of my emojis don't show up. I see them on my keyboard, can see them in the message draft, can't see a few after I sent them, but my friend I send them to can see them. only a few do this so its minor.",4
com.p1.chompsms,D L,"Very good phone text app; only minor critique I have is that if you want to copy/paste texts, you can only copy one text at a time. Other texting apps produce check boxes allowing you to select multiple texts at once, but that's my only criticism. Other than that, I like it. : )",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love the high level of customization options, honestly the main draw for me in a messenger app. Aside from that, all the basic needs are covered. No major issues or crashes so far. Only downside I have faced so far is apparently the app is a power hog. If I leave the app open my phone keeps flagging it as a power issue. Also I'm not fond of ads BUT I tend to forget about it anyway and I am aware there is a paid version.",4
com.p1.chompsms,LaLa,"Man I love this app but there are too many messages picked up by my stock app and missed by this one. (One was about a fraudulent charge on my credit card. Not something you wanna miss.) I highly doubt it's the interim carrier reason given several times because the stock app wouldn't get them either if that were the case. Any idea what else could be the cause? Can the app get ""too full"" and I need to delete more messages? Thanks.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Thomas Carrano,I like chomp for the group texting. You're able to text larger groups. However there has been a time or two when I send a group text sms (replies come only to you) & something went wrong. Everyone was getting the replies. I checked the settings & it was still on the correct setting. Seems to correct by deleting previous text. As if too many saved text create an over load. Note: I am not too tech savvy,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is exactly what I have been looking for... The past few days I have looked at so many text apps and I've had textra for a few years, but I wanted something more than colored bubbles and Jason sent me Textra's sister app...You can set different themes or make you own And you can choose the sound of sent messages. Love it. Editing my review and gave it 4 stars because you can't send videos like Textra or stock messaging.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Karyn,"Would be a 5 The customization choices are unparalleled with loads of themes plus ability to choose fonts, sizes, colours, etc. BUT I find it SO irritating to receive my messages in group texts TWICE (just to me, but STILL) that I'm deleting the app!

com.p1.chompsms,Judith Martin,It's a decent app for messaging. The glide typing is terrible. I'm constantly having to correct what it enters. I also hate that you can't personalize your friends a little easier. The method this has is pretty bizarre and difficult especially if you're new to smart phones. Make it easier!!,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love this app and so does everyone I recommend it to. Downside is, I just upgraded to the OnePlus 7 Pro and the app does not let you delete any messages. Emailed them and was recommended to use the sister app (Textra) but it is not near as awesome. Thought it was a one off problem but one of my customers (I work at T-Mobile) who uses the app too, did not work on hers either. Sounds like a OnePlus issue. I hope this gets fixed because I would hate to switch to a different app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"So i gave this app a 3 because my experience thus far has been good and bad. I enjoy the thorough customization it offers, but it could use an upgrade on the themes offered as well as being able to cusfomize individual chats. Also there have been times where i respond to a text when it pops up for a quick reply, but when i check back the text not only didnt send, its as if it was never written at all. So ill sit there waiting on a reply from them, but theyre actually waiting for mine.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Missy Rodriguez,"I have used Chomp for several years now and love it! It allows you to totally customize everything...from the backgrounds to the individual contacts ...even what color light blinks when you have a notification. I used chomp on my Galaxy S8+ for about 3 yrs until it stopped sending messages...but as soon as I upgraded to a Galaxy Note 20 ultra I downloaded the app and it works perfectly!

com.p1.chompsms,W R,"Use to really enjoy using this app. Go sms pro stopped working, so I downloaded chomp. This was a good app because I could set individual custom ringtones and colors. Now I set the ringtones and sometimes I can get one message with the set ringtones, others it automatically defaults to the system set ringtone. Very annoying. The app has been Uninstaller and reinstalled with no luck. Looking for a new app, sucks because I paid for this one.",2

You can basically customize everything including the font size, text color, bar color, etc. You can do so much with it! I've told everyone I know about it. Definitely the BEST text messaging app out there.",5
com.p1.chompsms,james rainey,"I like that it's called chomp lol. I like that it offers the scan for fonts feature, but it doesn't work super well for me and its hard to go thru the menu and find the fonts when they're sorted by app. I also wish I could customize the themes/colors of individual convos within a theme (helps tell people apart). But other than that it's one of the better customizable text apps I've tried.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Brandon B,I've loved Chomp for multiple years. It's my go to txt/MMS period! I'm very frustrated now bc I can't send mms with chomp anymore. Just all of a sudden I get the red exclamation point on any pic or gif I attempt to send. However when I switch from using chomp over to the native messaging app that came pre-installed I can send pics just fine. But chomp refuses to operate correctly. Please fix this or help me!,2
com.p1.chompsms,Joel,I loke the app but after my last update from AT&T it is glitchy. Sometimes the keyboard is transparent and you can see the text underneath. Sometimes the whole screen is blurry and unreadable. I have to lock and unlock my phone or it is like looking through a frosted window. I wish they had GIFS in addition to emojis and I wish you could send larger than 1 MB videos. In settings there is an option to send unlimited size but I'm still not able to send anything bigger than 1 MB,4
com.p1.chompsms,Len Philpot,"I bought Chomp Pro several years ago and have generally liked it. I'm not a heavy texter and don't need tons of interactive features but Chomp works fine for me. So why only three stars? As far as I can tell (which matches what I've seen from others) there's no way to blocklist group texts. You can't even manually blocklist the individual texts in a group message. Particularly during the height (depth?) of COVID lockdown, I was often dragged into irrelevant group texts that went on forever, and Chomp offered no way to deal with them. The absence of this long- and often-requested feature has me now evaluating other texting apps, despite otherwise generally liking Chomp.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Chomp needs to add new wallpapers more often. I've been having lots of trouble with the texting app I've been using for years & finally have found this one which also has wallpapers for the texting background. I don't like to use the stock sms app since it's just boring. I love the ability to have various wallpapers again. So far so good right now. Thanks.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Brandy Phillips,"I like that this app allows you to be as fun as you want. Personalized ring tones for each person who seems a message. Choose colors per person and chat. Add a colored dot next to unread texts of your color preferences. 1 thing u would add to this message app, would be to add a ring tone to group texts. But that's the only change I would make.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Just A Guy,"Been using the paid version for many years. I still prefer Chomp to most others, as it offers the most visual customization, especially compared to stock Google Messages. One issue that has continuously happened is every time I switch phones, Google messages works fine, but Chomp SMS messages are corrupted, out of order, and mislabeled. I've tried using Google data migration, as well as SMS backup and restore, and still, Chomp is corrupted. And Chomp as zero real support, so if something does pop up, there's no real help. I've tried several times.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Susan M.,I really like Chomp but it would be so much easier to see who is in a group text rather than having to look at a number when some of the group texts may have the same number and then having to figure out who's in the group. I've used Textra for years but decided to try Chomp and love the ability to customize so much. It would be more user friendly and a great feature to have group pics instead of numbers. PLEASE consider adding this feature to Chomp as you do with Textra!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Marilee Aschwanden,"It's now 2021 & I've left & come back after realizing this is the best text SMS app out there, the grass wasn't greener on the other side.

com.p1.chompsms,Brent Mote,"Maybe all my problems are self-inflicted, I just don't know enough about the app yet, but I have a few peeves that drop the Chomp experience down a couple of stars. First, once I select a photo to send I can't preview it to be sure it's the right one. Second, the quick reply window has a tendency to disappear before I'm ready to send and I don't know how to retrieve it. There's probably a way to do that but I haven't discovered it yet. And third, my gifs lose their animation making them stills.",3

I love the customization and quick compose/reply interface and those things make the little quirks worth it",5

Now chomp SMS has (AGAIN) started freezing up and closing in the middle of me trying to type a text or read a text. If a new text came thru the app completely closed when I would try to open it and read it. All of this after the newest update.

The support team is great and usually responds within 24 hours which is awesome. It's a solid app. Give it a try. Thanks Chomp Team",5
com.p1.chompsms,Brian Cayo,Wonderful! Only thing I'd add is the ability to read an entire text message when you arrow down to reply from the notification bar! In other words tapping the down arrow in upper right corner to reply to a text message should also expand the contents of the message also! Like I said great app...worth giving a try!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Fred H Fath,I recently switched to this app after using another for probably over 12 years. I did this for 3 main reasons. First this app is very customizable and similar to old app. Second due to the Sprint- T Mobile merger had issues sending MMS with old app. Third my old app's tech support wasn't the best. The suport I've received from Chomp has been top notch and fast response time. Glad I made the switch and can now send MMS again.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very customizable. Works well with my Samsung watch. The only problem I have is that it is slow to start up, I believe because it is loading up an ad each time.

No only do I have ability to add a subject heading for text, the app blends or syncs well with Andoid.

Overall the app is so user-friendly you don't need a ton of customer support, but it would be nice to see a website or something. UPDATE on Feb 1, 2022: After getting a quick response from customer service and getting my questions answered, I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 and I upgraded to the pro version of the app. This is the best app I've purchased in a long time!",5

Keep up the great work developers!!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Kevin Hopkins,"I have been using chomp for quite some time. I love the security aspects of the app. My only issue that I have is the MMS feature when large images are sent. Even when you have the settings selected ""Carrier send limit = Carrier has no limit"" selected, it still sends an error message and at times prevents other messages from the same message group from arriving. Aside from that issue, I would have given it a 5 star rating.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Shakthi Hammer,"Follow-up: Hi there, Thank you for the quick response. The magnifying glass does a search for all the contacts and doesn't allowtogo back to the list and have to search all over again. Other apps has one for each contact and highlights the words with an up-down arrow. Not sure if this can be added. Great experience overall. I would have given it 5 stars if this had a search option. Disappointed that it doesn't, or maybe I just can find it. Spent an obscene amount of time looking for old texts 🥺",4
com.p1.chompsms,John Ready,"I like it but it's not perfect. I switched to it for templates but they all appear in same type on same background - I have to look closely to spot where one ends and other begins. Also, if choosing a Contact only offers 1st number and only way to get msg sent to alternate number for that contact seems to be to type it manually. * Developer has suggested I try turning off ""Mobile only"" and that works but is deceptive* For all that it's better at handling my needs than some big name alternatives",4
com.p1.chompsms,Lisa Basalla,"I like the customizeable everything in this app. I ha e used this for years, but in the last few days I no longer see notifications on my lock screen, badge bar at the top or in my pull down notification drawer. If it was not for the notification on my Versa 4, I would miss all my texts. Please fix this.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Paul Dutton,"UPDATE!!! App has been updated and is working properly! I was using the program and it kicked me out and haven't been able to use it since, when trying to use it, it doesn't even load. This is the best most flexible and customizable sms app I've ever used! It's great and the support team is very prompt answering questions/concerns. Thank you for such a wonderful, awesome sms experience!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Howard Matthews,"Superior to the preinstalled app but I used to have different tones for texts and emails, now they're both the same one. EDIT: Looks like it's not this app but a system change, there were separate settings for each & now there's just one setting.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Allan Grossman,"I've been using Textra (Pro) for years and absolutely love it. Far better than the stock messaging app or any of the other 3rd party SMS apps I've tried (and that's a LOT 😉). Only just learned that Chomp was developed by the same folks as Textra and adds significantly more features and customization options for those of us who like to fiddle and make our apps ""our own"". I've been using it for several days now and it's GREAT. As good as Textra is, I'm enjoying Chomp even more.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Truth Or Consequences,I really love the app! The only problem is it's a little hard to follow sometimes.I would like to be able to back up my messages to a file without jumping through hoops I do like that you can send them to your email but I would like to be able to use the file and I'm not sure if you allow that to happen-also I have lost all of my messages a couple of times and I don't think it was anything I did so I wasn't too happy about that. I give you four stars because there's always room for improvement!!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Louise LMF,"I love this app for texting because you can customize colors, fonts, type size, images, etc. Definitely better than stock app. Individual notification sounds, blocking, etc help save time and cut down on interruptions.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Pastor Akin Bandele,"App stops working. I have used this app for almost a year to send group messages with no problems. But in the past 5 weeks, it stops working. I see a red ! by my message and no one receives my group messages. Please fix this bug; hope it's not your update causing my issue.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Kemeko M,"Update; it's been crashing a lot, might be because I have an older phone s10 from three years ago. But still a good app. It force closes when I send a message sometimes, seems to still send them properly. Use it on every phone! Love that I can custom it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,S Davi,"I like the app, and continue to use it because I seem to lose data with the Pixel 6 stock texting app. However, I would give it a perfect review IF: RE: text notification, if I don't mark as read I will get a second notification later. Also, regularly, I stop getting notified and have to click the ""test"" in settings or reboot to get it to work.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Cat Lincoln,"I absolutely love this app. Have had it for a few years now and always have it on a new phone, it is so customizable. I have reviewed it before a few years ago to criticize having no private box, which quite a lot of other users requested, but it is such a good app in other ways I will give up on that one and still give it 5 stars anyway.",5

I pay for unlimited 5G and have a phone which records 4k@60fps and takes gorgeous pics....but I can't f***Ing share them because they are ""too big for Facebook messenger"" and ""size limit reached"" in ChompSMS.

I'd be willing to pay again for ad-less, but it won't allow me because I already have the paid version. HATE THE ADS IN MY PAID VERSION!!!",1
com.p1.chompsms,David White,"I cannot get them to solve some long-standing + repeatable issues that made this app frustrating to use. Every time I email they ask for the same thing they asked for previously + that I did/sent. This is a waste of my time, not support. I am a paid user + like the app except for the problems and failure to use what I previously collected and sent.",1
com.p1.chompsms,E K,"I was just charged by Google for my annual Chomp Pro subscription and suddenly today I'm getting ads after updating. App is now asking a one time fee for Pro. Huh? If this is a new payment model then why did I just get charged for a ""subscription"" and did not get any notice of the change? No info online anywhere. Or is this just a bug? Very frustrating!",2
com.p1.chompsms,Renee G,Love the app!! Had it for years. But haven't been able to change themes lately. Keeps saying this app has a bug.. I've updated and reinstalled.. help. Thanks,4
com.p1.chompsms,Phil Stracchino,"Chomp SMS is my favorite SMS app. The killer feature it has that stock SMS apps don't have is not its extensive list of downloadable skins, though some of those are very cool and there's enough variety that almost anyone will be able to find one they like. The real killer feature is Chomp's ability to blacklist senders of SMS spam (or anyone else you don t want to ever speak to again) and simply reject their messages unseen. Sadly I recently discovered this does not work for MMS spam.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Richard Roosa,"Good, so far. Been using for about a month. Has not crashed or hung up. Be patient with setting individual ringtones, took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to achieve success. Once i got the hang of it it was smooth sailing from thereon out.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Donal Slemon,"Decided on this app from reading other reviews. It mostly does what it says on the box but I'm disappointed as most times I'm not getting SMS notifications that are sent from my bank, nor those that I use for other apps to confirm sign in with 2FA. Occasionally with the latter I receive if I hit resend on the app I'm signing in to. I don't have any of these issues as soon as I switch my default messaging back to my previous app. Phone is a new Redmi note 10 s running Android 11.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Bruce A,"If you click on the menu button, there are only a few options. And one of them is to entirely delete all of your messages. I can't think of a worse idea. But there is more. There is a backup/restore option. All this does is backup or restore your settings. Not your messages. So you might think you're safe, but you're not safe. This is a joke of an app. Try use your phone in the rain or after a few drinks and you're going to end up with a completely blank phone. It is verging on malware imo.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Judai Winchester,"I like this app and was a good replacement for the last sms app I used to use. However, there seems to be a bug in the system whenever I try to edit my theme (customization) and the app keep crashing. Can somebody please look into this and get this fixed? Thanks.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Shay S,"I usually love this app but now there are group text spammers. When I try to block via long hold I do not have option to block sender in a group text, only for a single person texting. And now there is a repeated error message pop up but that app is working fine.. Please fix and I'll upgrade review. UPDATE: and now weird numbers that end in a dash cannot be blocked either.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Bonnie Mulligan,"Good. Just one request: when the messages pop on the status bar, I'd like the option to mark read in addition to replying. It's cool that you can swipe the notification to mark read, but I want the notification to go away while leaving the message marked as unread or having the option to mark it read.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Tristin Young,"This is a feature rich program which allows great customization! There are a few features I miss from other programs that I have used in the past, however, this program meets many of the needs which I was seeking. It is well worth the time to customize to your heart's content.",5

com.p1.chompsms,Daniel S. Lewis,"Love this app. Went away for awhile, but found myself coming back again. Update: Still love the app but it's getting left behind. It has a lot of features sure, but now a days, you need protection as well. There is no encryption protection, plus no chat capabilities. With as long as this app has been around, you'd think they'd keep up with the times and keep their pro users happy? Hell, I'd even pay an upgrade fee if it wasn't outrageous, as I said I love the app, they just update to 2022.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Laurel,"Love how customizable this app is, and its not as glitchy as some text apps I've used. However, it would really benefit from 1) the ability to schedule texts and 2) an archive. Both of these features are available on Textra and Pulse.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Michelle Chin,"I do like this app very much, and have been using it for awhile now. However, lately I have become super annoyed with all the spam text that are overwhelming my space. These people are not on my contact list and I have not given them permission to text me. It seems the more I block, is the more spam I get. I feel I'm working too hard trying to rid myself of this aggravation. Please fix this.",4
com.p1.chompsms,PawsitiveThinking,I like this app alot. It's missing the fifth star because you cannot schedule multi recipient texts. You can schedule single recipients. So if you're planning something and need to text everyone you can't schedule it.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Jeffrey Jones,"I absolutely love this messaging app! I am a pro user and have been for a year or two now and totally support it. However, since the last update for some reason it's not sensing my pro status and it keeps telling me to pay for pro even though I already did. Other than that it is absolutely amazing Please fix this little bug thank you :-)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Noel Jones,"The stock app that came with my new android 11 phone was very dull. I wanted to add my own notification sound but would not get it to work. I searched for another app and came up with this one. I love the fact that you can customise the colours etc. and of course my ringtone. After using the app for a while, I got a message to tell me my add free trial was up, so I purchased the full version and am very happy with it. I am 73 years old and find everything about it easy for me. A happy bunny.",5

com.p1.chompsms,les wilkinson,"UPDATE I found chomp and decided to give it a try, as it's made by the Devs that make the excellent Textra SMS app🐯.. I am hooked, this app has just about everything you might need in a SMS / MMS app, and more. All I can say about the app, is it needs to be on your phone. The free version has ads, but they are hardly noticeable. But personally i would go for the paid version. You can't go wrong with Chomp SMS. Thanks developers, for all the work you have put into the app",5
com.p1.chompsms,Robert Jenkins,"I paid, and this app still connects to your ad server, and yahoo, to phone home. Askng me to contact you, when you know your app does this, is senseless. Just turn off tracking and spyware and ad connections if people pay. Simple.",1

com.p1.chompsms,David Ransom,"So far, it's been an excellent app. Much better than Pulse SMS that just STOPPED working on me one day??? My only suggestion for this app: Make deleting a message 'swipe-able'... instead of having to go thru the menu system to do so.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Izabela R,"I think it's a beautiful app, they way I've got my custom theme/colours I made. It doesn't take longer to load with a theme than without unlike another app. I'd add that it would be great if there was a search button to narrow down a search by colour or style. So far seems better than most messaging apps. I wish this app had a dot on the app showing I had an unread message though.",5

There are several themes you can choose from and customize, too. So many different ways to customize! And the customer service is great, too. I haven’t really noticed any ads, either. I highly recommend Chomp.",5

com.p1.chompsms,denise kiser,Absolutely the worse app on the market for texting. Half your messages will not go out and you will not know people are not receiving you messages. You will also fail to receive messages and sometimes the app will send a ton of messages to people all at once bc it didn't send them to begin with... Any positive review is a bot. Don't download this app!,1
com.p1.chompsms,Jo Susan Clapp,"I have had the Pro version of Chomp forever. I can't imagine using another messaging app. Chomp is infinitely customizable and feature rich. Don't even bother with its competitors. Chomp rocks them all. Two years since I last reviewed Chomp, and it's still the only messaging app for me. Okay, only 3 months after my last review of this excellent app, am I seeing pop-up ads in my paid Chomp? Say it ain't so, Joe, 'cause that would be a deal breaker for me.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nat Goodchild,"I have used Chomp fort at least 15 years. It works perfectly, sending and receiving SMS's without being intrusive and attempting to take over all messaging functions. I strongly recommend it as the best SMS app. I haven't had ads in the app, which is a bonus",5

Added May 4, 2022: Just wanted to add that the Chomp Team (Jason, Mandy, et al) continue to provide great customer service/technical support. All app developers should respond the way they do. I could list half a dozen apps where I emailed support and never got a response. The Chomp folks care about their customer base and it shows.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Natasha “ThatFreckleFaceLady” Cade-Batek,"Now looking for another SMS app. Attempted to talk to customer service (got Max) and they feel it's in their best interest to get smart and patronize their customers. No one should have to explain how to provide good customer service. 1st, apologize and be empathetic, even if you don't mean it, it's NOT hard. 2nd, you don't get smart, ESPECIALLY when someone explains the issue with the app interfering with a medical situation. It is not hard to be a good person, you can do better, so be better",1
com.p1.chompsms,Zyngarde,"A great customizable message app further improved with nova launcher. There are scarce few aspects I can't tune to my liking. I just wish there was a way to further shape the message bubbles and notification icon (the thing in the top bar, not app icon. Nova can fix the latter)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Asha M,I have Verizon wireless and my messages stop sending it's done this multiple times.

Very disappointing because it never did that before.",4

com.p1.chompsms,Mitchell Bradley-Williams,"Used to be very good been using for many years, but with recent updates messages are failing to send, when I submitted a report they insisted that it wasn't because of chomp despite describing the problem, but when I use stock messaging app texts are sent fine with no issues.. Shame",2
com.p1.chompsms,Steven N Picton (Steve),Been using this app for years. Love the customization and the quick responses from the support team. I really appreciate not having to use the proprietary apps that were included with my last 3 phones. Continuity between devices is wonderful.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Kirsten Kay,For the most part love it so far. I am having issues with NO Notification of receiving a message I have addressed in the app settings (and get a sound when I send) but still no notification of receipt.???? Only thing I don't like.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Kelley Le Beaux,I tried other texting apps because I didn't like the standard app on my phone & I kept coming back to Comp so decided to try it out. I love how you can customize the texting environment & it tells me if my messages were delivered or not. I would recommend this app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Kiara Petersen,"Favorite part of the app are the themes you can use, it makes it so much easier and fun to use. Only complaint about the app is that I don't get iOS emoji reactions. Which might just be a problem because I'm an Android user in a family of apple users and they are obsessed with text reactions lol. But it would be nice if Chomp could get reactions at some point.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jeremy Stocker,Samsung native messaging system received an up date that greatly hindered group messaging. So I switched to Chomp.

First of all, I am not an employee or paid person to do this review, I just thought that a lot of people are facing the same problems that I had faced...

YOU can customize everything from color to size, style.... All You won't know until you use it....",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sarah J,"Best messaging app I've used. It's simple, customisable, and I've never had issues with sending messages. Highly recommend. If I could make an improvement suggestion it'd be the search function. When you run a search and open an SMS from the results, it would be nice if hitting back once returned you to the search results, twice back to all SMS. Atm backing out of an SMS dismisses the search results. You have to retype the search multi times to view multi messages, which can get annoying.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Sarah Shirey,"Lots of customization and cute themes, plus you can make your own. Super easy to use. Ads on the free version are not intrusive or bothersome. I really like this app!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Pat Phillips,This sucks I don't see any reason to update to loose my colored notification. 8-11-22 Still using the app like the color options but needs better texting blocking. Getting so much spam. Not sure if adding it to block list is helping.,4

Overall I'd say this app works just as well as me previous messaging app, which came installed on my phone, butt is more feature rich.",5

Since I didn't get any news from you guys and Google Play didn't give me a refund, I've had to call my credit card and tell them that google and Chomp were frauding me and to stop the transaction and retreived my money. You guys should have taken care of your client, which you did not. I can't believe what just happened.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Sc G,unreliable. the app has crashed a couple of times and not realizing that it had not sent the text to put me in a position to not trust this app completely therefore making it unreliable will probably try something different again. Also pretty difficult just to change font size most other apps you can just pinch zoom on the message here you have to go three levels deep into the settings.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Carolyn Kimbrough,Scheduled messages through this app is the best feature ever!! Everyone I know gets a Happy Birthday text from me because I scheduled it ahead of time - and it repeats yearly! Truly wonderful - I'd give it 50 it of 10 if I could!!,5

com.p1.chompsms,GADGETS & MACHINES,Overall good. I prefer this over default sms app because it gives me option to delete in the pop up view. This helps to thrash and block unwanted messages in a single go.,5
com.p1.chompsms,David Cook,"This app shows ALL your text when writing, unlike the Google app, which is what I needed. Tried various themes to get the best contrast. Now outgoing texts are very visible white on black, but incoming texts not quite so clear white on blue, and numbers are harder to see. There are many themes to choose, so there may be a better one. I don't think you can preview them, so it's trial and error. Text messages come up on the home screen, which I like.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Trang Pham,"I had to recently switch from Textra, which I have loved and used for years, due to issues I was having with the app. I'm very happy with Chomp. You can customize everything, outside of the actual icon, which you can't change the colour of like Textra (you should be able to though!). I hated seeing the ads at the top of your msgs, so I upgraded. It was annoying, very annoying, so if you do not want to pay a small fee, you might want to reconsider. It's well worth the small fee though!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great app, have been using it for years. However, it is annoying now when repeatedly the last drafted message and recipient appear each time I want to send a new message. It is sooo tedious to have to edit and delete the recipient, as well as the text message. Others I know have the same problem using this app too. Please sort out this bug. I was hoping that it would be noticed and resolved long before now, but in the end I have resorted to having to write a review to get some attention to this problem. If it isn't changed soon, I'll simply have to change app.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Shayne Smith,"Was having many issues with Messages and found no fix. Found Chomp and gave it a shot. Haven't had any issues in the month I've used it. Sends pictures and texts. Only downside is that after a free trial, you get ads. Ads show up as a new conversation so they're easy to ignore. If that's all I have to deal with to get a functioning messaging app, I'm in.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Chip Hansen,"So, I was having issues with Messages, the app that came with my phone. The most serious were crashing the phone and sucking extraordinary amounts of power. There are many different msg apps to choose from. This one was rated well on many review sites so I tried it. Works like a charm. No issues. Integration with contacts and current conversations was seamless. Highly recommend",5
com.p1.chompsms,E. G.,"Great app, very customisable, easy on the eye, with quite a few useful features, like scheduled messages or blacklisting. I do miss an option to copy a selected part of a message though, its lack has severely slowed down my workflow recently. Regarding eye candy, an option to swap colours of incoming and outgoing messages while editing a theme would be helpful. Still, it's the best messaging app I've used. Thanks. EDIT: It's been almost 2 years and there's still no option to copy a part of text.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Anne MacAusland,"A whole lot better than the crummy messaging app that came with my phone. Just a little glitchy sometimes for example when I want to send a particular picture and I select the correct one, it generates another picture and attaches that to the message. And I have two contacts that for whatever reason will not pop up when I start to type their name on the search bar. But really the app itself works great",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very good app. Fast and stable. Used it for years, always better than stock text messaging apps, always reliable. Small glitch that's followed me last few phones: whenever I send a photo to someone, if I should click on that photo after its sent to view it, it wont expand, I'll just get a black screen. I have to click and hold and choose view photo to make it expand..this glitch will go away after 5-10 minutes and I'll be able to click normally..just a small thing.",5
com.p1.chompsms,James Field,"I've been using ChompSMS for years - since my Sony Ericsson X10i. Every now & again (usually when I change phones) I try the stock messaging app, but invariably it isn't as good as Chomp, so I come back. Last time I changed phone, Chomp seemed to stop working properly. I messaged the developer and got a quick response which fixed the problem straight away (just an Android setting I haven't seen before). All in all, I can't fault the app, especially since they fixed the slightly annoying issue where the advert would pop up where your top message was a moment before, leading to accidental advert taps - they've replaced that with a spacer now, so no more accidental taps.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using Chomp for years because it gives me great control over the appearance of the screen; I'm really picky about colours and such. The only thing missing, in my opinion, is per-contact notification sounds; I have to use another app to provide those. UPDATE: thanks to the developer for promptly pointing out that it is indeed possible to set per-contact notifications! I've upgraded my rating to 5 stars.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Micah M,"Love the app. Just about every aspect is customisable, the ads aren't intrusive, and it always works. Only issue I have is when searching sms, if you open a msg then go back it takes you out of the search altogether. I have to type my search in again & again to go through multiple sms. Seems like you should hit back once to return to the search results, and a second time to return to all sms. It's extremely inconvenient right now.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jonathan Webb,"Good. It just works. Been using it for many years. I don't really know about the ""feature rich"" aspect- I chose colours for the messages and I preferred the layout iver the stock version that came on my phone.

However, for the past 48 hours I've been having issues receiving texts. Every couple hours, I need to revert back to the default messages app to receive new texts, otherwise they don't come through.

When I change my outgoing and incoming text 'font' to Italic, regardless of which bubble I pick, the last character in the text gets cut in half. Like it can't fit it all in the bubble. Question marks are particularly bad. The whole top half of the question marks gets cut off. When I switch to standard non italic characters, the problem goes away.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Len Jones,I found that the app work very well. There was a learning curve with it. but that is expected with every app that you use for the first time. What I like the most. There is a delay timer that gives you time to check your message for mistakes before sending. I program mine for five seconds. Also the home screen can be customized. In all it is a very good app. I purchased the app after a while for $3.95 I think. Here's hoping they don't screw up the app by making too many changes.,5

Thank you so much to the devs!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Karin Lualhati,I like the appearance of the app but can you improve on the following: 1. Notification. When I received a new message the notification will pop up in the middle of the screen and cover half of the screen. It also stops my videos. Can you make the notifications pop up at the top and disappear in seconds. 2. Search. I can only search my contacts name. I can't search from the conversation.,4

Still like it, the quick notification is the best one I've seen so far. Obviously chomp has been update and works more reliable now, I'll stick with it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sam T,"It's 5 stars when it works but recently I've been missing texts and there maybe something that's incompatible with my phone,had to default back to the stock sms ☹️ but the guys at chomp are hopefully sorting this for me. When it worked there's lots of functionality, I'll miss the scheduled text function and delay send, essential for that damned auto-correct! Lots of themes and emojis to choose from.",4

com.p1.chompsms,Debbie Stark,I love this app! So many oprions and works very smoothly!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Odif,Chomp is the best I've found. I've tried others and found only more reasons to stay with Chomp. The Chomp team provides great support when asked. Thank you for a great app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Peter Wade,I installed this as I couldn't send anything over 300kb but now I'm using chomp I can't send any pics at all. I can't find anyway of asking chomp for help. Going back to my old MMS. Wasted my money.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Charles H Zerafa,"Best messenger ever, I tried a lot of messengers and most had something that I did not like. Chomp chomps the rest to bits. I love the theming as well makes the app look pleasing to the eye. Thank you Chomp team.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've used Chomp for 4 years now. Very happy with it. Quite solid. Main reason I went with it was for the pop up on the lock screen. Love being able to reply without unlocking. I had a slight issue in moving to a Galaxy S9 recently where the pop up stopped working, but an uninstall/reinstall fixed things back up. The only thing I wish it had was the option to swipe delete conversations. The long press/delete thing will always annoy me when everything else I use is a swipe to delete.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Graham Webber,"Have had this for a month now. Tried it because my old app wasn't showing callers name, just phone numbers, and i couldn't find a way to fix it. This app is really good, lots of features, lots of tweaks that can be made to improve the overall experience (not that the default needs improvement). I just paid my $3.95 to update to the pro version because it's a great. app and the authors deserve reward for a job well done. I'd give 10 stars if it were possible :)",5

One is that I'm having issues with my carrier converting long texts to MMS lately so when I did the split text option to get around it, it even split my short texts just because I added emojis. Also I've had messaging delays even tho the no delay option is selected. Probably due to my carrier but you know, still worth mentioning. Features seem good overall tho.",3

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"EDIT: thanks for the reply! I've also noticed that chomp no longer shows information on my home screen when I receive a message when it is locked (it used to show the contact and a few words of the message). it possible that we will get a feature like Samsung's Chat Type? So that we can use data to see when messages are read and when contacts are typing? Would be great to finally have this, I'd hate to switch to the stock sms.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Willie B. Hardigan,"I really like it. To be totally honest, I like the functionality of Google Messages a bit more but the trade off is that their app gets huge. The cache grows to multiple gigs. But I really do like Chomp too. I wish it did more to automatically accommodate attachments, even if that means compressing even more to ensure it fits within the confines.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Stephanie Nugent,No matter what I do there is no notification sound when texts come through. The most basic thing a texting app should do is make a sound when you receive a message. Update: after deleting and redownloading the app a second time the notifications are now working. Very pleased with the app overall.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Charlie G.,Can't get audio notificatios to work???,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like this app. I don't have the MMS issue like with the ""default"" texting app - it actually lets me respond to group MMS messages without breaking them. One thing the ""default"" texting app did that this doesn't is when i am sharing an image or sharing a website externally into the app and i type someone's name, it normally brings up the conversation, which is helpful. This one doesn't do that, but it's not a dealbreaker.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Gene Foley,"A fairly good app. Better than most. Needs better gifs, emojis Last word of text too close to send button. Results in accidentally sending before ready.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've tried many sms apps and this is one of the best. Highly customisable, attractive, smooth and clean. Well worth buying the paid-for ad-free version. The only problem is that sending a message to multiple people at once becomes an absolute mess. This is a big problem for me. I would love it if this could be worked on. The second thing I would like to see is to be able to lock an entire conversation instead of just one message.",4

Had a couple of options I could not work out so contacted support and within 24 hours I had 2 emails from her explaining in easy laymens terms what to do to rectify my problem caused by me being thick. Not a problem at chomp’s end. There are so many amazing settings available for the user to configure to their own liking and it is fun doing it as well. I thoroughly recommend this great app to everyone so try it, you will not be disappointed",5
com.p1.chompsms,Tammy S,I have been using Chomp for many years and just recently purchased it to get rid of annoying ads that were texts on top of my list. It's worth the few bucks to have full use of this app. Buy it! You won't be disappointed. Edit: I hope the devs see this. Is there an option to record small audio voice files via Chomp and send via text???,5
com.p1.chompsms,Asaf Razaq,The app UI was phenomenal but some of my messages didn't get through. Initially I didnt think it was chomp that was the issue but when I reverets back to default message app I had no issue. A good example of this is my credit card verification codes- with chomp I had to ask them to resend the message a few times every time but with default it came through staright away.,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Really great SMS app. Highly customisable and easy to set up. Only suggestion would be on the delay to send feature - if the devs can add the function to send if you're happy with what's being sent without waiting and without turning the feature off to have it work this way (similar to textra). Other than that, worth the download and worth the small fee to go to pro version 😊👍",5
com.p1.chompsms,Agathos Daimon,"Edit. Added an extra star for the customer service unfortunately none of the suggested fixes work. Same goes for Textra. Was really looking forward to this after finally deciding to ditch the annoying Google messages, but incoming texts don't arrive while this is set as default app. All permissions are on but nothing. Sending is fine but cannot receive. Texts arrive as soon as I set the default app back to Google. Emailed support, awaiting response but currently unusable.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very simple but very efficient messaging app, I've tried alot of different apps but I chose to stick with this one because of ease of use. Only issue I have so far is that messages that failed to send are not indicated in the conversation list, nor is there a notification informing me that the message was not sent.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Shane Barratt,This app is really easy to use. Seems to work fine. My only gripe is that I would like to see a delete next to the reply in the drop down notification as I dont like the big splash one that you can activate on either the home or lock screens. But overall very happy with this better than stock app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great SMS app. Can automatically detect phone numbers and match them against entries in the phone book. However this feature should be improved that even before sending a message, it has to be functional. Great app indeed. Just add a textual button for composing new messages for accessibility with screen-readers.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Thread Bomb,"I can't send MMS with this app (on Moto G7). There is a message to ""check APN settings and then retry"". There is no access to APN settings in the app (latest version), and no advice as to what to do with the APN settings. From googling I have done, this issue is seven years old and they still haven't bothered to fix it! If you only want to send text, Chomp is fine. For MMS, it is hopeless and you are better off using the stock Messages app. EDIT: I emailed help as advised, and they said there is no fix except to use another app for sending images. BTW, I also can't send texts to email addresses. So if you have a Moto g7, look for a different app.",1

User interface is outdated and has never improved. I recently had to use default sms app on new phone and it's far more friendly and versatile. Looking for something new now.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Barbara F Underwood,"I have used ChompSMS text app for a long time & am a Pro user. I love it & use several of its special unique features like the delay send. I like that I can do a last second look as my text is going & decide if I want to stop it or not. And being able to schedule a text for another day is great. My kids have convinced me to try other text apps but I always come back to Chomp! It's my favorite! And if you ever have a problem, their tech support really rocks.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"As always Chomp SMS is an excellent app. The SEARCH function can be improved. After a search and being presented with multiple search result SMSs, CHOMP SMS does not return you to the searched results screen after viewing one of the search-resulted-SMSs, but takes you back to all (unfiltered) SMSs. Would welcome a delete multiple function to delete multiple SMSs WITHIN the search results.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love this messaging app. Super customizable and light-weight! 😊 But it lacks a private inbox feature. If the developers could add it, together with a dummy notification that's also accessible for free, that would be perfect! 👌 And I don't have to find another messaging app. 😉",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"By far, the sleekest looking of all the texting apps. Very nice to look at and easy to navigate. But I was forced to delete it once I discovered that there is no mute option. No mute option, seriously? Looking forward to reinstalling once your developers add a mute option.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Nani Martinez,"LOVE this app. Most important, re: compatibility: I have a Samsung Note20 Ultra, have been using Chomp for about 3+ wks, & I haven't experienced ANY issues. Totally stable! Now the fun stuff. I've been looking for a texting app that I could customize & change up as I wanted--whether it be by season, color, holiday, etc. This has so many templates that I can customize & make more my own. Oh, & there are lots of different chat settings too! 😀",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Been a premium user for a long time, I really like this app. I do have a question though - somehow my Zedge notification sound isn't applying to Chomp. I changed my phone's master sound settings to use a Zedge notification sound, but for some reason, Chomp is still using a factory sound instead. I do have Chomp set as my default messaging app - any ideas what I can do to get the Zedge sound linked to my Chomp notifications?? Thanks!",5
com.p1.chompsms,VinnyBoy Wo,"Love it. It's been stable and completely reliable. I wasn't happy with the stock message app that came on my phone. I did some research and found a few apps that I wanted to try. FB Messenger was too heavy for my everyday needs and also alerted people that I was ""available"" as soon as I got on. Others had the features I wanted, but were full of ads. ChompSMS was the best of all worlds.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Shawn Deiger,"The latest update sucks for text to speech. Periods get a space before them. Random words get capitalized. The hints for spell check disappeared.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Samsung galaxy 8+ stock. Works great. 5 stars of it had auto response when driving with muted notification sound like Message+. Had to stop using that one because they stopped sending my pictures. Enhancement requests. Need to be able to mute MMS and need pop up response for MMS. It's been driving me crazy why I get some pop ups and not other pop ups. But I finally realized it's the MMS messages aren't popping up.,4

com.p1.chompsms,Sarah Hopkins,"I do love this app especially because I'm able to customise it so much too. However the past few days I've noticed that the delivery confirmation hasn't been working? While the messages are saying ""..."" (Pending) people are able to reply so they're obviously getting my texts but it's still unreliable. A message to my mother is still pending and I know she's not received it I had to send her a WhatsApp message. Apart from that niggle it's perfect.",4

Few years ago when I was using you guys when I was in a conversation I can TV the one entry I don't want, but after the main screen with several people with others I cannot delete the entry that I sent to multiple people I still cannot do that. To the point my hand was hurting and I was forced to uninstall this particular app why can't you guys do anything right we don't want to see anything that we already sent.",2

I don't want to go back to the default messenger, but I need one that I can add to the main navigation.

com.p1.chompsms,Charlene Y Ridley (Char),It was ok just not what I'm looking for. Also tried Textra. Both want back up all of my old messages. I'm holding on to those messages because they belonged to someone very close to me. I had mood messages and it was wonderful but I think they gave up on it or something. Both of your apps are set up beautifully. I paid 1.99 a month for mood. And don't want to have to pay anymore just to have those messages that mean the world to me. Anyways thanks for that recommendation.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Susan Saldana,"OMG! I love this app. The SMS app that came with my cell phone was terrible. If I wanted to text photos I had to text them one at a time. And yet sometimes even 1 photo could be to large to text. It was such a pain. Chomp is so much better. I texted like 7 photos using my Chomp App. Had no problem! Thank you so much for this app, you hit a home run.",5

Miss you Chomp but you and my phone don't like each other.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Camemom,"No app is perfect - this one is not bad. Has most features expected and has some pretty themes. I will say this - when there are issues, support is responsive and helpful. That makes up for shortcomings which have so far been minor during my usage (about 2 years now).",3

Fave feature is the timer that turns a 3am text into a 9am text. I would love this app for that reason alone. But I also adore the fully customizable bubbles, colors/themes, and ability to blacklist. This app has never given me issues, keeping up with ever newer phones and OS they run. Highly recommend to all.",5

Also, now the app will get into a crash cycle where you have to force stop:-(",2

Finally figured out it was a cleaner app blocking all notifications.... but liked chomp so much decided to keep using it.

com.p1.chompsms,Gaea Egan,"I paid to be a pro user and kind of wish I hadn't. I like the customization, but it's missing key features like organizing unknown at top and blacklisting.

com.p1.chompsms,Trevor Willocks,"Wanted an app to display a notification dot if I still had unread texts after opening some, it does that not a problem. I would forget or miss texts after receiving several and only having time to reply to a couple, the other unread would be forgotten with nothing there to remind me. It does everything else I'd want from a SMS app. The ads aren't intrusive but I'll probably now pay for their removal. The only improvement would be to display the number of unread messages in the notification dot.",5
com.p1.chompsms,SuRGe 13,I was looking for an alternative to textra because i was having problems sending mms. This app runs great and very customizable. ONE HUGE PROBLEM tho.

com.p1.chompsms,Randi Ormsby,Something's missing...I have no option to change the color of the notification icon. Can you fix it please. I've tried uninstalling then install again. Didn't work.

I don't need the advanced features and this app's free version is enough for me. I have been using this app for over a month now and It is good. I just wish there were more material design themes in the free version itself. I have no qualms about the features of the free version as it satifies all of my needs. It just feels as though there is something missing from the free version and I just am not able to put my finger on it. Overall, a good app for daily requirements.",4

com.p1.chompsms,Sarah W,I've been using Chomp for several weeks now. I was looking for an alternative for the messaging app installed on my phone and decided to give Chomp a try. It is easy to use and works great. When the ad-free period expired I decided to pay the nominal fee for removing the ads. While the ad banner isn't obtrusive I wanted to support the developers and pay the small fee for the upgrade.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Tristan Johnson,this is overall a very well designed app. i like the feature to change the emoji style to ios style emojis. however i am not particularly fond of the blocky nature of the text-message boxes. the option to change the appearance to a sleeker more modern look would greatly increase the user experience.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Mitch E. Pu,"Thank you. After many years with ***** SMS, I am finding Chomp the most delightful SMS app I have ever come across. It works flawlessly, and the endless choices of customizations keep me entertained all day long (or at least when I'm not working) 😬. I don't have any enhancement requests, everything works as it should and then some. Just keep it up. Chomp is a game changer.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Danajo Mello,I love love love Chomp! I have used it for almost 7 years now for all I do. It's easy to use and have great themes you can download and change out a long with different fonts also. You can back up all very easy. I haven't had any problems using this app! Keep up the good work Chomp your my favorite....just saying,5
com.p1.chompsms,John Shockey,Definitely a good app. I really like where you can delay sending your text up to 5 seconds. Too many times I accidentally hit send or needed to change something and too late stopping it with the default app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Shirley Hawley,I loved this until last week. I have sent message that are not received! Shows they are pending. Has there been issues? I tried again and it again went into pending my messages! I like the app but it is frustrating when messages are not send or received.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Julie James,"I've been using Chomp for many years and have never felt the need to experiment with others. It has everything I need, and I've even installed on family members' phones when they need help setting up. I had no problem paying for the pro version as it's something I use all day every day. Now when I look at others' conversation screens it just looks wrong. Chomp just feels right for me.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"It doesn't receive all of my text messages. About once a week, someone will ask why I didn't reply and show me their phone with the text to me. I opened the default texting app, and the missing texts were on it, but not on Chomp. It's literally the only job of this app and it can't do it correctly.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Tom Conte,Had to remove Chomp. Ate up most of the rest of my storage space. Only had 7 gigs free. Upon removing the app and going back to the Android messaging app I now have 17 gigs free. All my messages carried over so it wasn't the messages taking up the space. I went from 71% used space to 86% in one week after some investigation I found it was chomp taking a bite out of my storage. Upon removing I have 68% of my storage used. Cannot recommend after experiencing this.,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"TL;DR: Bland design, no ""message sending"" indicator, ghost error notification that wouldn't go away. I have tried most messenger apps, and I recommend Pulse - hands down the best. Compared to what else is out there, ChompSMS is subpar at best. I left Samsung's messenger because I don't appreciate them making copies of every text I send (if you don't believe me, read the EULA). There are already enough people spying on us Americans, last thing I need is yet another corporate spy. So for years I used GoSMS. Eventually, ads got out of control and I looked for an alternative. I used Chomp for about two weeks. I did not like how there is no real indicator of a pending text being sent. I live in an area with poor service, and an indicator is crucial. Uniform colors also leave messages wanting more, with the same bland teal and grey regardless of the person you're talking to. Finally, and most importantly, is the ""Failed to send MMS. Retry?"" Message that plagued me constantly. Despite all of my MMS going through, being resent when it didn't, etc., This message was a constant companion. I went as far as going back years in my messages looking for an old MMS message that had never sent but didn't find anything. I could not find any solutions to this online, so I decided to move on. Currently, the best SMS/MMS app out there is Pulse. Highly recommend you give that a try",2

com.p1.chompsms,Sandra Jennings,It works well with my phone security. The app that came with my phone didn't work from day 1. The app i chose to replace it fought with my security. The next app had security measures built in. Too much security! Chomp works well. I did know that i was on a free trial & was surprised to find that out after a month. But i liked it enough to pay $2.99 for no ads.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I used his app happily for about 3 years and that is the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1. Lately there has been a pop up message every time I open it saying ""Amazon fetch add called"". I don't have Amazon apps so I wans't sure where it was coming from at first. After multiple emails with multiple support people (steps including emptying the cache, uninstalling, powering down and reinstalling the app from a specific link about 5 times) the issue was unable to be resolved. As a result I had to uninstall the app permanently as I am unwilling to deal with the annoying message despite my liking of the customizability of the app.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Evrim Icoz,"They're a bunch of things that could have been much better with this app and that's also why I'm deleting it soon. A) when Searching for a contact in the app and clicking on the name, it doesn't show previous messages b) international characters fail ü, ö, ñ - not sure why c) you can't create a nickname for group messages, d) you can't make a message as unread so it's easy to lose track",3

com.p1.chompsms,skye knight,"I started using CHOMP because my Handcent NEXT SMS began acting strange. Handcent wouldn't allow me to send or receive any text messages so I began to look for a replacement text app. With HANDCENT NEXT SMS, I was accustomed to being able to schedule future texts, personalize each contact notification tune, personalize the app with different schemes, fonts, and wallpapers. CHOMP had stopped working after two weeks. I'm going back to HANDCENT NEXT SMS!!!",3
com.p1.chompsms,Kris Furcolow,"I'll say I'm still in the adjustment period (aka learning) so I'm sure this app does things I don't know about yet. I like Chomp so far. It seems very similar to my previous app (which disappeared). The only thing it doesn't do, (or I haven't figured it how to do it) is create a group chat so I can't push one contact button & reach out to a whole group. I can send texts to a group, but if that text chain gets deleted I think I need to add each person to a text again. Otherwise, so far so good!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Tia Prince,"I loved this app and wanted to give it a chance however I switched back to the default app and there were so many messages there that weren't delivered in Chomp. I'm beyond upset because some of those were very important and I've accused people of not returning texts when they actually did! My son texted me and I responded immediately. I proceeded to freak out on him for not responding back, wouldn't ya know, he never got it! I would never recommend this app. God forbid there was an EMERGENCY!!!",1
com.p1.chompsms,Rob,"Great experience with this app, been using Chomp for a little while and it does all I need it to do. I came from Textra only to trial Chomp out for a bit, Textra was also an excellent app and I have nothing negative to say about it Will I stay with Chomp? Or go back to Textra? For me it's a very difficult choice but no matter what it's always nice to have a backup SMS app that you know you can rely on.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Anon Ymous,Love it! Had to find an alternative after my Android Messages started having issues. Loved Chomp so much I bought the Pro version. Update: I requested tech support to help me understand how to do some customizing of the app. Their response was prompt and professional. They understood exactly what I was asking and solved my confusion efficiently.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Really a great messaging app withinor flaws and super smooth... It doesnt delay often or at all... It is easy to navigate and change the optiins for each person but I would like to have a media option for each sms thread where you can see all media sent by each person or thread and maybe a option to lock only certain texts and have the rest accessible with a password just a opinion but overall 4.7 Stars,4
com.p1.chompsms,Joel,I wish I could enlarge the text it's too small and may force me to use a different program. My screen text size on my phone is at its largest so I can't increase it that way. Also I don't see an option to use my video camera from within a message. Also the lack of being able to archive something is annoying as well.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Laurence Munthali,Very good app for messaging. Flexible and easy to use. It has lots of custom options. But would you please add an option of renaming the group chat? And please it's so annoying seeing the same message being listed repeatedly in group chat conversation according to the number of contacts in it..,4
com.p1.chompsms,The McDaniels,This app is amazing and completely solved my mms problems! I have AT&T plus I live out in the country so I live on wifi calling and texting. A few months ago I was unable to receive any mms texts/gifs. AT&T told me I could only receive mms on cell data and could no longer get them on wifi. This app has changed that...I get all my texts now. The colors and themes are an added bonus. Thanks Chomp Team!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Gerry Darnton,Use it instead of my stock app on my Samsung. Really easy to use with lots of customization options. First class.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Brytt Blatter,"Love it! Customization is incredible and a one time payment for premium! With Go sms, you'd have $30 yearly, but chomp is $3 flat.

People will randomly get images sometimes in the middle of the night but it doesn't send.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Zaza Computer,"Bought this app. Everything was fine until last updates. Now I can't receive messages at all. Only if I have opened thread with specific person, with whom I'm chatting. I don't receive any other messages. If i have 2 conversations I'm definitely missing one of them. Very inconvenient.

com.p1.chompsms,Chris Peller,Chomp has been everything they claimed it would be and everything I wanted it to be. It's a top notch messaging app. I have no complaints and I'm so glad I tried it.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"It's a great message app, hands down. The only thing I can't figure out is when I set my carrier limit to ""carrier has no limit"", it still won't send larger files.

com.p1.chompsms,Nitrode Twofiftysix,"Works mostly ok (despite some annoying quirks) for a couple weeks, then starts in with the ads and ransom (at which point it also ""forgets"" your contact list info and only gives you phone numbers instead of names).

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Impossible, suddenly, to delete full discussion, the application freezes. As it came after many problems for which the Support tried to help, i finally uninstalled it and am now using another one. Oneplus 5T, android 9 last release. I have been using chompsms for about 2 years. Probably problem comes when i block internet traffic for chompsms, but their intrusive adverts are not acceptable. Using NextSMS, no problem at all!!!",1
com.p1.chompsms,Molly R,I don't always get texts and people don't always get mine!!! It has caused a lot of issues!!,2
com.p1.chompsms,Bryce Boyer,"Used for years, even got premium but switching out to another app... Unfortunately Chomp has one fatal flaw that drives me nuts... The media management for sent/received media is so incredibly clunky it reminds me of Android 3.0! Group chats have issues with showing the text convo preview, pictures and audio clips don't show up, they can't play at all usually and one will play when playing a dif clip, oh and you can't control them either. This is a huge downgraded player in contrast to most apps",2
com.p1.chompsms,Shy Turner,"wasn't able to use Chomp for a few months due to some weird error, just started back being able to use it, I think it was an update y'all put out, but would be nice to see themes with different customization something like the ones with the Handcent sms app and be able to send short videos without getting a error message, my carrier doesn't have a mms limit but even a 2 second video won't send",3
com.p1.chompsms,Duke Lane,"That said, the customization on a per-user basis is particularly useful and the primary reason I'd used the other product: I like knowing if it's a text message I can ignore or need to read. HIGH PRIORITY FEATURE I'd like to see added is the ability to send v-cards, which is not supported (I've got to temporarily make another app the default SMS to do so): being able to ""give out business cards"" is important to everyone in business or in sales. Even the chintzy native Samsung G10 app sends VCF!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Chimene Pelletier,"Wonderful messaging app, love the customization options, that I can pin conversions to the top, and especially the easy reply pop-ups so I don't have to go into the app at all to respond to a text. Definitely worth getting the paid version, though the ads on the free version are incredibly low key and not intrusive at all. Great work guys 👌",5
com.p1.chompsms,Dahlia Marcano,"Greatttttt appp! My fav text app. My only issue (and its a pretty big eye sore on the Conversations list screen) is that you dont show any contact picture for a group text convo. Every other app shows a combo of all 3 or 4 ppls pics in the convo. Some show a collage of all ppl's pics, others shrink each pic tiny and fit all into the contact pic on the conversation list, but you just leave it completely empty. So it would be nice to see contact pictures for group texts on the Conversations List.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,It works good and i do like it. but I went with this app hoping it would have a private password so my messages could not be read with out the password. but when I get a new message notification you can read the new message with out unlocking the app. all you have to do is pull down on the notification at the top. but if you tap to open the message you have to draw the password to open.Hope they can fix it.,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very good with scheduled text messages, UI, customization and lack of lag. If the app were able to tell you the exact time you received a message when your phone was off/having no signal after an extended amount of time, the app would be perfect.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have to say that I'm saddened because I may have to uninstall this app. It seems there some issue receiving texts from iPhone inadvertently. Instead you get ""message can't be found"", but if you go back to stock app, the message will be there. The major concern I have is that I didn't receive the medical alert text from my elderly mother in law. Thankfully she was only texting her unit. Folks BEWARE if you depend on texts for medical emergencies, etc. So far support is no help at all.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Greg Buff,I already upgraded to pro once. Ads are back. How many times do you want my money???,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,🍰Like it says. It's delicious. I've been using for several years. At first because it was one of the only texting apps that enabled you to manually add your APN settings which helped me resolve not getting my texts on unlocked phones. Paid a couple bucks in 2015 and is a must have to this day on every phone. Thank you Devs for a great and reliable app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is a great and responsive texting app with many granular settings and features that allow a depth of customization and personalization that should fit just about anyone's tastes. Many themes to download, as well as the ability to build your own. Chomp SMS is fun to use!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Made with gusto! Or it wouldn't be so dam good! The developers are very responsive. This app has everything you could need and more. The customisable layout is superb. Very smooth, well designed app with great control and settings. I highly recommend using Chomp!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nicholas Giaquinto,I see that it is designed by the people who created Textra which is an awesome message app what I love about chomp is that it is highly customizable as well especially with font colors so it kind of plays off of what textra doesn't have if you are a textra user. The only reason why I gave it four stars and I will give it five stars is it is not as detailed as I think it could be there is no heads up notification. And there is no black send box.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Jessica Lynn,"It's good. Just wish it gave you the option to read full text when I quick reply. The main reason for quick reply is so we don't have to open full app to text them, but even though It says I can do a quick reply, but it won't let me. I have to still open full app to see full text.",4

com.p1.chompsms,Sharon West,"Unreliable. Sometimes it works but mostly it doesn't. I have tried un-installing and reinstalling, rebooting, cussing...nothing works! It does not tell me that the message was not or could not be sent, nor do I get a notification when I receive a message. .",1
com.p1.chompsms,Jessica Estrin,"The customization is great - especially the easiest when it comes to assigning different tones, vibrations and colors to important people in my life! I do wish the ads weren't such a distraction - the constant flashing is tough when you're typing a message.",4

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"*[UPDATE] Thanks for the reply, I've updated the review!* Tried several messaging apps already, last one got super bloated and buggy after updates so had to switch. Chomp is nice because it seems quick and lightweight, but I wish the theme allowed color customization for individual contacts too, so like changing their conversationg bubble color, etc.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"When I returned to Android, this was the first app I installed. Have missed it terribly! Aesthetically pleasing and fully customisable. Upgraded to ditch the ads a few years back and thankfully this was still recognised after years of being lost in the abyss that is iOS. 😊",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sol Chapeau,"Only military uses 24 hour clock. I have had 2 stock ROMs that had an option for 24 hour clock, in 2011. Literally no stock or custom ROM has had that option in a decade. So please keep lying to your audience saying that the user chose an option, that has not existed for 9 years. Edit: What is ""choosen""?

com.p1.chompsms,George Abraham,Used to like this app but I am looking for something to replace it. Why? 1. I am not getting all my messages in Chomp when the stock Samsung app gets them just fine (which they keep telling me is an RCS issue that only works with Google yet it works with Samsung's stock app). 2. Backup and restore now uses Google Backup which simply doesn't work on my new device...now I have no means of transferring my themes and settings. Very disappointed.,1

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Best choice for those who need templates and signature support. Chomp is an excellent stable texting app. For small business use, the templates and signature feature is a life saver. Customers typically ask the same Questions over and over again. Having the answers to these already to go in a template is a massive time saver. Product info, payment terms, directions to the shop location, etc. Having a signature line with the company name, is useful so the customer knows who is responding.",5

com.p1.chompsms,Michael Nowacki,"Was satisfied with it after switching from the default Android app, for which I could NOT control the notifications or notifications volume. But I found duplicate chats, the exact same 2 other contacts in separate chats that even seemed to be confusing which one to display. Intending to delete one of the CHATS I didn't realize I was in a menu that then proceeded to delete my ENTIRE CHAT CONTENT ACROSS ALL CONTACTS. An option to restore would be unique.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I really love chomp for its flexibility and themeing and it's pop-up is great but what I don't like is that they have been avoiding the issue of group texts. There are two issues that have been prevalent for a long time. One is that you can't get out of a group text and two is that you can't mute the notifications. Chomp has known about this for a long time and hasn't done anything about it which is why I give it a 3 instead of a 4 plus.,3

com.p1.chompsms,Sasa Vukusic,"The app is great, it has everything I need except one thing. There is no way to search for the contact I want to send to someone. If I want to send a contact to someone then I have to use ""pick contacts"", I don't have a ""find contact"" that would be far faster because I have over 600 contacts. I praise parsing messages from providers when I have a missed call and seeing right away who called me. That's very well done.

com.p1.chompsms,Connie Harvey,"The problem I'm having the app is that if a text fails to send, it doesn't tell me which text failed on the general texting window.

This app _seems_ to — but when I add a message to the blocklist it is still there. Also the text on the settings screen is almost unreadably fine.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love it but be VERY careful with delayed sending because if you set delay at, say, 8 seconds, then compose a message using voice to text, it will continue to put into the text whatever u say for those 8 seconds. So if you text ur boss ""yes ill work saturday"", hit send, then say ""u sniveling lackey"" thinking its not going to be included, it WILL also be included as Chomp continues to record during the delay period. This includes anything chomp might hear: car radio lyrics, your friend, whatever.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I love how this app allows you to send larger sized files than the factory stock messaging app. The ads are sometimes annoying but they appear at the top of the feed so they can be easily avoided.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Great messaging app. I had go SMS pro for years but resent apdates made that app pretty much take over my phone put layers of unneeded and unwanted screens to get through just to use it. I hope chomp sms stays focused on what we want instead of adding a bunch troublesome extra screens and hoops to jump through.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Been using Chomp for 10+ yrs. The main reason I use this messaging program over others is bcuz of its configuration/personalization ability. Chomp is one of the few msg platforms that allows the user to 1) Assign a specific notification tone to a specific contact. 2) Allows user to set a delayed send time to catch mistakes b4 msg is actually sent and 3) Allows user to schedule a specific date & time to send a msg in the future. Love it! Won't leave it!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Anand Nainar,"Does exactly what it is supposed to in the most straightforward way. Conventional SMS using carrier's talktime/voice. Data not required. So far, no problems with delays in sending and receiving. Lifesaver for me as my new phone didn't come with a native SMS function.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Music Lover,I've been using this app for many years and I've never had an issue with it - I love being able to personalize it - it's always the first app I put on my new phones! I also want to say how quick they responded to me last night when I was having that issue with the Google crash - they got back to me right away and told me what the issue was and how to fix it! Great customer service!,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"chomp caters to all my needs. I'm not a really big customizer but I like tweaking some stuff to suite my liking. I'm not really fond with their bold color palette, it would be nice to see some pastel for lighter tones. but overall I really like the app. easy to use and navigate",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"so far so good no issues last text app had issues after latest updates and at&t options. this one is fine so far. highly customizable. note to developers. I have phone horizontal a lot. and like last app, I would like to have pop ups to be able to come up in that mode also...",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have used Textra for a while, but I was having issues with large texts and their technical support wasn't able fix it, so I decided to switch to Chomp. Best decision ever! This app is reliable, innovative and useful.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I used 2 luv chomp messaging.. I even went as far as paying in order 2 stop seeing so many damn ads 😒🙄😡 but now I'm starting 2 rethink that... 4 awhile I wasn't seeing any ads at all while trying 2 type a message... but now, the past year if that, I started seeing ads again while using chomp... so I pay 4 this thing 2 avoid those ridiculous ads, but still get them worse than b4!!! I'll probably be switching 2 another txt app 👍",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"It does the job great! I barely even notice I'm using a 3rd party Messaging app, which is what I was hoping! I give this 5 stars, but that does not mean its perfect, its almost perfect though. My one complaint is that right above each text notification it says ""chomp SMS"", I wish it just said ""Message"" or ""Text"" or the name of whom ever the conversation is with. Its as I'm looking at an ad and I even paid money to this app. All in all, I give the app 90.1/100",5
com.p1.chompsms,rebbecca caouette,Can't Send or recive pictures. I've have been using this app for almost 10 years. I have never had this problem. The directions I received did not fix the issue. I would hate to have to dump this app. Its been so awesome like I said for the last 10 years. Please help,3
com.p1.chompsms,Brian B,"I've been using Chomp for quite some time mostly problem free, and today it continually crashes immediately after I attempt to open it. I have no idea why and I've reinstalled it, rebooted, cleared the cache several times, etc to no avail. I've looked into the developers solution, but it is of no help because the app they suggested I remove doesn't exist on my device.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I've been using this app as my default sms app for more than 6 months. It's ok. I started using it again because the default Google sms app lacks the template feature - huge oversight in my opinion. The thing is that people don't get all of my texts using this app. I've tried to figure out why but at the end of the day if people don't get my text and there is no error or indication as to why then I'm in the dark. Basically this app can not be relied on as a text messaging app.,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is a decent messaging app. HOWEVER, my phone goes off whenever I get a text even when my phone is on do not disturb and the app does not have priority notification status. Super annoying when I'm trying to sleep or focus and my phone keeps going off!",3
com.p1.chompsms,Jake Rohde,Works as expected. The ads aren't obnoxious. Just a small banner. No pop-ups so far,4
com.p1.chompsms,Karamat Ali Syed Jeelani,"All is well. Hope for Folders to move contacts or chats like important chats, cellular chats, etc in next Update.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I just recently went to another text application.. I kept getting complaints of people texting me and I never received the message.. I installed new text application and I discovered I had a total of 73 text messages undelivered through ChompSMS dating back to 2018.. my new text application allowed me to read all the messages from the past... I like the customization of ChompSMS but I wouldn't use it again. #CAPO,1
com.p1.chompsms,Denise Baker,"This is a nice app. I didn't think you could customize it much but you can. I'm not sure if that a pro feature or what. I would only make one suggestion, if it's not already available. It's nice when you can make the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. message bubbles different colors for group messages.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love it! I've used this app for probably 8 or 9 years now and love it. The ability to customize colors, fonts, and vibrations/ringtones for specific contacts is second to none. My favorite feature is the 3 second delayed sending option.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,This is by far an EXCELLENT text messaging app they hit this spot on. I quit using my messaging service because after sending 2 picture messages I was not able to send anymore and you know what I'm taking about (attachment limit reached) this has been working flawlessly since I've downloaded it plus all the different backgrounds you can change to this a must have app,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Back to 5 stars now that issue below is fixed. I had this on my LG Tribute and it worked great. Just got a LG Phoenix 4 and the app crashes when you delete texts from the main Chomp screen. Deleting individual texts from within a conversation works. Uninstalled and reinstalled with no luck. It did sent a feedback with logs seversl times. Update. At first the developer seemed to want to help. But despite sending logs and screenshots they no longer respond to emails rearding this issue.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"when an update for my messages came out, i couldnt read the names of my contacts as they were the same color as the background. Looked up good replacement apps and found this. paid 3 dollars to get rid of the constant ad, and now I have this great, customizable app that works so much better than the default messenger",5
com.p1.chompsms,Steve Brown,"What a great app. Used to use a rival app but it messed up an update. Switched to Chomp. Best move ever. Customization options is something else. Backgrounds, sounds, fonts and themes all on another level. Trialled and bought full version. Worth every penny.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Decent usability, but devs intentionally place popup adds right under the next anticipated spot a user will touch for 'free' ad click revenue for themselves... eventually got tired of opening constant 'suprise' ads (which waste my data) during conversations. Uninstalled and went with a competitor for better results. Will not recommend until they remove 'bait' clicking 'feature'.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Great messaging app. Occassionally doesnt send a message and I have to copy and paste and retry and then it works but it's only with a few contacts that this happens. It acts as if theres nothing typed to send. More reliable than the message app that came on my phone.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Right off the bat it has more features, easy on eyes and slides right in the programs no comparison, good job. Now I have had chomp a month and it's even better. The ads are on a top header which is non-intrusive, and all the perks makes that minicual event.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,EDIT: After getting a  response from chomp it seems there is no other options due to Android. There is a work around by directly installing an APK.  Not being able to control the notification icon color anymore is a huge blow in the latest update. That was one of the main reasons for me using the app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Angela Elder,"So far it's been a great app...no freezing, love that it's free and gives design choices!",5
com.p1.chompsms,James Kumar K.S,It is really good you will like reading your messages due to the colours you can add and edit. I wish it had archive and slide messages to delete and create new folder options to move important messages to that folder. However please note the best SMS app is probably the one you already have on the phone.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"After my phone got android 10 update, pop up notifications stopped working even though the option is turned on in settings. Can you please fix this issue. I like the app overall. Would be great to be able to move messages from certain people to private box.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Erika Giffin,"I love this and I never write reviews. But I would like to offer a few ideas, blocking group messages, blocking doesn't seem to work on mine regardless, being able to search in conversations would be nice like for pictures or attachments, a dark mode for settings, but this is by far my favorite app for messaging 💕",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I was mostly liking this app besides the ad at the top thats tricky and gets you to click it. It updated today and now there's some other pop up text banner across the bottom of the screen talking about Amazon that keeps appearing everytime I open it. If this is permanent I'll be uninstalling.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Brandi Schultz,"I love this app and all the options your giving to customize for what you like! I checked it out because I hated the messaging app that came on my new phone. I upgraded to the pro because it's so cheap, and a one time payment and you have the app for life. I have customized everything from the colors to a cute don't and size! Plan to use this for life on any phone!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sam Chan,"Certain mms seems to freeze app from group message. I had to delete massage in order to get back to the group. Chomp sms needs to work on mms and add features like allow user to copy certain part of the message, search conversion text and send audio messages like other text message apps. There is no option to block group spam messages. When will chompsms be updated with those features?",2
com.p1.chompsms,D Demvan,"Would be a 5 if had more options. How about a GIF search? And an easier way to add Bitmoji pics. Also could use different tones for message alerts for different contacts. Otherwise, great app! Got it souly for the time delay message send but has other great features too!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Louie Garcia,"At first chomp was a very good messaging app. i have been using this app for quite sometime now, but the problem recently is everytime i open the app it crashes and directs me to an online shop to be downloaded. I ignored it at first but its becoming annoying and i could not type anymore cause it keeps on crashing. please do something about it.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Clara Lisi,"The App Is Great ! Once I upgraded I noticed that the customization is awesome.. It's definitely a 100+% upgrade over the stock app.. BTW the $2-$3 cost for the upgrade is def worth it. I've used So Many other apps over the years and since installing this one, along with the upgrade, I'll never change it again !",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This has been my go to SMS app for years, with several different phones. Confused by the white notifications as every other notification I have is color. Red for gmail, blue for Facebook. I understand if its white in the top notification bar, but they can at least have color in the pull down.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Bryan P,"I've been having a lot of failed send messages and I've never experienced that with other messaging apps. Not ok, because it doesn't error out right away nor does it notify me when a message fails to send. This is a bug that needs to be fixed.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Mobile User,"No issue with app itself. Seemed fine as I was testing several of them. However problem is if you install this and then try to uninstall it, it still leaves background processes running on Android. In my case after full uninstall, still left a ""com.p1.chompsms"" running in the background utilizing battery and resources that I haven't figured out how to remove. Maybe the devs here have an idea and can chime in. Apps should cleanly uninstall themselves and not leave behind suspicious processes.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Michael Geragosian,"Great but it has minor issues. It does everything including scheduling texts, though scheduling could be easier. But, it doesn't like my wife and doesn't always receiver her texts. Also, the notification dot continues to appear next to texts I have already viewed.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Salezx,The only sms application that works!! everything is perfect and the most important thing is that it replaces the numbers in messages with the contact names!! PERFECT !! (Eg. When you get a message with numbers who called you) EDIT: WHY DID YOU STOPPED THIS APP?? AFTER UPDATE IT'S NOT SENDING ANYTHING !! Edit2: it Is newer versions problem. I downloaded old version of chomp and it works. And every other sms app works.,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is the only texting app I will use. This, with the G-board is the only way I can type a new line instead of opening the emoji keyboard. Chomp can be customized more than any other app I've ever used. I prefer it over the original SMS app on Android phones. It does have adds that occasionally appear where I'm trying to tap, which is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, but it's still one of the best apps I've ever used.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Sourav Maiti,"It's been long, means really really long, I am using this app. Started with free version, then got a pirated version for a while, and then end up buying the full version. This is the BEST sms I have ever used, But it's been 3-4Y there is no further development in this app, no sms organization feature etc. It getting hard to manage all transactional, promotional and personal message through this app. It seems like I have to bid a goodbye to this app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Yoamner Hector Fernandez,"Installed this to send individual messages to multiple recipients, checked the replies only to me setting, it still lumped everyone into a group chat. Additionally I dislike that it separates your contacts by phone number so you see the same person listed multiple times. Seems worse than the default messaging app",1
com.p1.chompsms,Nine,"I've been using this app for over 7 years, and one day I encountered a problem which made me to use a different SMS app. Up today the problem still hasn't fixed. When you have long conversations and you scroll deep enough, the app will lag and crash. One day it deleted one of my important conversations, that made me install a diff app which can handle long conversations without having a problem. This app is the best, but that flaw made me switch to a diff app. I don't need to email your CS.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Kellie,"Works fairly well. At times i don't get messages, but that is not very often. Overall, I'm satisfied.",4
com.p1.chompsms,miamibeachvf,It would be nice if we typing an composing a text message the message would appear full-screen so you don't have to scroll in that Tiny Box like some other text messaging apps do I also see where others have mentioned this if other text messaging apps can do it why not Chomp,5
com.p1.chompsms,Jus-7,So far it's good enough for me to opt for the paid version. The only things I would suggest is that there is a way to separate messages from unknown numbers vs contacts. Also some of the themes could be more interesting. EDIT: A feature I'd really love to see would be something to filter out messages from known contacts with unknown contacts.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Search function doesn't work, custom settings for individual contacts save but stock configuration still shows as what's set when looking at the settings, custom notification icons should be a standard feature. Overall a great messaging app, just needs a little tweaking.",4
com.p1.chompsms,kerry lee,"Honestly I have never had a issue with chomp other than sometimes it won't send pictures to Apple iphones , I don't mind the ads so much , yes prefer not having them at all, but that goes with any apps, I think it should be illegal to , have third parties access your info, from your phone , it invades your privacy. The app does not allow vcard reading it did with my samsung but not with pixel 3 any ideas",4
com.p1.chompsms,Danny Muhammad,"So I useed the champ app for a couple years and then it stopped working. Not completely but I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. The developer did respond saying they think it's my phone but I downloaded ""textra"" and haven't had any problems yet, but it's only been a week, so still not sure.. no offense to Chomp it probably works for everybody but me,,haha I'll be back with an update.",1
com.p1.chompsms,George Skites,"So far I've liked using chomp, it's better than the android messages because you can turn off the pop up noticiactions. The only issue is now I'm being told I have to pay for the service in order to have ads removed. That I don't like. May end up moving to another message app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,henk vegter,"Great simple app. Like the option to have recurring alarms for a new message and being able to forward and reply message content. On the downside, I can't delete a lot of messages without doing a ""delete all"" which off course deletes everything. This keeps my messages to a minimum.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jennifer Kilmer,"Well, seems like a good app but some things do not work. 1) the delivery status just shows 3 dots nothing more -pending. 2) u have to download themes which should be in the app. 3) unable to customize individual contacts screens. Please add these feature and fix the others. Thanks.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Cj Ponce,"So for the most part the app is great. It works fine, doesn't take long to load, and does everything that you'd expect. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't do a couple things that I REALLY wish it would. I wish it would let me text files that are larger than 1MB. I have short video clips that I can't send through chomp because of the size. The other are the themes. I know it's shallow of me, but I like appearances and the themes they have are limited.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Update: Chomp replied to their email and told me how to fix it! Is indeed a Samsung problem! I certainly thank y'all and recommend you 110%! Have used and bought years ago, certainly better than the built in for Android. If giving you a duplicate message on Samsung, even S10+, settings > Advanced features > Smart pop-up view > Chomp, change to Off not On.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I needed a texting app for my OnePlus 6T that did not favor emojis (I hate those things).  I also needed a texting app that allows me to EASILY backup and save conversations.  The Chomp SMS app serves both of those needs and is just as easy to use as any other texting app.  I am very pleased with my purchase.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Skip Sutton,Used Chomp for a couple of yrs. now. Lots of options to make the app your own. It's a good app. It's all about being able to customize colors & settings. Only thing I would suggest is expanding the texting area so I can SEE the top of of my text if I type more than a couple lines. Texting area should expand for longer texts.,4
com.p1.chompsms,John H- S,"Ever since the ads came on after the initial week this application has crashed frequently and is painfully slow. I've sent images to others on Android and are not available to them. My previous SMS program worked fine for images, didn't crash and was not so slow.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Jenna Chav,"I really enjoy the app that I just downloaded yesterday I love the customization to my liking the only downfall is every time I send a text message it says that it's pending on my end then it never sends because a red square on the side has an x so when I push it it tries to resend it but it still pending, I even had to restart my phone I did install and restart the app and I'm still having the same issue so that's why I gave it 2 Stars. 😔.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Bertil Axelsson,"Before Chomp I thought I had the best texting app available. Then when I came across this app, the Chomp, it seemed to be fairly prominent so I thought I would try it out. My experience so far has been nothing but great and it is the best one I have ever tried and I am now going on 4 plus years of great experience!!!! Customer service is also very responsive. Thank you!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Quality App. Many features including a wide range of themes and customization. I've never experienced any delays with sending or receiving SMS & MMS. I also like the fact this app is relatively small in comparison to other text apps.,5
com.p1.chompsms,AJ S,I have cell poor service in my area and lately the default google messenger won't send my texts even if I do have good service. Downloaded this and it sends text no problem even if my signal strength is weak to nonexistent. Very nice delivery service. The ability to customize is a dream. You can customize every single thing in a theme and make it perfect to your tastes which is fantastic if you like a theme but there's a few small things you dislike. You can even use your own background image,5
com.p1.chompsms,Madison Burgess,"Quick question 🤔. I just downloaded the app yesterday and when I look at the app today, it shows the little green dot, indicating that I have a new message. However, all my messages have been read and no new messages have been received today. Wanted to know why this little Green Dot is still there when there's nothing to check on. **Edit- Thanks! Your advice worked 👍😊",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"The only thing I'm semi worried about is the privacy as it has to do with ads on the free version . The customization is great and the messaging functions as good expect . Id like an built in encryption option in the future like other messaging apps, like whats app etc. Over all its bound to be better than your base sms. Edit:spelling and whatsapp.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Debbie Graham,"I was using Mood and was having mms issues. Chomp is more smoother and sending pics is faster and no issues of people not receiving them. Update, i cant update to the new version. There is no link to update when a new one comes out. I have written before and the same answer is the problem will be fixed in next update but it never does fix it",4
com.p1.chompsms,Dee Irvine,I love this app. There is a banner add in the top of the free version text list but it doesn't interfere with the app function at all. Plus you can customize each look of the person you are texting and it also supports bitmoji. Thumbs up. 5 stars,5
com.p1.chompsms,Barbara TGS,"⭐⭐⭐⭐Wow. So customizable! I easily set the font to Bold and increased the font size, and customized the color. I can finally read my texts!! One star taken away for the inability to see when your text was ""Read"" as my stock SMS did. Hopefully they can add that function. I will change to five stars if they do.💕So pleased though.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Kim Wood,"Excellent so far Only recently installed. However it's so much better than my default app already. I particularly like customised text tones for contacts, the quick reply function box, custom colours and most importantly you can turn off text alerts sounding whilst you are in the conversation they are arriving in.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Kelly Schwartz,I used this app for years and loved it. A problem arose with MMS on Android 10. (didn't work at all) No fixes were made for a while BUT now it's back to it former great condition. Extremely customizable and repeat notifications at perfect intervals.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Linda Dunn,"Been using for 2 years. Great app for elderly users. Font can be increased, and choice of colors for sight problems. However, how can I make the most recent texts go to the top so I don't have to search for them (especially in the pinned contacts)? Thanks!",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very pleased with this app. Allows me to text Apple as well as non-Apple users (I am a non-Apple). Very flexible and customizable. I am not a major power user so really haven't done anything Earth shattering with it but it completely meets my needs...SMS, MMs, emojis, links to browser, and many other things.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Ry Schulz,"It's not a good test messaging application. It does not allow you to preview a conversation before typing. It does not allow you to search gifs to send to contacts. I used it until it told me to upgrade to pro, or have free with ads. No thank you.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Erin Schumacher,"Love this app so much! Works consistently, lots of options for customization. The only thing I wish it had is the ability to scroll back in texts by specific dates, and to search media/images. But it's my new favorite texting app for sure!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Chomp saved me after i had to swap out my wonderful Blackberry bold w/ its amazing texting for the Blackberry Key2, which was amazing in every way except the android texting. AND TEXTRA SAVED ME! Again i can compose BEFORE i address it. I can spontaneously add recipients and NOT make it a fixed Group. And their HELP is amazing. When i was struggling with how to send to MANY but be the ONLY one to receive replies they emailed me all day, ultimately suggesting Textra JUST for that. CHOMP ROCKS!",4

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,It works very well and the fact that it's customizable is really great too! It does exactly what it's designed to do with no adds or interruptions. A very good replacement app for the default messaging app. I definitely recommend this app to anyone,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like chomp better than Message+ because I can control where pictures are stored, keeping my local storage freed up. I do wish the search function was more like Message+, but altogether I really like this app. I love that I can customize notification tones.",5
com.p1.chompsms,cA Pañebe,"A great alternative to the stock messaging app. Keep up the good work, Chomp SMS!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,WARNING! THIS APP ATTACKS USERS WITH CLICKJACKING by replacing the message you want to open with an ad just milliseconds before you tap to open said message. App has already been reported to Google with a takedown request. Many other users have reported this issue and support has been constantly lying and blaming the user for having slow internet. everyone knows thats a lie. They could easily code the app to reserve a space for ads. This is proof that support and developers cant be trusted.,1
com.p1.chompsms,K M,"This is a pretty solid app, but it's missing one key feature I really like, which is the ability to see all media (pictures, etc.) In a conversation. Other SMS apps have something to show them all at over and I don't see that here",3

They would take several mins to send & receive. Other times they would not send or come through at all. I used this app mainly for the 'Delay Send' feature. Now, I have a Note 9 and wish Samsung would have that feature on their stock messaging app. Since chomp has MMS issues, I am sticking with the phone's default app for now.",3

I had a query early on (about setting up new groups), emailed (on a Sunday) and had a response within hours helping me sort my problem. Great looking app, fabulous customer service.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"A little tricky at first to use but once i got the hang of it, i built a lovely Star trek theme for my SMS. Not sure if the theme can be backed up? If it can't that's a pain but otherwise i think this app is great and soon i will go pro. Even though the advertising is very discreet.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This app is almost perfect. I'm a pro user so the features it offers is great. I just wish I could customize my font on edit box for replying. I can customize everything else but that. Please allow. Also, I can't seem to change my message notification anymore.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Chomp was great up until about 2 weeks ago when I couldn't delete text messages. Tried everything,but still couldn't fix the problem. Even emailed l for help and was told they weren't sure either. Ended up uninstalling and using something else",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Far better than most stock text apps, Chomp has plenty of features I've really come to like. The UI is almost completely customizable, there are plenty of alternate emoji sets to choose from, and much more. Easily my favorite text app by quite a margin.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jennifer Guberman,"I had to stop using my Pixel's deafult messaging app due to issues they weren't fixing, so I tried to search for a free alternative. Chomp is it! It was really easy to transition to. Messaging is easy, pictures come through no problem, etc. Great app!",5
com.p1.chompsms,KEVIN WIGGINS,It doesn't allow you to customize sound notifications from individuals in your contacts when receiving a text... Also I noticed no change with sending text messages with larger file sizes. I set the limit to 4 MB but that still did not work for me.,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Used for awhile and it seemed just fine. Then started having texts with a red mark next to them,with no explanation as to what happened. Why did numerous texts not go thru, and why not re-sent when possible. Happens so often now, had to switch to a different app.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I was looking for an easy text messenger with little or no commercials and Chomp SMS fulfills that wish list BIG Time. The ads don't get in the way which encourages me to read them. I also like being able to enter my text first before having to give the recipient.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Very good messaging system. Like varoious setting options and scheduled message option. The team was prompt in response when I had an issue recently. Things I would like: ability to schedule MMS. Ability to email or download and save conversations. Make it easier to do fonts etc.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Nan C Row,Love all of the customization options. It was really hard to pick just one at a time.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love the app except I keep getting a check your Apn settings notification, which I can't 😒 & it's annoying, because along with the constant notification, it also means I'm not receiving pics. I've tried uninstalling & re-installing several times, still doesn't fix the problem.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I loved this app & even paid for the premium version but it no longer deletes conversations & I'm not a fan of their other app Textra. I emailed their help department but they were no help at all & just blamed my Android version (V9) & my phone (OnePlus 6T) which isn't acceptable & just an excuse in my opinion. If they fix the issue with it no longer deleting conversations, I'll change the rating to a 5. Otherwise don't expect them to be helpful if you have the newest & latest phone or software.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Matthew Lemmers,"Android 11 arrived with the LG V60 finally. Performance seems about the same as prior version. I have a Galaxy S21 as well and I see the same thing. The actual app is great, but for some reason there's this scrolling lag in the conversation list. Fix this, and add bubble support like Textra and this is still a great application.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love the way you can fully customize. It makes my phone uniquely mine. Had to delete the app. For some reason it just stopped sending picture messages. I changed settings, deleted and reinstalled to no effect. Really sad to let it go.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Terry Blanchard,"After the 2 preinstalled messenger apps start having issues , I searched and reviewed the many messenger apps . I decided to try chomp SMS and am totally satisfied with it so far . I've been using chomp for about 9 months with no issues . It's easy to navigate & has far more features than I'll use but for the average user like myself it works great",5
com.p1.chompsms,PETER KARSIOTIS,"2 things: a. It will be better the number of the sim card not to be inside the button sending the sms but outside so as the change of the sim card to be done immediately and not by pressing the sending button for some seconds. b. I have chosen the delay before sending a sms. It is better until the sms has been sent, after i have pressed the sending button, not to be able to write someting else in the field where we are composing the sms. Can these 2 things be fixed?? Thank u.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Seems like it works well and you can customize it decently. My issue is that it will not send GIFs that I want to send. It acts like it sent it but it never shows up for me or the person I sent it to. Disappointing as I definitely use those often to communicate with.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Brittany Gentry,"So far so good. Edit: 5 to 1 stars. I'm suddenly having an issue with my contact lists. I have A LOT of deleted phone number popping up. I went through fixed everything in my contacts app, cleared caches everywhere, and I still have number of people who have passed away popping up. I don't even know where it's pulling this information from. Sent an email out for a different issue and no response, so why bother with this one?",1
com.p1.chompsms,Me,Hey! What gives? I've been using this app for a couple of years and all of a sudden I have multiple contacts telling me they arent getting my texts. When I switch back to the phone app they can. And after switching to phone app I also get incoming texts that didnt come to Chomp from weeks back. Have had to uninstall Chomp to get reliable messaging. S21 Ultra. Fully updated.,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Works well with customization, only issue is I can't figure out how to customize color and size of names in group chats. Very hard to read these names. Also, I really wish there was a widget with paid version so I could see texts on home screen.",4
com.p1.chompsms,northofman,I love Chomp. It was easy to set up and it works like a charm. I had tried about 3 other apps. My worst experience was one that seemed to take over my phone. And on some of them the ads were overbearing. No issue with this on Chomp. Of course there are ads but they do not dominate the app. Well done Chomp team!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Look At Me Photography,"OKKKKK sooooo I purchased the app, before I was only using the free version. I loved it than and still loving it but what I do not like are the spam text messages that I get almost daily. My blocklist is FULL! LOL Anyway, if something can be some about the SPAM TEXTS the app would be absolutely perfect in my opinion or as close to perfect! It not not my phone because I never get spam texts using the huislt in messenger app. It's not a deal breaker though, super annoying though.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Tim Lawrence,"I was using SMS plus for years, after an update it was all screwed up. They didn't fix it, so i installed chomp SMS. Love this app!!! U can send multiple pics, select just cell number that show when starting a message. So much better. Def recommend this app!!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Marinate Dat Mind Wit Chyna 405,I would give give this more stars but when a text message alert comes through and you're on a call you cannot just pull down from the top of your screen to stop the alert you have to go all the way into the text messages and open up the text for the alert to stop that's crazy and it won't send out the signature that's on your text messages unless you're actually inside the app you can't answer the text outside the app and it sends a signature with Trying to find another app,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great replacement for the default phone app. Has all the features I was looking for. Free version has ads but they are not intrusive at all.Great app, plan on getting the pro version to support the author. Great job on this.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Happy Campers!,"Been using Chomp for several years now.. It's been flawless. I don't normally give reviews but it's earned.. Great features including a 1 to 10 second delay after you hit send. (gives your eye time to see a mistake till it actually sends) Way to go Chomp... Keep it up.. Thanks for a good program, Great app..",5
com.p1.chompsms,Robert Kaplan,This app is super high risk for your phone. I am a computer tech of 30 years. When a company writes code it should test all that is relevant to what will be handled by the app. In the case of chomp SMS I saw a review about its inability to render a gif file when sent through MMS. Sure enough the app destroyed my GIF files. I contacted the team via email and they were in total denial. Who knows what other faulty coding is hidden in this program. Google found a better app that works with gif.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Darren Griggs,Awful app - wasn't actually sending texts for a week!! I installed this to replace the basic messaging app and realised that it hasn't actually sent any messages for a week when I text my partner!! I use my phone for business so was horrified to find this issue. Has put me off all and any messaging apps unfortunately. Of I could rate zero stars I would,1
com.p1.chompsms,Susan Yingling,"It's free to download, but after a trial period there will be ads at the top of your feed, unless you pay to remove them. On a positive note, the ads are small & not obnoxious. Chomp's color & graphics are excellent!",4
com.p1.chompsms,K g,"So far, haven't had any problems. Love message popup box. And it also automatically compresses pictures sent in chomp app.... Something google messages doesn't do.

com.p1.chompsms,Zara Zimmer,"I've used this app for years and I've always loved it. Lately I'm having an issue with attaching photos to messages. When I choose a photo, it just gets stuck on compressing. I have to end up force closing the app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jim,Been using it for years on several different phone. Love it. But... I just downloaded it onto a Samsung S20 and I can't seem to turn off the keyboard sound. I hate the tic tic tic sound every time I press a key. I must be missing something but I can't find it now.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Quasi Terrible,"Terrible spam management. Spam senders just have to create a group message and it makes you unable to block them, then you get spammed with all the poor bastards who think texting opt out will do anything. The app only allows you to delete the message itself. But as soon as someone replies to it, it starts all over again. Used to be a great app, but now you should avoid it until they update their block features.",1
com.p1.chompsms,jjdubs W,Very positive overall. Wish I could customize text sounds for various contacts (like making some of them silent). Would also like to be able to block contacts from a (sp@m) text. I could also change contact details if allowed to make another app primary and then use this with texts.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Ashley James,"I only downloaded this to be able to send ""size limit reached"" videos from my phone through sms. It never worked, not even after changing the settings as instructed. Im deleting this worthless app now before it damages my device. Thanks so much for wasting my time and u probably stealing all of my personal info.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Kickn8,* Thanks for the developer's quick response.. bummer that Google won't allow 3rd party access to the RCS API..but despite the lack of RCS.. I will still use this app and probably alternate between this and Google Messages. I think if you were to add in the Swipe to Archive from the conversation list.. that would help out a lot... It's still one of the best apps around 🤗,4
com.p1.chompsms,Yolanda Jones,I absolutely love this app. Switched from Google because I couldn't send more than two pictures at a time. This app has been wonderful no issues. I hope and pray that you can eventually add the option for color skin changes on emojis....🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,its the best messaging app but the adds are specificly designed in a way for you to accidently click on them. They have a delay when you open the app then they take up the first space where you would normally tap so you end up tapping an add instead of opening the messages youre trying to open.,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Really love how easy this text messenger is to use. If you want to customize the talk bubbles which I did. Super easy and it won't take up much space on your phone either for the customizations either. Recommend this text app for your phone.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have been using Chomp for about a month now and I like it. It is user-friendly, has a lot of themes and you can use your own sound for notifications. The only thing I would like is to have a swipe ability to delete text. 9/20/19 - Have been using Chomp almost 6 months and put on wife's phone. I really like it, but as I said in the above review, I would like to see swipe to delete. I am happy 😊 with it.",4

The customization option is fantastic. My default app couldn't do half the things yours can do. I've been searching for an app like this and FINALLY FOUND IT! Also there's not many ads and it is very easy to use. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful app! Keep up the good work! -Ashley,5
com.p1.chompsms,marc krigel,"(1) cannot swipe to delete. (2) Chomp places a conversation at the top of the list only after hitting ""send"", instead of when drafting a note. (3) Cannot link to recipient's contact info by tapping on their name / picture during authoring, (4) When receiving or sending a phone number that is in contact list, Chomp displays the name of the contact, but not the number.  When there are several phone numbers for the contact there is no way of determining the number. Uninstalling",2

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I like the functionality and customizability of the app but I have frequent episodes where It misses texts that I will either get on my computer or via a different texting app. Essentially I can't trust it to receive all of my texts so I have to change to a different SMS app.,3

Other than that, it's the best couple of dollars I've spent on an app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Installed this app because it would apparently send messages that were long without splitting them into numerous messages.

Having said that it's not Chomp's fault that restrictions applied on API 26 have resulted in only having a white notification icon available, which is bizarre to say the least. Earlier versions of Chomp are fully functional pre API 26 (and no ads) so why are Google messing with Android 8? it makes no sense.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Dan Sperduto,I enjoy the app's features Being able to have a few seconds delay before the text gets sent is helpful to ensure swiped text doesn't embareass you!. Timed texts for some later time frame is also awesome. Use this for business alot! Group testing feature is very good. Only needed tech support once while waiting in airport. Blew my mind when they responded in minutes with a solution. Love this application. An update from my initial 2019 review... Chomp continues to be my only texting app. Love it.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,So far I really like how easy this is to use. i like the keyboard and it responds quickly. I wish I could find a way to assign my contacts individual ringtones which also worked in a group text to identify each individuals who responded.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Rich Behrmann,"Been using Chomp for several years. Great customization!

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Good app but when I try to search messages and I find one that is matching the criteria. now I want to click on that particular message.

Wouldn't be surprised if it were that way going forward.",1
com.p1.chompsms,EMS,Loved this a few years ago but it's now terrybly outdated. Where's swipe actions for a start? I've also tried Textra but they insist on the swipe actions being the opposite of EVERY other app - swiping right instead of left - and refuse to change it despite countless others disliking it for the same reason. This dev used to make the best SMS apps but now they're stuck in 2016. Time to move on.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Keith Cresswell,"It's important for me to be able to assign different notification tones for different senders. Unfortunately despite setting a specific tone, using the long press method, I only get the default tone.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Have been a long time user. Great app just two complaints: Would like to be able to remove some of the ugly emoticons and more importantly, I despise the baneful feature whereby any phone number in my contacts is transformed into some sort of link. It doesn't work for at least half the people I send it to. I want the ability to disable that substitution completely. Otherwise a decent app. With those remedied, I would give this app five stars.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Kevin Haney,"It does MORE than Droids use to do in 2012. Scheduling is a super bonus. Having sms to groups back is essential. And it locks a message which my newest phone does not. I wish it could group contacts, then it would be my one and only app to do it all.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Stuart D,"Good app, easy reading of SMSs but would really like popup snippet of most recent received SMS on lock screen rather than just unread MSGs notification. Snippet function only works once if all previous SMSs are deleted. And 20 minutes later answered, then followed with solution. If only support like this was applied to everything in life, we'd have no problems.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Overall, pretty good texting app...I switched to it so I could send memes and gifs more effectively than the standard app installed on my Android phone. The old app would condense or speed up the pic or video and it would lose it's intended value...",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Thinking about switching to chomp from textra. does chomp have a function to automatically delete texts after XXX amount of texts in a conversation? (set to 250 or 200 or whater). I cannot locate that setting. Also, does chomp have a setting to send a notification of failed sms or mms? Cannot locate that either",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I'm a musician/teacher so I rely on sms/mms communication. I purchased Chomp after trying it out. I *had* to have the ability to *lock* messages. Well worth paying for that feature. I wish the themes were more diversified; some are good IMHO, but the majority are nothing I'd use. 04/14/2020 uninstalled... I've experienced times when Chomp won't download an MMS msg & the only way to get it is to activate the default Messages Android app. That always works. So I'm looking at other sms apps again.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This App is AWESOME. I would recommend this app 120%. It just works! Well done to the Chomp Team! Is there a possibility to update the deletion and reply, by simply swiping left on the message itself for ""delete"" and swipe right on the message for reply. (similar to the Samsung Mail app)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Michelle Lee,"I just want to put the word out to everyone who is hesitant about using ""Chomp"". Don't be! I Love this app★ Its awesome! Plus there aren't tons of ads slowing down texting. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed! I hardly use texting apps but it had soon many different themes that you can custom make to fit your mood, personality, whatnot. Thanks ""Chomp"" for putting the effort & creativity into this 5★★★★★ app!!! -Michelle@San Antonio, Tx210",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Does not perform flawlessly. I was forced to delete a whole conversation to be able to send a msg to that person. Customizing is ok but crashes a lot while making changes. Edit: the crash during theme modify seems to be corrected.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I think this app is a lot more smooth in terms of UI. It's way better than the one I used to use. The app has more features and settings than I have the patience to look through; so i guess that's good. lol. One thing I would love to have is a button on the push notifications to ""mark as read"". If I'm just too ignorant to notice this and it's already in the app settings, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let me know how to enable it. Thank you!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Simon French,Overall it's ok but when searching for a contact i can't always find them in chomp. I have to go to my contacts and message from there. It doesn't ping when i send a message. Could just be I'm used to my old sms app. Maybe I'll get used to it,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love this app..been using it for a couple of years and wouldn't use anything else. It's great that you can customize it and change the themes whenever you want...means you don't get bored with colour, font style etc. Brilliant!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I actually love this app. i used the ""messaging"" app for YEARS with android, but the recent update on my phone messed up the ability fof the messaging app to use my Gallery, so no more photos. i tried this one as a repacement and it's so much better The customizations are great. Super happy with it",5
com.p1.chompsms,Onyx Obsidian,I really like this app. I wish the ability to delete texts was a little more efficient. Like a sliding gesture. I wish I could archive/backup texts. And I'd also like a companion app for my galaxy watch 4. Keep up the good work!,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"A few years back when I switched to a smart phone, a colleague of mine told me chomp SMS should be one of the first apps I installed. I did and never switched to another one. Not a power user. Love the UI. Thank you :)",5

com.p1.chompsms,Paula Killingsworth,This would be a great app if it didn't take forever to actually send my text messages. I send a message and it ticks and vibrates immediately. However it's a long time before my messages are received by the people I've texted. So I'm uninstalling this app.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Dragonflyofdarkness,"I was using this app for a couple years loved it. But after a while some of my contacts would not receive my text messages at all. And those contacts oy grew. I changed my phones, my service provider... And AFTER 2 YEARS OF PROBLEMS I UNINSTALL THIS APP AND EVERYTHING WORKS! This app is terrible. I want to laught And cry at the same time because for whole 2 years this APP was the thing to blame!",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Love this app!! I can get this app to popup on my Android even when locked. I can text right away and see all of the message and respond. All while phone is locked. Much better than just a sms prompt message and unlock to get to message I highly recommend. I have been using this for years and keep it on all my new phones. Thanks Chomp SMS,5
com.p1.chompsms,Charles Schwab,"Chomp is good, but my question is whether it has been infiltrated by some form of malware? I'm referring to the advertising SMS messages in the free edition. Lately there is frequently bad spelling in them and I have checked with VirusTotal on a couple of the url's in messages which flags them as potentially dangerous malware. I do hope that the Chomp app is and remains safe. But now wondering. Hope all really is OK. ?????",4
com.p1.chompsms,LiQuiD,I absolutely love Chomp and him been using it for a very long time. But lately all of my MMS messages do not go through and default me to check APN settings. Any photo I send will repeatedly send over and over and over and over to my recipients causing them to get angry at me thinking I'm screwing with them. I have to uninstall this app now I guess.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Master Franklin,Great little texting app. Not overpowered with bloatwear or advertising. I would have given it five stars but it vibrates every time I send a text and you're unable to turn that off. Just irritating. I don't need to be notified I'm sending a text.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Lenny Card,"I just started using this app last month and it was doing great then all of a sudden it won't send out my text. I tried to restart my phone that didn't work, then I forced stopped the app and then restart my phone and it seemed to fix it for a while but now it's doing it again so I have to go through the same thing as before. I hope it clears it up",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Any images taken through Chomp became blurred..support were good but could not solve the problem and eventually stopped trying to help me, I also had the same issue with their sister app Textra, which I have used for many years, except with Textra it was not only blurred images but also images that would not send..it is obviously a recent software problem as I have never had this problem before..I tried two other app's and they worked fine..so it is not my phone",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,chomp is a great alternative to stock messaging app. i tried a couple of others and this is the best fit for me. pros very simple to use. has a bunch of themes which is nice. cons takes forever to open attatchments. i get a constant apn settings needs to be changed even though i have changed settings. no easy option for me to request help and too lazy to look so i just deal with it,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is the BEST messaging app out there in my book😀. I have been using it solely for over 6 months now. It's a AWESOME replacement messaging app. I decided to go PRO and it's the cheapest pro messaging app on the market that includes all the awesome features and themes! If y'all are looking to replace your stock messaging app, Chomp is the ONLY way to go! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed 😉♥️♥️.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Pearl Rose,"It's impossible to find a good, ad-free sms app. Even if I've paid for the app, I find they all glitch to a degree or have an extremely poor choice of themes & graphics.

com.p1.chompsms,Gary Farmer,"I like the many color schemes they have to offer. I like the Blocklisting for Spam texts. I like the repeat notifications, and the variable times between notifications that you can set. This latest (large) keyboard and all of it's icons are very nice!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Syxguns Adrian,"Great SMS app. Has all the features I need. Not as customizable as some that are available, but I was able to get a pretty nice layout. Easy to use and reliable. I enjoy Chomp for the simple and easy to manage messenger that it is!",5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I've tried a lot of texting apps and always come back to chomp. Like it's appearance and I wanted to be and to pin a text to the top. I messaged the developer and got an immediate response! Long hold on contact pins to top.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Sourcandy 1992,Good app I don't mind the adds. I think I'm able too tell when my message is sent . I wish it was like the iphone so I can see the bubble if read and sent.

com.p1.chompsms,Karen McM,"Works pretty well most of the time now. Periodically it doesn't transmit a text, but I don't usually find out until a day later, assuming I open the text I thought I'd sent, to discover a red exclamation point, meaning the send failed.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Justin Lawson,Basic and a little rudimentary but it does what they said it does. I couldn't find any bugs per say. The deletion of bulk messages and the message interface where you switch between message list and messages is abrupt and needs improvement.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Hi im enjoying this app. However, im having an issue regarding the notifer badge count. It doubles the count of the messages that received. I already followed the instruction which is to turn off the default messaging app's notificarion. Still Im encountering the same issue. My phone is hwawei p30 pro. Please advise coz I want to continue using this app. Thank you.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Larry Vince,"After using this app for years, it's become too unreliable. I've been not getting messages in Chomp that the default messenger finds when I switch. It's a shame because I loved the feature set but I can't live with the unreliability. By guys!",1
com.p1.chompsms,Kay Morris,"Hmmm. What do I like about Chomp? Everything! I've used this app for about 3 years now. It's easy to set up, has delayed send, and tons of different themes, colors, and backgrounds so you can personalize what you see. It's a great app. I definitely recommend it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like being able to customize themes. However on the conversation list, I have conversations that I deleted months ago. It seems like they are ghost images and will not delete. 🥺 Update: uninstalled due to ghost conversations that were deleted months prior and we're not on stock sms app.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Had high hopes for this app. Worst thing is that I can NOT send pics through it. Ads pop in at top of messages and push down others so you frequently accidentally hit ad when you are trying to send message to someone. Picture problems killed it for me.,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"lots of customizations, user friendly, not many ads. One of the best. If there were more shapes to the text bubbles it would be awesome! I think this is the only messaging app that shows text smileys as emojis. Thank you! 👍",5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,It's very annoying to go to click on a new message only to end up clicking on the ad that suddenly pops into the same spot that the new message was. Edit: so it's months later and the ads still get in the way of new messages.,2

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love it. I used to use GOSMS; however, it has been completely screwed up for over a year so I decided to jump ship. I customized the appearance on Chomp exactly to my liking. I'm very happy with this product. One ask: private box. That's the only thing missing.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Randy,Chomp is the most customizable text messaging app that I have found. Tired of trying to read tiny font? Chomp actually let's you increase the font size which other messaging apps don't. You can also change chat bubble colors and much more. I highly recommend Chomp! 👍😁,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,A great option for texting. It was the only app I could find that used both message templates and scheduled texts. My only complaint is that you have to discard each scheduled message before writing the next one.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Dale Amburgey,Text threads won't update while looking at them. I'll get the notification but I have to go back to the list of message threads and then back into the current message for it to show the new one. That's pretty critical functionality to just be broken...,1
com.p1.chompsms,Myisha C,I have been using chompsms for years for both personal and professional use and I absolutely love it. It is exactly what I want in a text app. I especially love the feature of being able to email entire text threads for my records.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love this app. It's my favorite for msging. EXCEPT for the fact that there is no edge lighting option at all. My Samsung s10 does not have led lights for notifications. I keep them on vibrate because of my job, so the only way for me to find out if I have msgs is to physically check when the screen is off. Fix this and you get 5 stars from me.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love this app! Able to personalize everything! Delay sending is great, in case you need to correct something after you hit send. Schedule messages is also a great feature. Also, great support.",5
com.p1.chompsms,CiCi Williams,Horrible. I don't know what happen with this app over the years but I downloaded to use and my text does not show. It's like the person texting me just sent a bunch of text talking to themselves. My replies are not there. Also the last text I sent to someone doesn't even show . I don't recommend this app anymore,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,This company has been taking money off me for years! I only just noticed. I looked into it and maybe I could have signed up years ago but I read it's a once off payment but I've been charged every year for about 3 years and then twice this year??? Finding it hard to find a cancel option or a contact number. This just screams a dodgey scam!!! EDIT: IT'S BEEN A MONTH AND A HALF WITH NO REPLY!!!! SEVERAL EMAILS SENT!!!!! REFUND ME!!!!!,1
com.p1.chompsms,Roger Peters,I love the customization options. Assigning notifications to individual contacts is the key feature. My only criticism: I wish there was a blanketing feature for blocking every and all sms message from an email addresses.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"SUPER FUN AND CUSTOMIZABLE. Works perfectly whether you customize it or not. BUT if you like making an app your own, this one is the best. Every feature can be customized and it's super easy to figure out how. Chomp just makes life more fun!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nicole Weber,Used to be fantastic. But after the latest update the app no longer tells you how many messages you have and therefore no longer is recognized in a vehicle. I'll have to move on to a different app since I need a messaging app that does connect to my car.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Greg Fisher,One star until the issue with disappearing text is resolved. I have already contacted you several times and went through the steps and nothing changed. And I have seen at least one review with the same issue. Already tried your other app that's not a solution.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Ed Young,"So far, So good. I installed it because my phones stock SMS texter thing got hijacked. I got added to a MMS group text thing I didnt solicit, or want, and theres was no way to block & delete the mfers. Evidently its the latest thing, and as far as I can tell, this one or any of the others have added the block all & delete feature. This is a must fix situation, in my humble opinion. So far LOVE the CHOMP!!! THANKS!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I choose this app because it has the option to delay send time on all messages. I have my messages on an 8 second delay. I like this a lot only wish I could make it a 10 to 15 second delay. Overall a good app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Worked like a dream for a few months. Then out of nowhere it stopped sending and receiving messages. I tried other messaging apps and they worked fine, but every time I came back to Chomp, it wouldn't work. Sad because it's one of the best messaging apps I've had.",2

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"My review is in comparison with the default Android messaging app, which really sucks. This app is stable, had no issues with MMS, and shows the date & time for every message. That's all that I needed, and I have it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Wolf Bite,Love being able to set the display how I like. HATE how some messages come in as mms (understand reason) BUT HATE that I can see the message in chomp but cant backup the messages (shows as Subject: null in chomp conversation & COMPLETELY missing in any other app that backups the sms message) Either way this is not a FULL backup 4.5 but 3.5 sick of all the missed sms backups,3

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great app, except it doesn't support gifs, even in Pro. May seem minor, but in this era of rich communication, gifs are commonplace.

com.p1.chompsms,Lee Stott,I use to love this app until the latest update. Now it won't save my message tones for my contacts. After the update I lost them all. Put them back in but they won't stay. I've deleted the app and reinstalled it and still it doesn't save my tones.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,not to bad i guess. i really liked it a first but the ad at the top of the message list is annoying and my gifs do not play anymore. i would give more stars if they fixed the gif issue at least. they used to play when i first downloaded the app but now they don't.,2

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Good app. I'd give it a great rating if the interface for scheduling text messages was like Verizon Messenger. I use schedule text all the time and it's too difficult to track what still in que. Change the scheduling part please!,3
com.p1.chompsms,John Moore,I enjoy using this app. I do appreciate the ability to reply when a text comes directly although it takes some time to understand where your written reply is located. It would be an improvement if your reply was directed to only one place and you could immediately see it as you type.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Liked it, but on Sprint could never get it to receive/send MMS. It always failed; I'd tap on the failed notification; it'd go away for awhile, then return. My provider's help forum suggests that installing Textra will make the problem disappear.",2

I am a pretty laid back person, and avoiding drama was a priority. Most other messaging services, if a blocked number sends you a group text, it still comes through, even though the text is from a blocked number. This individual used that loophole to continue sending me texts and photos even though I had asked her to stop. Chomp was a lifesaver, as now I avoid harassment.",5

com.p1.chompsms,Pasquale Alessia,Update I've been using this app for several months and it just keeps getting better and better and the most important thing of all there is no ads at all which is a big factor not counting how good this app is.

com.p1.chompsms,Matthew Plante,"Despite the ads at the top, it was a fantastic app. However, in the last couple days, it has become unusable. It force closes in the first 10 seconds of opening the app. I am going to have to switch messenger apps today and I don't like that.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like this app. I wish it had a slide delete and an option to archive. Also, I notice some texts pop up and I press close (to deal with them later) and the message disappeares from my text list.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Latest update sucks. I don't care about the white notification icon. I do have a huge problem with in app notifications now. I am unable to mute them and have to shut the app down to stop it. Might have to switch even though I've used chomp for years.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I used to love this app, but I just updated and they claim that Google will no longer allow for color notifications so you only have late notifications. But then at the very top of the conversation screen is a big ad it's much more annoying than the ads before. when uninstalling and using the stock messaging app",1
com.p1.chompsms,dean may,"It's good not too much to complain about. One really annoying thing tho is that conversations you've had recently completely disappear off the list and you have to manually search for the conversation, this seems to be random",4
com.p1.chompsms,Adam Alden,"I have no complaints with the Chomp messaging app. I no longer receive double text messages since switching over. If you don't mind the adds being displayed at the top of your text list, I would recommend using Chomp.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Brittany houghton,Very colorful backgrounds and text types notification sounds. No problems getting messages. If something don't come through it notifies you right away. Also alerts to spam text. Great alternative to regular messages.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I'm on a mission looking for the perfect sms app. I will give a star for each of my 5 criteria i can find in a single app. 1. Group Chat functionality ......Yes 2. Ability to rename a group chat.... No 3. Ability to have custom backgrounds in all lists/chats.. Yes 4. Lifetime membership option (if needed) ... yes 5. ability to embed .gifs ........yes,4

com.p1.chompsms,Laurie Allen,"WAS a fantastic app. LOVE customization options, but for a long time I've been unable to send or receive gifs/pics. Sometimes even regular text mssgs don't go thru. Most convos are peppered w/ exclamation points inside red triangles where stuff didn't send. Reinstalled but no change--just a lot of lost mssg threads. I use FB Messenger when I want to send photos & my family knows to send me photos that way. As much as I hate the Big Evil that is Facebook, I never have any problems w/ Messenger.",3

Oh well, Uninstalled and Moving on! 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️",1
com.p1.chompsms,Zay Scott,You would think in this modern time there would be an option to swipe to delete. Update: I would give more than 2 starts when you add that feature. It's too basic a feature to not ready be included.,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Editing my review from 5 stars down to 1 star. I THOUGHT the blacklist feature blocked and deleted spam. Well...it doesn't. It just hides it and even worse, IT MARKS SPAM AS READ! For some reason I was getting a bunch of spam texts all of a sudden. I opened my stock messaging app and alllll the spam texts I ""blacklisted"" using Chomp were still listed and READ. Uninstalled immediately. Hardly a security feature at all. Blacklisting doesn't block crud! Stupid, stupid, stupid.",1

I had a question and I couldn't find any other way to contact them .. and I am so late but they basically responded immediately! So on top of efficient customer service, this is truly an amazing app! I used to faithfully use GoSMS for years before this. I traded that for Chomp and I haven't been disappointed yet. I love to customize and this has millions of options! Very detailed customization. 👌",5
com.p1.chompsms,mca,"I've been using your product for several years now and love it. With one caveat.. Why can't you include blocking email addresses and something within an email in your application? (profanity for example or any word) I know back in the 90's AOL had features like that... Seems like such a small thing.... I'd give you 10 stars if you could mimic ancient AOL technology! V/r, Michael Allen Galaxy 9 Android 10. Boston, Ma",3

I hope you can resolve this issue because despite that, I still prefer to use this app. I just make it sure to restart my phone once in awhile.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Michal Lentowicz,I like chomp because you can really customize it. My phone is a fallout green theme and its not essy to find apps to customize like that. It would be nice to also be able to customize the contacts list screen.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Joanna Rose,I like the app a lot. Sometimes the group messaging lags but overall I'm pretty happy. I like the free trial and even after the ads aren't really a big deal. They aren't obtrusive. Really pleased with the app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Derrick Shaw,"I dont understand why this app doesnt have timestamps on messages sent and received. Edit: Thanks for the update, there is no option for that in the long hold, only in general settings which makes it so you dont get notified at all.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Miemie Sevilla-Zapata,I've been using this app for a long time yet suddenly on the last update whenever i open the app for my msgs. It keeps directing me to ads and take me to playstore everytime. it was really time consuming if i need to urgently reply to an sms. I got annoyed and unistalled the app. Hope you can do something about it.,3

No one answered my calls at Mood so I downloaded your app and TaDa! I am operating efficiently & quickly again! Plus becoming ad free is only $2.93 instead of Mood's insane $10.99. Your customization is fantastic, but more importantly, your SMS/MMS program is up to date & solid!",5

com.p1.chompsms,Vee,Been using Chomp for a couple of weeks now and have had no problems whatsoever. Really appreciate the app. The Android messenger was not functioning fully on my phone for some reason and ditto on Textra. I downloaded this because it's gotten consistently good reviews and seems to be living up to his reputation.,5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Best, customizable and fast. I'm fed up with my previous SMS app that keeps on hanging. Putting up with it despite a long delayed update was a big mistake. Surprised Chomp did its magic when I tried its features. Is there a pro version of this because I wanna support the developers?",5
com.p1.chompsms,rolo roam,UPDATE: I stopped using it long time ago. The big limitation I found is lack of swipe actions .. left and right swipe on the message. .I think it must be added. OLD REVIEW... Good dual SIM support and allows handing of sms /mms and configure behaviour.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Ian Chilvers,"I'm very happy with this app. Having a Hauwei P30 pro the standard SMS app is very basic so chose this one over a few others as the previous 3rd party app wasn't picked up by my smart watch whereas this was.

Come to find out, random messages were not coming through Chomp. Just opened my phones default app and there they all are. I also missed a text from a company for a job offer that I was looking forward to, thinking they ghosted me. Nope. Turns out Chomp is garbage and caused a lot of miscommunication and issues. Will never use again.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Nancy Mouton,Incredible and fast. Chomp is the only app that allows me to send as many pictures as I want. It has to compress them first but it never tells me that there's not enough space. Just download the app and make it your default messenger.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app, I used to use GoSms but they started charging and I found this app instead. and I have to say I love this one so much more. I love we can customize it with our own pictures, fonts and colors and you guys don't charge rediculous amounts of money to let us do it. 100% the best app out there for FREE customizations. Thank you so much!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Pretty good app. after Samsung's messaging app eliminated scheduled messages and signatures, this was the only app i could find which does both. plus there are lots of themes you can download to change the appearance.",4

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I love CHOMP SMS!!! I have used the default app that comes on the phone but have quickly switched back because of the various features that the others don't have... thank you for continuing to upgrade and stay relevant!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Scott Shiells,Worked great for months then all of a sudden I am unable to text pictures. The above was my original review of the app. I quickly got a response from the company and was able to rectify the issue. Great customer service.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Decent app. Biggest complaint is that when texting in a group it doesn't combine my responses and instead sends a text to every person. I have to back out of the group text and individually text people.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Patrish Kemp,I have used this app for less than two months...I felt like it was pretty awesome until my Credit Card number that I only have a digital copy of and gave to only my Pampered chef consultant for a purchase (my original form of payment account was hacked) was used for an international Netflix purchase. BE AWARE. I will not be downloading any other text messaging apps other than the one that came on my phone in the future. Sometimes the cute customizable apps will screw you.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Ian Chilvers,"Very happy with this app. Downloaded it as the standard app was poor and this one has loads of themes to play with and some good customisation. I don't usually buy apps, but I did this one to get rid of the ads and is well worth the money. Have contacted the Dev team a few times and found them very helpful and the replies prompt. Could wish for more really so will stick with this one for sure",5
com.p1.chompsms,Chris C,"Decided to buy pro several years ago because stock was so bad and never looked back. Bugs pop up every now but Chomp support has always been responsive and willing to help. Love everything about Chomp, from its support of using iOS emojis so I can communicate with people using Apple phones to the theming customization. I would however like to be able to use hex codes or something for custom theming colors. Overall great versatile messaging app. Response below from Chomp is from my old review.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Michelle L,"I really like the app. I love having the ability to change up the view of the app however I wish I could send a delayed delivery group mms message. It's not a make or break for me though, still love the app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Dorthy Pietrykowski,"This app is customizable, but more important the user can figure out how to customize it. Too many apps are too difficult to figure out how to use better. This one is much easier to get fugured out. Enjoy!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Melissa Rodgers,I enjoyed the ability to pin messages to the top to keep my most wanted texts at hand. But my biggest disappointment in this app is in receiving mass messages from unknown parties at all times of day and night with no way of truly blocking or being rid of the conversation. Many in these messages wish not to be bothered so they keep messaging to stop or use vulgar language and so I get pinged over and over again. I had hoped to find a service that preformed better than the ever glitchy messenger,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I paid for this app. It started as a good replacement of the default messaging app, but over time I've noticed and reported a few bugs. It doesn't look like the dev team is interested in working the bugs out. At this time, I wouldn't recommend this app, and I'm looking for a better alternative.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Just installed, so still test driving, but why do the themes require SD card to install in the app? That is very disappointing. *EDIT* restart of phone worked like a charm! TY so much for jumping on this ""problem"" and offering solution! Disappointment gone!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sonia D. Andras,"This is one of those apps that I'll keep reinstalling no matter what new phone I get. It's great, it looks, works and feels awesome! One thing, with all the spam and nefarious messages coming in, a spam filter and warning system would be stellar!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great, light weight and very customizable. The ad gets in the way every now and then but hey, it's free and it's not super intrusive. I do plan on paying for the premium version soon.",5
com.p1.chompsms,K KS,"Been using the paid version for my main phone for the past many many years. Highly recommended. Easy to use with many features. My favorite is delayed sending, for up to 10 seconds. Using this same app for this spare phone now. Thank you.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jessac Baird,Needed a messenger app that allowed signatures over SMS. Chomp SMS delivered and so much more. customizations all over. Lacking a few features like export but props to not auto-linking contacts by sms grouping! So when i text or call J the linking WON'T call K. And when J calls ir texts me it doesn't show as linked K. Probably just a Samsung problem but Chomp totally fixed it.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Toni Bowman,Switched because messages + kept hanging up. Messages would take 24 hrs to send. This app is great. Easy instructions to customize. Smooth operation. No hang ups. 4 instead of 5 because I would like to see a block feature for spam I upped the review to 5. they do have block feature. they replied with the block instruction great response time too,5
com.p1.chompsms,Don Craig,All is fine with the app. Lot of settings options available. Only problem is for several days it always says I have 1 new message wh whether I do or not and that is frustrating. No mark all read button. Can't find an answer in settings. 🤔,4
com.p1.chompsms,Glenda Fink,Well I can say with certainty that CHOMP IS WAY BETTER than Google messages. I have a Moto G Stylus 5G. In April Google made an update to messages. OMG IT screwed all my notifications up. There was no sound for incoming messages etc. I worked on it for 2 days. gave up and searched. found a techy article that mentioned this app. along with others (I downloaded 2 others which I deleted within 3 minutes of using) CHOMP WON! THANkS!! I'd like more spam resistance Maybe call/mess duo app!!!!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Mike C.,"So i came back to Chomp after handcent just wasn't cutting it with their overwrite free backup that does not work. I was hoping in Chomp on the missed text notification that you could put in your own reminder sound instead of just repeating the same chosen sound per contact, but no biggie.. I was going through all the themes. All those white people and black tommy all the way at the bottom. C'mon man!!!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love this app been using it for years. I love the layout and being able to customize the text colors, fonts, text bubbles and background to fit my personal likes. I like to change it for holidays too. Thank you.",5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Visually the most appealing and easiest msg app to use. Customisable interface, and is just a really enjoyable msg app. Simple but effective - I don't like apps with too much stuff, this does the trick. Very affordable too! Worth my dollars.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Yitzchak Gershovitz,"I like the app and use it for many years. However, yesterday I sent a credit card photo to a friend via text.

com.p1.chompsms,Verne Wright,"I want to like this app, but it keeps closing while using it... Will update if this gets better. Update, I am lowering my review due to inappropriate ads showing at top of app. I will uninstall this program. Update 12/17/20, after clearing the cache, then rebooting the phone, it is working better. Now 4 stars.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jacob Lynch,Good App Lacking Modern Features Though. I'm a paying member. But there is no read/received report to see if the other has received and read the message. I love customizable vibration patterns and the completely customizable look.,3
com.p1.chompsms,John Holliday,"I started using this app because it gave me control over which emoji set I use. There was no other reason. I HATE the default flat emojis; they are ugly as, well the poop emoji. ALL icons and emojis should be 3d with a good look to them. With that aside, Chomp needs to be able to increase screen size by simply dragging the screen in opposite directions. NOT just through themes. And, the emojis need to be BIGGER! These are defaults, not options or enhancements. Three stars until it gets better.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I downloded this app to be able to send videos to my friends but no matter what I do even when i put the mms on the largest or smallest size i cant even send a 5 second video without it telling me the video is too large. Other than that the app does what it is supposed to do. Edit for dev response: I dont really mind all that much that I cant send videos but one thing that really does matter to me is how you respond to your reveiws so fast unlike many others who dont respond at all. 4 stars,4
com.p1.chompsms,Justin Drakon,Great app! Great themes and customizations! All the options I was looking for. Only suggestion would be an option to group all unknown senders in a folder or something. I had the option once and loved it! Anyway thanks for a great app!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Minden Frances Pettengill,"Love the app. The depth of customization is incredible. Customer service is exceptional and quick to respond. I overlooked a notification setting, and they responded almost immediately and got me where I needed to be.",5
com.p1.chompsms,J H,"Edit - Silly me. User error. Thanks for helping me to sort this, Chomp! (Reviewed annoying splitting of messages but this was an option and I'd missed the settings for it. Response from developer sorted it out for me)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Matti Lonsinger,"10 stars!!! I can't say enough good things about this app! It has a counter on it so it tells you how many unread messages you have, it has a lot of personalization tools which make it fun. As a business owner I've tried lots of apps and now I have become accustomed to texting some of my clients their statements. Chomp allows you to create templates of words phrases sentences etc so you don't have to type them every time. So I'm able to add my PayPal link with just one touch of a template button",5
com.p1.chompsms,S1Mu DeltaVs,"My former messaging app was abandoned by the creator and I was never notified, and I found out B/C I started having issues with receiving text and photos. I tried several messaging apps. I tried CHOMP. I like most everything about it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Alan Ellias,Loves me my Chomp. This is my 3rd or 4th phone I've upgraded to that I've been using it on. So much more flexible than the in house texting app. Love all the theme choices and other oprions I can choose from. Its worth paying for the ads free version.,5
com.p1.chompsms,nijuken,pros: can send mms to email addresses. cons: can't keep the search results to move in and out. if you go one level in then hitting back cancels all the search results. also search results are not sorted by date.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Joanye Pitts,"I've been using chomp for 4 years., it is easy to install and easy to understand and use. I like it better than the messenger with the Android.

com.p1.chompsms,Marvin Barclay,"I am really enjoying this very competent app that does exactly what it should with many user uptions to customize for your personal needs or preferences. That said I wish it had (in addition to supporting duel sim), SIP for those of us who have VOIP messaging. It just would be so nice to have all my messaging in one place. This is the one and only reason for only 4 stars. Thank you Chomp!",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I had been using ""Messenger"" for most all of my daily needs. It served its purpose, that's all I could say about it. But I started to have the need to send photos with my billing, at first it was 1 or 2 photos. But now its 15 or 20 photos per invoice' sometimes 5 or 7 times a day. So I went through a rough period not being able to comply with the invoicing needs. That is until I found Chomp.SMS. Now I can take as many photos as I need without the worries of ""will I get paid?",5

com.p1.chompsms,Jeanine Keener,"I have had this app for a LONG time, & it has ALWAYS performed wonderfully, but for the past few weeks, almost every text I send either takes foever to see the green checkmark that shows it was sent, or displays the red exclaimation point.

com.p1.chompsms,Geline S. Sandoval,Great app. I just hope that the transitions of sending messages became smooth. I wanna suggest that the timestamps maybe placed beside the messages to minimize the entire conversation. More great updates to come.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Dean Botsaris,"I've been using CHOMP(paid) for YEARS. Since the original Google G1 phone in 2008. It's pretty great. Some small things here and there, but definitely better than any stock messages apps. I wish in the Android drop down notification, it would show the entire message and not just the first line.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,This app really beats the stock android messages app. The main feature I like is the pop up alert that lets you respond to texts without opening the app. I also like the ability to set a send delay on messages.,5

com.p1.chompsms,Ron Mucci,"We love using this app. It is very easy to navigate. However, it would a game changer if you had a trash bin set up for in case you delete a message by mistake or in the heat of the moment. Let us know if an update is coming down the line. Thanks so much.",5
com.p1.chompsms,CoreyHowe63,I was having a lot of problems with the native app on the phone not sending things. I installed this one and it works perfect! Only problem is there's the odd little ad at the top of my conversation list. No big deal.,4

com.p1.chompsms,David Noe,This is badass! The very best texting app! No one even comes close to it. Lets you set it up however you want it. Even blocks all the texts you don't want. For like two dollars you won't have any ads on it for a life time. Now I been using for 3 months now and I love it even more!!!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Sharon Atterbury,"I give it a 4 because 1) it was the only app I could find that worked with my Moto G Plus phone. I couldn't get the other app that I was previously using. 2) I like the nice, bright color coding; 3) it notes text from people; and 4) auto text from marketers. I'm more than happy to give it a 5 if it could what the other app is doing that I donwloaded to be able to send my text via my laptop. I live on my laptop, not my cell phone. Laptop works best for my hand coordination when typing as opposed to texting.",4

com.p1.chompsms,Bob Hohlman,Switched over to Chomp because of intermittent problems I had receiving messages using Google messenger. Chomp seems to work for me without any glitches. The only difference I have noted compared to Messenger is that I cannot zoom on photos that are included in messages.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"PRO User for years. One text the app didn't like and it's toast. Tried troubleshooting (apparently only one option to troubleshoot) and was told to use Textra instead, which is riddled with ads. Bye Chomp.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Cindy S,I was not able to be on a large group text - over 10 people. Someone told me to download an app to complete this. This app did not work but chomp does. You have to go on chomp always before every text - but got used to.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Ace,"Pretty good app as far as MSM apps go, although i would like the ability to see media that I've shared or received I'm messages. I also feel like I've gotten more spam texts from unknown numbers/botts which is a bit concerning.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Stacy Reece,"I don't mind the adds, but being right at the top I click it sometimes by accident. I don't like not being able to swipe left or right to Delete. Other than those two things I am Happy with It.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,SO FAR SO GOOD Takes a bit to get use to since I've never changed my default messenger app ever and old habits are hard to break . Nonetheless its very easy to use just like it says and my favorite features are the ability to lock a message and backing up all messages everyday .,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Does everything you would expect plus you can edit themes to your own taste. One thing lacking, which I would use; the ability to zoom the text when reading messages. Still happy to award 5 stars though.",5
com.p1.chompsms,reni gade,"Awesome! Worth the $ to banish ads. Looks much better than standard app. Android will make you choose Chomp every time you turn phone on, which is slightly noisome (not a chomp issue, I get that) & sometimes emotions don't show up [X] but overall this was well worth 3 bux to me. Thanks!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Chomp is a very good messaging app that I like much better than any base Android messenger. I gave 4/5 stars because when you change phones there is not an easy or convient way to retrieve your conversations effectively. I would hope that an app this amazing would have a way to do this within it. I highly recommend it to anyone.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Devansh Gupta,"The interface could be more better and modern, and there should be improvement in black theme, kind of more premium look. I wanted a SMS app which is more fast and better than pre-installed SMS app, and most important PLEASE DO IMPROVEMENT IN UI. Overall good app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Really like the app, would of given it 5 stars, but unfortunately, recently I can't delete messages, been it touch with them, they told me what to do, still didn't work, was asked to screen record problem, did that, and haven't heard anything from them since, still can't delete messages, thinking of changing app",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I have paid for the add free sms and been using this since my note 2. For some reason you guys have changed the auto correct and even when I spell the correct word its automatically changing my words. seriously tired of dealing with this for something I've paid for.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Margaret Shoemaker,I like using chomp I like the fact that I can reply in group text over 10. My samsung will only allow groups of 10 on group texts. Now I can use chomp for my job and reply to my boss if need be in group text. I also like the emoji ideas that chomp has. Give it 5 stars. I do have ads at top but that doesn't bother me. Thank you Margaret 😊,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Decent app, love the extra layer of security that's included, the adds can sometimes slow it down on a slow phone, but that's the price of free. Overall it's well worth the price and better than the factory included app",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Been using Chomp for 2yrs and liked it a lot. For the past 3 months, intermittently it will not send texts. I go back to stock text app and works fine. Phone is Samsung Galaxy 10+. Very frustrating.",2
com.p1.chompsms,christina douthitt,I like this app and I'll keep using it I only have one thing I don't like is that I can't seam to find a way to in large my text. But I've gotten use to it. However if you can fix that it would make things easier for me and other people who wears bifocal glasses. I just know at night my glasses feel heavy on my face and I would like to take them off but I can't because of the small print. Can you fix that.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Karen Celleza,"This app is superb. It's easy to customized EVERYTHING, yes everything that you want to change/customize you can do it with this app. From backgrounds, font style, font colors! Everything. I've been looking for app like this and This is perfect. I highly recommend thisss app❤️❤️❤️",5
com.p1.chompsms,David Pfaff,Until today this was a good app. Now suddenly any photo I take via chomp for texting looks horrible. And it's only in chomp. I can take photos and attach them and they are fine. Time to find a new message app,1
com.p1.chompsms,Rob Burk,Great app. Solves many issues i had with original s6 app. Would be nice if one could mute an individual conversation though. (Like when someone group texts and it goes on and on and on and on...... and you don't care),5
com.p1.chompsms,Chris Layzell,"Works well. One small add on top of the messages. Not a problem. I can now receive pictures with texts. Had to reduce the size of pictures, but quality is still fine.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Madison Grey Cory,"I've been using it for years. When I get a new phone, this is what I download for my default text messaging app. Love the customization and that it's dependable. This app has been installed on about 7 or 8 phones now. If it's love, why look for the 2nd best thing?",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using this app for several years and overall it works great. However, for the past several months or so I've no longer been able to use the search function to search through all the text messages. Would like to try be able to fix this if possible.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I literally downloaded every single text app so I'd be able to send and receive MMS and none of them work for me. Even though my apn settings are correct, nothing works. It's a great app but I was mislead thinking this would solve my problem 😞",2
com.p1.chompsms,A H,"I'm not sure why I never used this app before, but I'm loving it so far. No Ads!!! Customization options even with the emojis to support older devices so you won't miss out. & just a smooth - easy interface!",4
com.p1.chompsms,TIM Lordan,Started using Chomp when my default SMS app started glitching. So far it's been pretty good. I have the ad-free version so I can't speak to whether the free version gets annoying once ads kick in.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Fox MacDonald,I've been using this app for years and just upgraded. The scheduled message feature is invaluable for me so I don't forget to send birthday wishes to people. And being able to tweak everything to get it how I like it is great.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Very intuitive and highly functional texting app. Significantly better than the Samsung pre-loaded one. I've yet to have an issue with it. Overall excellent.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Michael Menna,A very good alternative to the stock Samsung texting app. I love the fact that you can configure it anyway you want. Pretty flexible. And anytime there seems to be an issue the team seems to address it quickly.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Bill Bale,"I find this app to live up to the description here. It's better than the other SMS I've tried, most especially the stock Android. Ads are annoying as ads usual. I never use them as you never really know where the link is sending you to.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Telephone numbers are not showing up in the list view! I've changed font sizes to see if that helps but all I get is three dots. * Updated 6 Nov 19 * issue only affects imported old sms messages. New messages are displayed okay.,5
com.p1.chompsms,DickButt,"So far the best messaging app I've used for Android. Has pretty much everything customizable, which I wanted compared to Google messenger that doesn't have any real customization. Go sms is a close distant second if it wasn't for their security issues.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Kat Henry,Love this txt . app only one reason for not 5 star is you can't customize conversation for each contact. So the hearts I have for my husband has to be for everyone. I came here from using Handcent while it was down for a few days I have never used any other but handcent . Chomp I am sticking with because I see more themes and I think it is faster . So I paid for no ads if I could at least do a different background for each contact 5 stars it would be its almost perfect .,4
com.p1.chompsms,Kerem Holland,Very customizable while still being easy to use. The one issue I have is it would be great if different people on a group text had different color text bubbles.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great app, been using it for years. Loads to customize to make it personal to u. Great idea of a time delay. Write a txt one day or nite set the date and time to be sent. Send a txt to yourself for the next date to remind u of an appointment or someone birthday. When I upgrade my mob this is one of the first things I setup. Great app wouldn't be without it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Natalie Ned,I Like It Alot!!! the app is easy to use. just wish each contact could have their own sound notification. UPDATE!! I did as suggested. All my frequently used contacts have a certain SMS tone. Now I know who texting me. Thanks!!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Alicia Place,"I have been using this app for almost 6 years, however recently I'm not getting all my messages. On occasion I check the default messaging app and there are several texts I didn't receive on the chomp app. I LOVE chomp, but I've uninstalled because I need to receive ALL my messages.",4
com.p1.chompsms,rika jheidi,"so i've installed it. Its very Nice .. but I have 2 things to Concern. 1st, I can't seem to Apply the notification Sound no matter how i try. , its not so Friendly coz' im taking too Long to reply Not knowing that I already had a message. 2nd, sometimes i can't Recieve messages. 😣 What's going on.. i really Like the simplicity of this messaging app.. please Fix it",2
com.p1.chompsms,Sandra Lynne,"I really like this app. It would be nice to increase the font size. It is very small and at times very difficult to read. Another feature that would be nice, is the option to use a pic from my gallery as a background for the app or messages.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Overall, very good! Shortcoming is that it doesn't give access to different photo programs (e.g.. Gallary, Cloud, etc.) when trying to attach photos in alternate locations.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Mike Ezekiel,"I have always loved this SMS App, it has never given me problems in the past. I'm excited about RCS though. So, I decided to use the Google Messages on my new Pixel 5A in anticipation. The app is ok, but Chomp SMS is leaps and bounds ahead of it IMO. Anyway... I got tired of waiting for my family's Samsung Messages (on their phones) to be able to use RCS (app + carrier) thus allowing us to all use RCS. I just don't see anything happening, so I decided to return to the best... Chomp SMS.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Debra Bunker,Awesome app if your looking to personalize ur messaging app this is the one to get. I love it. Depending on my moods I can change it up or down. I love the preset messages you can send to people on a daily or weekly send it AWESOME 😎 THANKS FOR MAKING IT AND KEEP ADDING MORE DESIGNS AND STYLES!!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Sheila Beckham,I absolutely love this app and the way it works so many choices in backgrounds. I highly recommend it to everyone.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Lindsey Seedall,"Was working great. Send an email to customer service and have not heard back. Messages sometimes send. When I receive a message, I am not being notified. All of settings are correct.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Overcame the problems I had with Huawei app. Excellent and can now send and receive MMS Messages without any issues. New phone LG V40 had problems sending photos and some other niggles. Installed Chomp and once again my life is now hassle free. I am so happy with the app I will pay the very reasonable price to upgrade to pro.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,There's no pop up box or bubble showing if I have a new message. There's also nothing on the notifications bar. There's no ringtone as well even though my ringtone is all set up. I usually miss my messages because of this app.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Rayven Gardner,I love all the emoticons how fast it is and the many themes,5
com.p1.chompsms,Mytai Darlyne,Only thing That would make this app better is to be able to personalize background for individual chats also.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Have tried other texting programs. Some others may have some more features (that I'll never use). Chomp is the most feature rich and user friendly texting app on the market. Best interface in my opinion.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Walter Humphrey,This app has been a great experience for me. It even allows me to put my signature on each sent message which was not able to do before. Pictures as well as messages come through and go out with much clarity. Thank you chomp SMS for your services.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Mohamed Mansouri,I like the interface of the app and the pop up window for the new text message.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Derek Jay,"My favorite texting app, the customization is great. Had to switch off it when I got a group text and realized there's no way to mute notifications for them. Hope it gets fixed soon.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Emarie Qantaqua,"Missed MULTIPLE messages - Had to uninstall. I really wanted to like this app. Actually, I did really like the app. I loved the customization and really - most things about it. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting all my messages and it's not an option for me to miss so much ... So I had to uninstall. Bummer.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Whuptushi,Better than mood for dual sim. Was using mood but a recent upgrade made it v glitchy. Chop works great.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"so far in the past couple weeks I have not had any problems I would like it if it had a ""received and/or read"" notification but I switched from my default messenger because I wasn't getting my text notifications and I didn't have as many options and with chomp sms everything works perfectly",5
com.p1.chompsms,Linda Miller,You never have any problems with sending pictures or text to anybody I've never had a problem sending a picture or a text to anyone my text always goes straight through c h o m p s is it for sending messages I don't use the message send that came with the phone with my Android I don't use their message they're text message. If you want to get a message to somebody ASAP Champs is the one message apps that will do that for you want to get a picture to somebody ASAP its there just awesome.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like the app overall but one main glitch, when u start typing in a name to find them to send a message you have to get to 4 letters before it pulls up the people, it would be great if u could type b and all the b names would come up , and bj and all the bj names would show and so on, if I find a app that has all the features I want without this glitch I will switch.",3
com.p1.chompsms,TheRoninKhajiit,Love it but REALLY want to have the option to open a conversation and do a search for keywords to find previous messages quickly. Part of my profession involves relying on past conversations for accountability so for me this feature would be an outstanding addition.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Nice text app. You can change the themes too. It's as fast as the standard messaging app that comes with the S10e. They also fix errors in updates very quickly and communicates with you fast.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Amberly Terrill,"Honestly I feel this is the best messaging app, the way you can personalize everything about it right down to the style of emojis and the conversation background, worth paying for the no ads. Ive had this app for years and over several phones, no complaints 👍👍👍",5
com.p1.chompsms,Mike Spruce,"Excellent app. Lots of useful customisations possible. Will be upgrading to the pro version to lose the ads, which are not intrusive and are not popping up constantly.. (Other developers please note!)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Heather Farnsworth,"I gave 3 stars because I really like the features such as scheduling recurring texts and getting themes, however the app crashes a lot when I try to scroll down my messages list making it very difficult to contact most people.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Kevin Copenhaver,Scheduled messages work correctly and I enjoy being able to customize every aspect of my theme. I paid for the full version so not sure on the ads but it's like $3 so if you like it just buy it.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Very easy to use and simple. I hope theres more update for customizing the theme. Love it and the the schedule messages its great! especially if your too much busy to remember things through messages. Recommended sms app out there.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Sue Calicchia,It's an easy to use texting app I just can't figure out how to send a group message and have the replies come only to me. Also can't send videos which frustrated me. Hopefully these options will come soon.,3

com.p1.chompsms,Grace Ramos,"This is a super awesome messenger app! It's user friendly, attractive and so easy to type the composed messages. I am so happy to have found this app. No problems and the best I've discovered hands down. Love the experience! Thank you, Chomp team!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Catheryne Duckworth,"Supportive Tech Team! Had an issue with MMS after updating, contacted support, they responded quickly and help remedy the situation! - now im hoping they can create an app for the galaxy watch 3 so that I can get messages on my watch. Right now I can only receive messages on my watch if I use the stock app- which I'm not a fan of... So here's hoping to a watch app soon!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Paula Mitchell,Works great. You can set up convo list and conversations with your own pics. You can use your own music as ringer and you can set individual contact ringer. Thanks. This is a great app,5
com.p1.chompsms,Karen Kellersberger,"I love chomp! I always tell everyone about it! I love being able to customize the look, the colors, the fonts, etc. The very best part is the option to schedule a text for later. It's awesome!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have bought the Pro version but then found an annoying feature. My Samsung native app stays in the conversation that I was in when you exit and when you go back in. This app though always goes back to the main menu, annoying so uninstalled",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"UPDATE! AGAIN! With all those glowing reviews, everyone is RIGHT! I've been using this for awhile and love it. Unlike it's brother Textra i don't have the plus panel problem with ChompSMS. I require different ringtones for each contact and Chomp does it like a champ. I'd never use anything else for SMS message app! And the $2+ is cheap for life use. UPDATE: I had a small problem and the dev is so nice and polite. It was my fault and they nicely told me how to do it! A1 service! #1 company!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Best text app I've ever used. But since the most recent Android update (I have 10) the quick response stopped working altogether and it's really killed a lot of the love I had for this app. Can we get a fix???

com.p1.chompsms,Darlene Canniff,Best app like this that I have tried so far ... Totally enjoy it!! Update today and chomp is no longer working correctly ... May have to uninstall ... Chomp to the rescue ... Sent instructions to fix the problem & working great again ... Thank you!! Excellent customer service!!!!,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very good, clean and customizable. It only gets 3 stars because the mms was jumpy when scrolling. Issue did not end after reinstall. I emailed support already and that's what they told me to do.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love it but I have discovered a serious bug. If a text comes in from an unknown number, it will sometimes assign it's as coming from the same number as the most recent other text. So if you got a text from John, and then get a text from an unknown number oh, it will say that it's John. It will be in a separate conversation so you will have two conversations with the same name.",5

com.p1.chompsms,Holly Runyan,Wow! I just downloaded this yesterday and I'm amazed at the level of customization offered! I'm picky about what I want and this is looking perfect for me.

com.p1.chompsms,Martha Sanders,"Love this app! No issues at all. You can customize the look of everything for free,which is awsome! So give it a try. Theres also no annoying adds like most apps, also which is great. Good jon guys keep up the amazing job.",5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I was fool enough to pay for this awful app, you cannot even, as far as I can see, set convo to list style, money wasted. Plus when you set as default it only shows some contacts and lots of messages are missing.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,After testing multiple texting apps I chose Chomp. I have been using it for years now. I recently had a problem with the app after my phone did a software update. The Chomp team responded to my question on the same day and helped me resolve the problem. I highly recommend this app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Oren B.,"Excellent alternative to the built in SMS application. Specifically the ability to blacklist senders that hide their numbers is very useful. Also, the Chomp support team is very responsive and helpful.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Ive been looking for an app like this for years. When i intalled it i didn't think i was going to go premium, but it was totally worth it. I havent seen any bugs yet, and i really enjoy the fact that i can customize just about everything!",5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"If you're searching for a way to send bigger files and text this app is a delicious piece of S#@T!!!! An extended waste of time to find out, if like me you were trying to send a message at the present time. Nothing more frustrating 😠! Save your time",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Mostly very good but I cannot see the menu option for blacklisting when I long-press a message. I really need this feature but it doesn't seem to be available. This could be 5 stars if I had that.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Janelle Freeman,Love this app to death! the customization is so good!!! my only current issue is that it doesn't seem to font scan properly? its missing the 'all files' permission and only has Media file permissions I think. either way it's unfortunate bc I miss my more flowy fony,4

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"It's a very good program especially for setting up group text. My only dislike is that if your group message is a little long , Chomp will send 4-5 messages out then it will continuously stat asking for you to allow all remaining messages to be sent.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love this app. it is fantastic, its material theme, its nice emojis.

Also, the popups are visible even on lock scrwen, not good. please check on that",4

com.p1.chompsms,Bradley Goldberg,"Went from 5 stars to 3.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Purchased this app awhile ago and really like many of its features. Until today when I got caught up in a 13-way conversation with some people I didn't know.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I started using Chomp because the message app on my Samsung phone was sending duplicate texts to my friends with iPhones. The app works great and I like it better than the preinstalled one. It was very quick to install and start using.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,THEMES - So far I'm loving this app. My only complaint is when I try to download a theme it tells me fail to save to the SD card. The problem is I have a Samsung Note 8 and it doesn't have an SD card. Can that be fixed? I really would like to add a theme. Thank you!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Joe “Joey” ********,Great app! Could set reminders when you miss a message which I'm used to but my new phone didn't give the option. A lot of backgrounds to choose from also which is great. Highly recommend,5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Been using it for several years and it does a good job. Works well for sending and receiving texts. I probably only use a small portion of its abilities. If you are looking for something different than the standard text message program try it out.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Like a breath of fresh air. Paid for a licence. Bargain. Got a pretty UI. And escaped the daft decisions the default SMS made about what numbers should be my favourites.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using Chomp for at least 6 years now, and I love it! I'm legally blind, and Chomp allows me to customize the entire app, which enables me to create themes that are ideal for my visual condition! I also love the quick reply pop-up option!",5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"WAY too many ads. yes I know these apps have them but I felt bombarded. What's the point of a review if I'm being asked to just change it, this now just feels like I have to change it. I appreciate the feedback but know that the add placement truly looks like you have a new message everytime I open the app. I guess here's your new 3 star rating. Makes me wonder what people really think about thier product choices when a review is just asked to be changed.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Rue U,Was a great app in it's heyday (except for one phone i had where it wouldnt send messages when i hit send). These days it looks like theyve run out of ideas and every update is kinda nothing innovative. Also they never fill out their changelogs properly. Today I use Messages by Google mostly and it's sad because i hate and try to avoid additional Google products than necrssary but Messages is too good.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Stabbb 129,I changed over from Signal to CHOMP mainly because Signal had no scheduling option. Chomp is not a secure app but has some great options to customize. Support staff is very responsive to suggestions...,4

com.p1.chompsms,JD,The installed phone app I had was pretty basic so I started using chomp. I am very pleased. Lots of features: one of the best is blocking spam texts. I like it so much I will buy the no ad version. And I seldom buy android apps. Good Job chomp!,5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Works ok. My biggest complaint is an ad always opens up in the spot where your latest message is. If you fail to wait a few seconds you open the ad by accident.,3

It does not do this on chomp so well happy. So to round up all happy so far no complaints Recommended.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,The SMS App works nicely. Best what I have found so far. One reservation: why is chomp sms listed as adware by Adaway? com.p1.chompsms?

com.p1.chompsms,Bob Belbeck,I have used chomp for years. But suddenly I cannot block numbers from an abusive conversation. The reason I got chomp was so I could block spam numbers. Without the ability to block conversations or manually enter numbers the app is worthless to me.,1

If you would add 4 more functions (see them below) to your ""Chomp SMS"" you would become a trully leader in this kind of business, and you will beat ""YAATA"" and ""Go SMS"" (and other major competitors as well) for good! I honestly don't get how come you didn't implement these functions so far, because these are trully a ""must have"" functions in these times! These functions I am referring to are:  1. Add ""mark this message as unread"" function, because I might read it when I receive it, but I need to mark it as unread, as a reminder, to reply to it later, because I don't have time to reply it as soon as arrives.  2. Add ""make this message (or messages) private"" function to be able to move them in a private ""box"" (section) for not be seeing by others, but by the owner only. This ""private"" section must have a PIN option to unlock it, for the private messages to become visible as well.  3. Add ""archive this message (or all)"" for being able to archive them, not only to delete them or move them in ""blacklist"" or ""private"" sections..  4. Add ""select one or more/all message/s"" function to be able to select wich message/s go to ""private section"" or to ""archive section"".  PLEASE DO THAT!",4

com.p1.chompsms,Dionisis Falireas,The best SMS application by far!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Tank Connors,Gifs don't send for some reason? Is there a fix?,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very customizable but the led color won't change from green, in the notification section. I selected other colors & ""none"" but the change won't save. Otherwise world give it 5 stars. Running Oreo 8,0 on a S7",3
com.p1.chompsms,Randy Gibson,Would be a great app if I could send pictures through it. Any pictures I take with my phone are fine but anything I have saved like from fb & what have you won't send even though they're a smaller file size.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Brian Drew,"Tried a few over the years but none fit the bill till Chomp. Fast, free, simple yet comprehensive, options galore, and most importantly... customer service extraordinaire. Only downside is my reason for 4 vs 5 stars: no archive feature. Go for it!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Mary Margret Bransford,"I've been using Chomp SMS for a good 6 or 7 years now. If you are looking for a diverse messaging service,with Chomps SMS,you will absolutely not be disappointed. They provide everything that you want and will ever need when it comes to a variety of themes,texting advantages,and they provide the best service overall.

com.p1.chompsms,Shawn Brown,Love this message app. I have an Android phone and default message app was not syncing well with messages from iphone. Don't have this problem with Chomp. Works great!,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like this texting app. It's user friendly, versatile (lots of fun custom features), can easily use stickers and gifs, colors, fonts, etc. The best of many I tried!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Mike Louaillier,"OUTSTANDING!! 100% reliable, powerful, great features. I use it as a calendar too, with scheduled messages. I send liinks, photos, easy peazy!",5
com.p1.chompsms,david gillen,I finally started shopping around for a better app than Google's default messaging app. after trying a couple I landed on Chomp and Love it :) the customization is superb and I don't really mind the ads in the free version,5
com.p1.chompsms,Tanvi Bedekar,"Ay, I'm sorry. I restarted my phone and tried chomp again and it worked so it's a me-not-you problem. I think my sim card just doesn't work though so I can't properly review your app. That's why I was looking for other messenger app. But it turns out it does it's just google's messenger app not working, so thanks chomp!",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Not bad, like the customizations, still getting used to it, just use for light texting, mms works well, the only thing that's ever bugged me with any text app is there's no way to tell if they've missed an incoming text or not",4
com.p1.chompsms,Greg O'Brien,Both the app as well as customer service is horrendous. No native scaling support for videos and no RCS features. Paying for the 'pro' was the worst decision I have made in a while. Stay away from this joke of an app (unless you miss the SMS functionality of a StarTac phone),1
com.p1.chompsms,MC MAC,"Great app. One feature that i would add is the ability to blocklist a group text. A few scams have come through as group texts and it's nice to mute, but i want to block.",4
com.p1.chompsms,chelz patty,"I love chomp I was using Handcent for over 20 years I guess I'll be using chomp that long now not too crazy about the ads at the top, Handcent was a bit different but I guess I can live with it also I hope you guys change the pop up feature really aren't many choices for colors and the bubble styles, I can't send my big emojis through it I have to close it out thanks",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jody Patterson,"I love this app overall, but the loss of a star is because I cannot figure out how to attach an audio file of my own making. When I go to ""Audio,"" it gives me a list of my ringtones. Maybe there's a secret way?",4
com.p1.chompsms,Kashishimoto Howard,"Cannot say anything bad about this ap. I like the customizable features that my previous phones didn't have with their included text systems. I'm on my 3rd phone, and won't use anything else.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Slumber Foxie,"Hi chomp team, rereviewing my older one. 1st, STILL SAME EVEN 2021 many of us read SMS or OTP via notifications itself but with yours ONE CANT VIEW WHOLE MESSAGE WITHIN NOTIFICATION ITSELF (SEE G MESSAGES, PULSE MI MESS). 2nd, STILL NO OPTION FOR SPAM FILTER (I get a great deal of those), & back-up or export or import on or from cloud or offline. Please add caller app , call receiver screen, dialer & management app so that I can use your by replacing Truecaller & signal. NOTHING IMPROVED. 👎",1
com.p1.chompsms,Toney DJ ToneyStone Burgan,Outstanding text app. Love the feature where you can get a pop-up display text without opening the actual text.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,it's a great app I use it my son use it had it for a really long time I love the features where you can personalize your text messages etc the only thing that would make it better is if we could set a signature for each contact,5
com.p1.chompsms,Dino Morelli,List view shows first message instead of most recent. Couldn't figure out if there is an Archive to store convos.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Raymond Bear,It's alright except for the fact I figured my children's mom was being ignorant by ignoring my text messages for days. Then she texts back that I been ignoring her. And sent screen shot. I never got those messages 😤. They never came in on my cell... so deactivated till this gets fixed. Almost caused a fight between us 😡,3
com.p1.chompsms,R S,Love the blocking feature that saves blocked texts to be retrieved later. Plus the app has a delay feature before sending. Needed feature auto compression on images.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Margaret Kathol,"It's pretty good, but after a while there is ads (they aren't intrusive) and you can't really personalize anything. Otherwise it's a good messaging app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Brandi Weaver,I've been using chomp for years. It's very customizable in every way that I've seen. The only thing I wish it had was more fonts to choose from. Other then that absolutely no complaints. Great job Chomp,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Love the app overall its fantastic and beautiful personalizing individual tones and the themes and all that but the biggest issue is the inability to have the app auto delete after x number of messages received therefore slowing down my phone and app and hogging so much space with for me over 80k messages please fix this asap all other SMS platforms have this feature why does Chomp not,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,It's an ok text app. It doesn't auto correct very well and the ads drives me crazy because I constantly click it accidentally. Doesnt show when someone is typing you a message.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Anthony Ramirez,"It has ads but it works well, has some extra easy to use features and the default Google texting app just doesn't work on my device but Chomp sure does! Keep up great work Chomp!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Ok since the developer was nice enough to say thanks, I'll elaborate a bit. I've been through a multitude of message apps and they've all sucked. I discovered chomp about 6 months ago and not only does it not suck, it does everything right! I highly recommend this app! You're Welcome 😊",5
com.p1.chompsms,Isha,I love this app. It's very easy to use and it's more colorful than the default messaging app. My only complaint is that there is no ability to name group chats. I hope this feature gets added in soon.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Charles Barnett,"I really love Chomp and I am a premium user, it worked great on my LG Xpression Plus 3 that runs Android 10 through AT&T Pre-Paid, however I recently upgraded to a 5G phone the AT&T Radiant Max 5G that runs Android 11. I downloaded Chomp and was all set to use it as my default messaging app but I found that every time I restart my phone, the default messaging app is set back to the app that came with the phone and I have to reset Chomp as my default messaging app. I have tried other Messaging apps and this doesn't happen with Pulse SMS+, and I am not sure if it happens with other SMS apps either. is there a way to get this fixed because I really love Chomp and there is a subscription fee to use Pulse and get all of the features. It would be awesome if this can be fixed.",5
com.p1.chompsms,J J,Wished that it could send a delayed MMS message with attachment. Still it's a great app to have when your phone needs THIS PERFECT app! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Waiting for your version of the tap tap app (off/on).,5
com.p1.chompsms,Chad Everett,For some odd reason I can no longer send GIFs within this app. It's worked for the longest time and now suddenly it doesn't. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail. Help me out!,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I know the odd advert pops up but I don't find them obtrusive and I know I have the option of a reasonable one off payment to stop them should they start to annoy me. All in all I like the flexibility and the fact that I can customise the app to my taste,5
com.p1.chompsms,Jenni,For the most part its a great app. My only tidbit complaint is the ability to block spam texts from coming through and being able to reply to grocery pickups those won't go through...,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I used to loved this app (love it enough to but pro) but now I hate it . My group messages were either delayed or not received at all. Picture was delayed by days !! It caused me a lot of problem with work since I keep missing important text messages.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Brian Hatherly,"Love this app! Great ""theme it"" options. Will easily give 5 stars when there an opportunity to set a maximum number of messages saved-as I have been using now for quite a few years. Incorporating my avatar (bitmoji) would be pretty cool too. Best message app so far!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Lisa Beth,I like the app a lot. It's been free of glitches and easy to use. I enjoy customizing there look I have a suggestion: I'd like to be able to name my group texts.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Vince Ott,Its a nice messaging service. I was hoping to be able to delete multiple messages at once. Among other things . Not paying fpr a premium service and dont like the drop down ads.,4
com.p1.chompsms,K. C.,"I don't really like the ads however, they're at the top and they're small, so it's very manageable. Lots of great features for sending large files/ pics. Love it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Danielle Fani,"Installed Chomp because of issues with the previous app I was using. And looking at reviews if previous app someone had mentioned Chomp & how customizable it is. I am able to do a general customization, but to have individual themes & different notifications for different people, it doesn't let me 😕. Would like to figure out how to do this",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Good alternative to standard SMS app. Allows square contact image and a little bigger than standard. Wouldn't mind seeing an option for a little larger contact pic though.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,the reason am not given 5 starts is because of the adverts in it. otherwise it's quite a nice messaging app. and also I would love to be able to lock a particular message and not the entire app if a choose to.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Aitch Em,This app is user friendly and reliable. I am no longer missing any of my texts. Its very user friendly and super simple. It would be nice to be able to customize the look of it a bit but that's not the end of the world. I recommend this app!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Aaron MacDonough,"Love Chomp. The personalisation you can give it is second to none. I like to use a unique style, and it's customisation settings allow you to be very specific. Spend the couple of bucks and get the Pro version, it's very worth it",5
com.p1.chompsms,Ashley Diggins,"So far so good in general but I keep getting failed MSM messages texts, like almost every day when I'm not trying to send or receive any.. The ads don't disturb me atall so that's a plus.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Shafiq Mumani,I've tried many SMS/Text apps and Chomp is my favourite. I used GOSMS and Mood Messenger but Chomp is much better. You can customise pretty much anything useful and like the delayed message sending features. Saved me a few potentially embarrassing moments!,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Nice app. I just dont like your idea of placing the dual sim number inside the conversation bubble. It doesnt look good in there. Kindly change that feature. Thanks.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Fine until ads...why would you put ads at the top of the message interface? That's a sure way of losing daily users. I understand revenue, but if ads are placed where the first message should be it is clearly deceiving for the user and false ad clicks increase.",2
com.p1.chompsms,David DangerDanger,"Best SMS app, fully customizable! These days, Android seems to think we want it to force us to use apps that are less and less customizable with every update, and that we want everything to look like an Apple product. They are dumb dumbs, clearly. Chomp is awesome, try it out!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Kate D,Works well for me. Free version started displaying ads after a few weeks. Better than texting with Google Voice but added customization would make it friendlier.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"you can set notification reminders if you have missed a text or have not heard your text tone,i set mine to repeat every 5 mins untill i read it,thats my main reason for using chomp,work in noisey enviroment so ideal for me.",5
com.p1.chompsms,John Fallon,"so much better than the default installed app. For people confused or bad at texting, this really makes texting more fun and easier to follow along with the dreaded group texts.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have been using the chomp app for about 3-4 years and I love, love, love it! My coworker recommended it to me after I purchased a new phone and whenever I get a new phone, chomp is the first app I download. I especially love how I can customize the theme. So far I have not had ANY problems with the app. Keep up the good work guys!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Best messaging app ever ,would be lost without it now . You can use your favorite pictures and favourite colours ,choose the size of your writing and completely make it unique to you A+++++++",5
com.p1.chompsms,kevin francs,Great app. One thing i really like about it is whenever I get a new phone and reinstall chomp all my text messages from my old phone are there. So I save a lot of links I wanna keep by just texting myself whatever I wanna save and I will always have.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Joann Vigil,AWESOME app much better then the one that came on my phone I love it,5
com.p1.chompsms,Dacha,"I used Textra which is also good app but it's not stable on my phone, crashing etc. But Chomp is my favorite sms app now. Simple interface with many options and what's more important - it's stable. Excelent 👌👍",5
com.p1.chompsms,Evan Deane,"Perfect except for lacking the option to turn on read status (where it shows whether a message has been read or just delivered) and external video player support (or just video support in general), will increase to 5 stars if that is added",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"after an uninstall.. and a re-install.. all is well.. love this app, why? simply put... send a .gif bigger than the bs limited by Australian standards.. I can now send a full animated gif and the receiver gets all the frames as opposed to 2 frames rubbish..",5
com.p1.chompsms,vince baildham,"Still going good, Long ago i had probs on my LG . I tried Textra.. instead ,,, it messed up a lot, Went back to Chomp NP since",5

Works just as well on Samsung S4 64gb tablet.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jeff Flannigain,Been using for about three years and I love the customizations you can do with backgrounds and such. Much more user friendly than Messages. Highly recommend the premium version!,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I found this to be the best after market message app. The themes aren't too difficult to customize and the features included cover everything that matters most to me.,4
com.p1.chompsms,First Name,Works great have been using this app for years now. Paid for the ad removal several years ago when first downloaded and I've been able to continue to use the paid ad free version on all new phones I've transfered my data over to 👌,5
com.p1.chompsms,Greg Linkous,Only reason I'm giving this three stars is because they took away the option to import fonts in the app if there is a way to fix that and allow that then my review will change... otherwise this is the best SMS app I have used in a very long time,3
com.p1.chompsms,Misha Chevalier,"Seems to be working ""as advertised"". NO problems crashing or locking up. Decent enough amount of options to make it useful. It's a good buy!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,SJR,I'm having a issue with someone spamming me using group text messaging. It's still a problem issue because at this time I can't blocklist a group message on Chomp but I'm sure they will figure it out. However I would like to commend Chomp support for their hard work in figuring out my issue.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Half the time the App just stops working and won't send the messages. I'm not confident that it has worked for a while. It used to be good. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Darlene Sepulveda,Great app. you literally can customize everything. only downfall the ads sometimes get in the way of your template button and you cant use it.,4
com.p1.chompsms,MOMMY,I love this app but it doesn't allow audio recordings? Isn't that fairly standard on most messaging apps plus I had a problem with it sending multiple of the same messages to my receivers.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Dartgame 340,Love Chomp. But delete all quit working. Must be fixed cause I just deleted all. Thanks.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I bought pro. New galaxy s10+. App crashes. Server cannot be connected to. Total limp app. If I wanted plain flat white background with no style Ibecause I cant setup anything nor get help because of crashes would stick with what came with the phone. Dont waste the money. Chomp is a chump.,1

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I love Chomp! It is customizable in many ways and you can even schedule messages to send in advance. That is a unique feature. Customer support is great if I have a problem.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Doug Oliver,"Good. Would love to be able to select (and delete/block etc) multiple messages. Also, would be good to have multiple signatures to choose from. But works really well (S10+ Android 11)",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Very customizable user-friendly a bit of a challenge if you're not used to apps in their back ways and roots but you'll find your way nothing I've seen before and certainly not to something I going to get again because this is the one and only off I want Ty for the response!! I've never been responded to. I still adore Stomp! It felt fantastic to rid MYSELF GOOGLE MSG! I'LL try any of your products! ❤️❤️❤️ Stomp!!,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I loved this app...until I realized it couldn't download MMS texts. Searched for a fix online and was encouraged to see the reviewers comment on Chomp's responsiveness...until I realized their feedback dated back to 2014. Will continue to search for a decent texting app.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Steve Mittman,"Nice app but it has 1 serious flaw... You can block individual numbers, but if you receive a group message, you can't block the numbers. I received a spam message sent to hundreds of people, and many of them responded. I was bombarded with text messages with no way to block these numbers.",4
com.p1.chompsms,April Pena,"I have had this app for years & I love it! However, I now have the Samsung S20 Ultra 5G & notifications don't light up my phone now.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Wish add-ons were easier to install. I'd love change my review but the basic app is missing a lot of features such as emojis. There are add-ons for these but once I downloaded those they simply get lost and are impossible to open.,2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Prior, used Verizon's text msg system. Had messages go to wrong person...friend referred me to this because you can set a delay. That way you either send it to intended person, or withdraw it. Easy.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,This app is top notch. I've used off and on for years. I love that I can email myself or someone else for that matter entire conversation thread. Rarely do I ever have any problems with any crashes or malfunction. I do recommend this app.,5

com.p1.chompsms,Roy Lomax,"Simply the best, so many options, theme it to your personal taste. Awesome. 21/05/2022 I'm still using Chomp,I haven't even thought about checking out an alternative. Chomp provides a level of customisability that places it above all others, nothing comes close.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Teenyboy Parker,I switched from Messaging app to Chomp. Chomp better serves my creative desires to improve my message look. Especially like the various background themes to frame my messages. The messages seem to be transmitted faster too.,5

com.p1.chompsms,Poornachandra KS,Nice app and avery good alternative to Google messages. Earlier it was a task to send a contact in messages and Chomp scored here. Lack of Ads is a huge plus for this app. Would wish if it would allow grouping of messages Thanks Chomp group,5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I like the color difference from what my sms usually looks like. The ads at the top are a little annoying but thats one small thing and there not there all the time.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Frank Snyder,I have been receiving SPAM messages for the last few days that I cannot Block or Report as Spam. I'm getting to the point where I feel that the app is starting to compromise the security of my phone. I can't attach a screen shot to show,2

I see no contact information on the app page but was able to find a address to email support about getting a refund and never received a message back. do not waste your time buying this app it will not work and you will not get a reply from these people update. now this devs trying to insult my intelligence. telling me to respond to an email address that I already sent an email to. he's refusing to respond. I'm imploring you people do not purchase this app,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I have used Chomp for many years now and occasionally been tempted away by other promising apps. None have provided all the features that Chomp offers in such an elegant and user friendly way. I would recommend it highly.,5

com.p1.chompsms,Ryan S,If you're going to have a dark theme it needs to be universal. Having an app with a dark theme that suddenly gets brighter than the sun when you go into the settings is obnoxious to say the least.,3

com.p1.chompsms,Xavier Thompson,"Chomp has to be the best SMS app out there. It doesn't have all the extra quirks that bogs most apps down and gives you exactly what you need...

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Has some issues with changing sim. Absurd way of toggling between sims and a huge unnecessary vibration when toggled. This is not calming or relaxing. It's also time consuming.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Dade Halcyon,So far so good. One thing that seems to be missing however is the ability to pick and send animated gifs from the web. I'm used to these features on Telegram.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Christie Owens,"I love chomp! Has been a little spotty lately though. Sometimes I get my texts and sometimes I don't. Also will rate higher if you make to where we have ""read"" receipt. Like to know when people have read my texts.",3

com.p1.chompsms,Louie Ladonga,I like this app. Unlike the last app that i used it took so much resources that made my phone lagged. My only complain about this app is that there is no division per date on the sms conversation. Another complaint: I can download themes but unable to see them in my list so I can apply it.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"advertising shouldnt affect the messaging system as in they shouldnt appear as messages. bottom of screen is ok. Remember, you arent advertising to ten year olds.

UPDATE 2: Always been 5 stars 🥰",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Love it! I had tried a few alternative text options (as my phone is ridiculous and doesn't do group texts) and this one is easiest and smoothest.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Rakesh Kumar,"App is very nicely designed with many features but i miss one thing, it need to have 2 different sim options while sending message like sim1 and sim2 instead of long press to change other sim, it ll help for faster sending of sms from any sim, thanks",3
com.p1.chompsms,Marr Marr,"I really like the app like NEXT SMS.. I wish you could change the color of the notification, I use to have a different color for my contacts so I'll know who text without reading the message first, just get this white generic notification, can this be updated",4

com.p1.chompsms,Raven Rose,I am really happy with this app. I got sick and tired of the messaging app on my phone because most messages or pictures weren't going through and I wasn't receiving them as well. Since I've used Chomp I haven't had any issues.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Keenya H,"Itz okay. I have been using this app for over a decade. The older version that dispayed different colored alert icons as opposed to all white, worked much better. There are also GIF issues.",3

com.p1.chompsms,Jacob Chase,Switched over to Chomp from the default messenger that Galaxy phones have because it was taking ages to send gifs and images. Chomp is way faster and even lets you set a custom compression level which makes it waaaaay faster. Will be using Chomp from here on out!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Rd Nard,"I wish I could give more than 5 🌟. The best sms app ever. Having used it for a month now, can't seem to have any recorded headaches including no ads as of now.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I think this is the best messaging app. Customization i like. But still am I wish to be able. To prevent message delete... Such that before you delete it request for password.  For monitoring texts sent via my phone.,4

Due to the fact you have been using Chomp so long the original email account no longer exists. Blame Google all you want. My phone number has been the same since I started. It would clearly show I am a pro user. None the less the $3.50 didn't break my bank. Just don't ever expect me to pay for anything again. And you best want to make the spam from casinos vanish. Thanx.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Vernisa Donaldson,Pretty good alternative to the stock Samsung messages app. Just confused how it's 2021 and I can't mute a group chat like you can in literally every other messaging app. Bizarre. Otherwise good app though.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Sbc.29,"Didn't receive texts that were sent months before I got them, the only way I got them is when I deleted the app. Not only that, but it screwed my original texting app, this app is the gateway to viruses and getting your phone clapped.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I used this app for 2 days and quickly realized that there's no option to silence certain group texts.

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have been using this app for about a month and have enjoyed it. My only advise to the developer is to not send a text message begging for reviews on Google Play at 11:30pm on a weeknight. Not advisable since people have to work and I would consider this to be outside of the ""ok to text timeframe"".",3
com.p1.chompsms,Kweenie Bee,Great app so far. The messaging app I had kept separating my messages and scrambling them. Chomp works splendidly. I also like all of the customizations. I'm happy I tried it.,5
com.p1.chompsms,C M,"Been using this for years and it's worked fine until the recent update and now its constantly shutting down UPDATE...... I didnt find the Android webview anywhere but Googleprovided an update at 5.30 AM EST and all I did was go to Google Play and update Google Chrome and all of the ""closing aps"" are up and running.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,2 years later and still don't work. No one gets my text or do I get there's. Details says pending like before. New S8 and carrier. Was hoping it would get fixed. Highly dissatisfied.,1

com.p1.chompsms,Jesus Child (Baby),"I have enjoy chomp app for awhile. I like how my texts come up on my screen. Also ,I can put pics with my texts I get and send. I have no problem with the app. If you looking for an app thats do the things you need. Give Chomp app a try.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Clasher Clan,"App works great, better than the default android ""messages"" app. Why do I say hetter? There are many nice additional features in the settings. Why 4 stars and not 5? Currently only sms messages can be scheduled. It would be the best if you could schedule mms messages.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I love this app. I use it as my main text messaging app. I love the ability to personalise background pictures and colours. I recommend it to any serious texters.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Helen Pauline,I wish I could make the font size larger or zoom in. That I could react to text messages sent to me That the app was free (no ad version) That It shows read receipts..not just delivered Otherwise its ok,3
com.p1.chompsms,John Zielke,Crashes occasionally and it need to be uninstalled and reinstalled to work again. But that works every time. It's usually after updates. But it's a good program,4
com.p1.chompsms,A K A,Bought this app some many years ago and still use it only with habit but.... Now it's outdated & troubles with MMS. Androids included txtMSG app far exceeds ChompSMS now with today's new capabilities. Chomp SMS has not changed or improved since i bought it?? what a disappointment seriously.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Janet aka JEMSTAR Dragon,It's supposed to be customizable but I cannot set a theme. It gives me an error message saying to check my SD card. There is nothing wrong with my SD card so it will not let me. Very disappointing.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Geoff Byrne,"So easy to use and very flexible options. Ads are not overly intrusive, some even helpful. Am not surprised that this app is so popular because of multiple features. Well done to developers!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,No mute feature for individual messages. Huge deal breaker. My fantasy football group texts are non stop and I need to mute that conversation without muting my phone or other texts. Going back to Textra.,2

com.p1.chompsms,Emmanuel Justice Okechukwu,"I lovs this App so much but since i install this unique message app whenever i sent a message it takes time to reach its destination. And Moreover when ever i try to download the Chomp themes it dosen't respond at all, i will be glad if this is looked into.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Works better than other text apps but I really dont appreciate the ads and the lack of personalization. Also too many steps to delete should be made much simpler than it is.,1
com.p1.chompsms,david janszen,"Works great. Would have left five stars, but doesn't support RCS. At least not yet. Any plans, Chomp folks?",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jay Van Dalisay,My old default sms messenger in the phone can group text 200 max customers but since its awful system update i looked for an alternative but sadly Chomp wasnt the one i can rely to As a salesman i need an app that can group text many customers and this app cannot do it. It says messge fail. Edit: Super appreciate chomp devs for replying.,5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Better than the default messenger app. You can pin messages and the look and feel isn't much different than the default so it's easy to use right away,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I LikE iT... I installed the many apps for messages but its so good for me but one thing is terrible for me when i send a message to my friend group of 50+ members then after some sending its notify to me about allow to send the message and its so bored for me , please update group Message at least 50 members.

com.p1.chompsms,Kashif Subhan,Its blocks made my messages prevent from recieving to my brothers chomp message app. His messages are not delievered to me. Thats annoying and confusing between the two persons. How pathetic it is after updates. I have been a fan now going to Uninstall it immediately. It was same on my previous LG G5 mobile as well while now again experiencing on Tecno mobiles.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Rodya P,Fast and reliable with minimal unobtrusive ads (you hardly notice them). Went through several msg apps before finding Chomp and can't imagine using anything else 🙂,5
com.p1.chompsms,Phani Chandra VVSS,App is good The best features I like In a messaging app is SMS schedule (Timer message) And Group message As in most of default messaging apps SMS schedule is missing (Truecaller has but can't send more than 20 contacts in group sms) This one has unlimited contacts group texting also SMS timer. Which I love Only thing missing is Number of Contacts we have selected while creating group msg. I need numbers so I make sure <100 contacts I have selected. Hope you fix this bug in next update.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,this app is the best app ever. i was having so much problem sending pictures long tx with messenging. With chomp it does not matter how long or how short it goes tru. as for pictures. love it.,5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I have been using for many years. I absolutely love it. the only thing I wish I could change is the ads at the top. I know of I pay a fee it will be removed. but overall I love how I can put different ringtones for each person,5
com.p1.chompsms,Chris C,While the ads are quite annoying cause sometimes they pop up in a spot when you don't think they're gonna be. It's a very basic but effective text service,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"The ads in this are very intrusive, I'm getting ads that say meet up with girls in (my actual location) even though I didn't give it location permission. I get that they need to make money somehow but this is too much.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have noticed since the update on yesterday that I can no longer see my contact names, I can only see their phone numbers and the screen is black...

com.p1.chompsms,Marjorie Laure,Just what I've been looking for! awesome!..,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I am unable to receive notifications with sound. Only vibration and lightning the screen is observed. I have tried several things but could not resolve the issue,3
com.p1.chompsms,Euan Saunders,It was good but it's missing one feature which is a deal breaker for me. Dual SIM does not support MMS. I've had to go to an alternative that does support it....,3
com.p1.chompsms,Teresa Gibson,Been using the app since Version 1. Love it but have been having trouble when attaching and sending pics. Issue started w/ update back in Jan (Galaxy S9). Hope it's fixed soon! 😊,5
com.p1.chompsms,Hakan,Mute (silence of the notifications) is not working on MIUI and they don't bother to fix it even their another app (textra) is working correctly. I've told this problem via email couple months ago.,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,This app has yet to provide an option to block group messages...especially from unknown/spam numbers who send a group text. I look forward to an update with that feature.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Marc Maxwell,"Does not support v-cards. The developer has gotten many comments from users over the years about this, bit still no v-cards. Other than that, the app works very well.",3

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,It's just okay. There is no way to add someone or delete someone from a group message. The customization in this app is pretty limited as well.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I get so tired of these stupid texting apps that give me the option to put stupid idiotic themes in the background that a 14 year old girl cares about. Why don't you give me the simple option of changing the font size? This app does not allow for that. Uninstalled.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Nida,I've been using Chomp for YEARS. Love it.,5

com.p1.chompsms,Mark S,I have tried them all. The developer truly deserves 5 stars for Chomp. Extremely customizable. Does not miss a thing while not over doing it. The partner app from this developer (Textra) is another great messaging app. I just happened to find Chomp more suited to my style.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Chris Harris,Serves my purpose very well. I like the fact that I can set my own notification sound just for text messages. Recommended.,5

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"The only thing I don't like about this app is that it does not show a link preview of say like a YouTube video that you receive. Let's say you had five YouTube video links in a row, you would be able to tell one from the other in the text app. If it had that, I would give it 5 stars.",4

com.calea.echo,Shaunna 7,"Love this app, it's very easy to use and personalize. My only complaint is since upgrading my phone the personalized notification tones for each user only work if mood is up on my screen at the time the text comes in. Edited 10/25/22-new update totally screwed up the app. If do don't allow the option to monitor phone calls you can't use the texting option. Looking for a new app. üòî",4
com.calea.echo,Tiffany Strodthoff,"March 2020- Loved it for quite a while. In the past 4 months its only gone down hill. Despite updates and attempts to diagnose issues, the help page doesn't exist anymore it still doesn't work as it should. Wanted to try and fix the problems but looks like I'll have to find a new app now Update 7/2021 continues to get worse. Wont send texts, while still receiving them, can't run diagnostic 10/2022 WORSE YET! Can't see anything in chat list. Have to manually look up a contact or read their msg!",1
com.calea.echo,Keith „ÄéTalos„Äè,"This has been my SMS app for years. I bought it and even recommended it to others. Unfortunately, I cannot to that any more. All the recent updates have each reduced the quality of the app further and further. It is sluggish, tries to show ads when it is paid, won't directly send pics from the camera, and now it won't even open. Unacceptable!",1
com.calea.echo,Autumn S,"I have used Mood for years and with several different devices. I've never minded that they had advertising on it, but this most recent update has made the advertisements huge, and it now massively lags and is halfway unusable. I even considered getting lifetime premium thinking that without the ads maybe it would work better. But I literally can't even get through the purchase premium page without it having an error and not being able to buy it. Now I have to find a new text app ):",2
com.calea.echo,Whitney Turpin,I have had mood for a couple of years now. And I had the premium service. Until you updated your app in 3/22.  And it kicked me off from the premium service.  And now I cannot get back on.  It says that there is a problem on your end every time I try. And NOW... you're update today has ads all over the pages.  Which I absolutely hate.  Which is why I paid for the premium service to begin with.  If the problem is on YOUR end you need to remove the ads until you FIX THINGS!!!,1
com.calea.echo,Wesley Cook (Caerdivon),"Every update there's something different for me to complain about. Previous update was issues with double notifications with the forced overlay (which was able to be fixed with an obscure setting). Now, with the most recent update the app lags *HARD* if its open for more than a few minutes, requiring me to restart the app after each text message to be able to comfortably send it without the application lagging behind my button presses by 1-2 seconds. This used to be a great app, what happened?",1
com.calea.echo,Jessica Gillette,"Had used this app for years until a couple of months ago when it became so glitchy and slow I was forced to get a new messaging app. You guys had something great and then ruined it with a bunch of massive ads that slowed the app down and glitch out. Too bad you won't learn from your mistakes (and no, I won't buy anything from you because it still won't work).",1
com.calea.echo,Annette Groseclose,"I loved using this app for years. However with the most recent update it's become a terrible nuance. It will not allow you to turn the bubble popup feature off, it freezes and locks up constantly and is super slow. I finally got rid of it. Wish they would have left it alone the new updates ruined the app.",1
com.calea.echo,Aaron White (Aaron),"I like the customizability but I am unable to upgrade to premium. I need the premium version for use with my Huawei GT2 Pro watch. Ergo, it's of no use to me. Because it's the only messaging app that works with the watch, the watch is less useful because of the app. Extremely frustrated. I spent 45 min trying to figure out how to give this company my $14.99. It could be an issue with my very normal Android phone but I highly doubt it. Now I need to send the watch back. So thanks a lot!!",2
com.calea.echo,Eric Mcdow,"I have been using more for a long time and have referred many of my associates. This last update is absolutely horrible! Sluggish, freezing, or just completely not responsive! In addition I paid for premium service that was taken away with this last update. I used to love mood. But at this point very disappointed. I hated the last update with all the overlays after calls and text!... just go back to the Original mood I was using 5 years ago and leave well enough alone please!",2
com.calea.echo,Lavelle Hall,1. After the most recent update text are taking way to long to go through and some are not sending at all. This is non-negotiable. 2. There are still a lot of blocked out emojis. 3.Now the app's notification isn't showing up on my watch when new text come in. This feature is the most essential part of having a smart watch. Not being able to receive notifications on my watch makes this app's rating a negative 1.,1
com.calea.echo,Serg Eguiarte,Update: Mood Customer service was fantastic in responding and found the issue was with my settings and not the app. Thank you! The app doesn't notify me of incoming messages. The sound alert is gone. What can I do to fix it? I've tried everything and I have the paid version.,5
com.calea.echo,Christina Goodnight,"I have been using this app a long time and am a premium user. I can't use this app anymore. It's excruciating slow and laggy, when I pull down on messages it slides over to contacts. I can't even type a message without it being so behind it's so slow. It freezes up. I won't be using this app until they fix it back to how it used to work.",1
com.calea.echo,Hillary Brown,"Used to be the best messaging app ever. Hands down. I even bought the premium. I still think this could be the best but I keep running into problems like two separate pop up notifications with no way to pick one or the other. This could probably be resolved easily enough, except that notifying support through the app fails to go through. Every. Time.",1
com.calea.echo,Dean C,Loved this product for years. Actually a paid user. The interface and private box were very good. But through each of the last two phones I have transferred this app to it has been excruciating to send or receive mms photos and messages. I've tried multiple texting apps with no issue on this subject. No one at Mood seems to be able to correct this and for the first time in over 10 years I'm changing apps.,2
com.calea.echo,Kayla,This last mood update has been terrible. My messages are slow to respond to and slow in receiving.. I have to close the app constantly in order to send messages. Please provide a fix for this. It's getting annoying and frustrating. It takes me about a minute to text a message and another to send. I sometimes also have to open the app to receive messages.,1
com.calea.echo,Ken B,"Just as everyone else has said, Mood was excellent over the years until the three most recent updates over June-August 2022. Now you can't remove the bubble, you will get multiple notifications for a single text, it stalls, and the notification that normally appears on the app itself alerting you of a new message and the message count, has disappeared. Definitely time to find another app if they can't get this fixed!!!!",1
com.calea.echo,Blondie33 Delong,"Since the recent update your app is super laggy & unstable!!! I can't even write a text most times, without having to completely close the app & restart it. Or the message gets deleted before I can send it. I have used Mood for many years & have absolutely loved it & never had any issues with it. Now I am going to switch to a different messaging app. Please listen to all your costumers reviews & fix these problems!!!",1
com.calea.echo,Mike Savenelli,"Had to remove due to a recent update. A new call monitoring feature called After Call takes over the phone app, adding nothing useful, and you cannot fully disable it. It also adds more ads during and after phone calls. You cannot use the SMS app without this feature, nor if you deny the app access to phone calls. I'm disappointed since this has always been an excellent sms app, and these new features are both unnecessary and unwanted.",1
com.calea.echo,KS W,"I did use Mood for years. Quirks, let it go. Downloaded it today. Unfortunately none of my sent typed texts appeared, only the response texts. I tried Mood settings, my own phone settings, no change. I uninstalled, reinstalled, no change. It's still my all time favorite, except it's non functional. If the bugs are fixed, I will definitely reinstall again.",1
com.calea.echo,Kelsey Isenberg,I have had this app for years never had a problem until now. It has become very very slow. I cannot even text anyone without waiting for mood to catch up or going back several time to correct what was actually picked up out of my text. It misses every other word of so. Getting frustrated and may have to find another option,3
com.calea.echo,ShayComposed ‚ÄúShay‚Äù,"Love it!!! I was skeptical on download at first, but going through all the options and customizations I've found it to be way better than the default apps that come with any phone, no matter what phone. [[ July 7, 2022 update ]] The only issue I've found recently is the App glitched (after immediately updating the App as per usual) all my texts got wiped. It was a great thing I synced and did the ""Backup/Restore"" features' process. That was there only thing I experienced kind of querky. üíØüîí",5
com.calea.echo,Donna Fick,A few years in and it has become annoying and increasingly difficult to use. I truly don't need my phone (used as a phone) linked to everything in the universe. I don't want to give more permissions. I don't want an app to tell me it needs to be more intrusive so it can serve me better-every time I make or receive a call. I don't understand why it tells me 'call started' even after a received call. I'm tired of having to swipe in multiple places to get rid of all the notifications received.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I rarely send a review on anything but I had to say something about this. I've had the app for a little over a year. I liked that you could customize it, it was fun. BUT NOW, there's ADS! Nobody wants to see ads in their texting app, something you deal with having ads; internet (fine), games (fine) not in a texting app. It really doesn't help that's its placed at the top. Very disappointed. Currently looking for A different app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"üò° This app used to be fantastic and had a lot of great features for the user to enjoy, especially the themes! However, that is all in the past now, as this app sucks more with every update that's made. üòî Every time I send a text, I get an error saying, ""failed to send"", even if it actually did send. So, there's no way of knowing if it's actually sending or not, unless you call the person you attempted to text to see if they received it. It also takes forever to download photos; like hours. üëé",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've been using Mood and enjoying its features for some time, but after the recent update, I've switched to a different SMS app. Like others, I'm not okay with the new ad placed at the top of my message list. I expect ads since I don't have premium, but the ad is badly placed and loads after a delay, which often results in a tap on the ad instead of my top conversation. On top of that, my messages don't seem to send reliably with this update - the wait cursor just spins for minutes at a time.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Publishers help! I LOVE this app and have replaced my phone's original SMS with this! HOWEVER, I can unfortunately only give it three stars because not all the time, but too often, my text messages don't come through until I've clicked on & opened the app. No I don't have the app hibernating, it is very much on in the background. Sometimes it alerts me without having to open the app, sometimes it doesn't. And frankly, that can be quite an inconvenience when people are trying to get ahold of me!",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I've tried about every messaging app out there and wasn't satisfied. For one reason another they always had some feature missing. this app is so comprehensive and has every feature I want. Even some that I didn't know existed. The settings are laid out so that if you aren't tech savvy you can still figure out what you want and if you are tech savvy It offers an advanced setting menu. LOVE the group text versatility.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I have just noticed an issue with this otherwise great app.  Whenever I go to send a multimedia message, typically a photo, the app disconnects from WiFi......even my home network......and then sends it over cellular data instead.  I didn't select this and I can't figure out how to de-select it.  If I can't get this fixed, I'll be discontinuing use of this app because I don't have unlimited data on my current plan and don't plan on getting it.  I would have rated it 5 starts if not for the aforementioned issue.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"perhaps this App doesn't work well with the Galaxy. The app froze constantly and caused my phone to lock up at least once a day. I like the graphics and the features. However, sending group messages is a hassle. The app would freeze and no new messages would come in until I either shut down the phone or deleted the group chat. I contacted the company twice and explained the issues, seeking a solution. They did not respond to my messages. I uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Overall, I like the app. Occasionally, I receive messages days after they were originally sent! That's beyond annoying and problematic. Update** It's a few months later and I'm STILL having the same problem!! When I go into assistance, it doesn't showing a ""warning"" button. So as far as I know, there isn't an infering app. I'd update to premium if I thought that would solve the problem! Love this app. Truly don't want to change to something different. Any help would be appreciated!!!",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Works great - sometimes. No ads which is great. A lot of customization, also great. I like the design and layout. However there is sometimes a long delay in sending messages. And I'm often not receiving any messages unless I actually have the app open. And yes, I have checked the settings. It's the app thats glitchy. When it works it's great, but it lags too often and I had to move on to a different app.",3
com.calea.echo,Nick Pizarro,"I have been using Mood for years now, so I eventually bought the full version. However, Mood seems worst now that I bought it. If I reply to a group message, my response is sent out as an individual text to all of the recipients in that group; my settings are not set to do that. Additionally, the app seems considerably slower. Attaching photos from gallery to a text doesn't work; it only shows a gray box in the photo preview. The app is updated, but if these things aren't fixed, I'll be leaving.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"My new phone wouldn't do group messaging w/o sending individual text to each person in the group. Which I don't want. Neither the phone carrier or the phone co. could figure it out. So I downloaded this app. it works great! I would give 5 stars but it doesn't seem to send my pdf attachments. When I asked for help for this and another issue from the ""support"" I got no response. But for texting, group texting, and sending pictures it does a great job!",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like many of the features, but I'm having a problem. I've sent several messages to ""support"" and haven't even gotten a response, just an acknowlegement that I sent it. When I use my voice to text feature, which I prefer to use most of the time, after I stop talking my message is duplicated at least once. As a result, I have to go back through and edit my message before sending it, or look like an idiot for sending the same verbiage repeated several times in the same message! Time to replace it",1
com.calea.echo,Brad Sharp,"By far the best features of any SMS app available. However, I'm having horrible problems with receiving messages on Android 10 and 11 (LG and Google phones). Delivery is often delayed until I unlock the phone. Which defeats the purpose of instant messaging. Also, the chat heads feature only works about 10% of the time. I've been working on solving the problems for over 6 months and multiple devices. All settings that could affect delivery have been addressed. Mood doesn't appear to have much in the way of help. 5 stars if these critical issues were addressed. Until then only 2.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I used to love this app. It was by far the best the SMS app out there. But some recent updates have caused the app to go to üí©. The ads were a negative because they said it would always be free but I could live with them since the rest of the app performed well. But now it is slower. Freezing up. Not sending notifications when SMSes received. Sometimes I can't click into a contact to read the message. I gotta crash the app and let it restart for things to function again. Fix it! üòïüò°,2
com.calea.echo,"Dr. Karen Clark Scott, PT","I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've used this app for years. I love the customization options and ease of use. But support is lacking. I've probably sent 10 support messages over the years and may have heard back once. In the past month, floating notifications stopped working. Messages often fail or take 5 minutes to send. I hate to leave but I need something more reliable.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,some interesting features but after paying for the full version and using it for a couple weeks. it is too automated and has some limitations. for example pictures have to be sent as links if too big. also too many features that aren't relevant to professional users. noisy and cluttered UI. wish i could get my money back. my mother had the same feedback. also no web or browser based texting. i was hopeful but that hope is gone.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It pains me to leave this review. I have been a long time user, but recently the app has become unusable. I could handle the introduction of ads, but soon after my multimedia texts would not send, and I wasn't receiving texts until I would open the app. Then in an update, mood would sneakily send a link for recipients to download the app anytime I sent a text. I couldn't even see it on my end. This has since been fixed, but the other issues persist. I wanted so badly for this app to work again.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Better Before. I've had this app for a couple of years and loved it for texting. Then they updated and made the phone call so weird. After a call, you get this weird screen. Then I just updated again and now I have an ad at the top of my messages screen. It is started to get annoying to constantly see ads on your screen. Or have to see anad every time someone calls.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,The app updated this morning and I haven't been able to send text message since. It looks like it sent but nobody is receiving them. I still receive messages but I can't send them. I even tried rebooting the phone. PLEASE FIX SOON. UPDATE: Thanks for fixing this app. This is my favorite app for group texting. You can change from mms to sms easily. You can also add or delete people from a conversation without having to create a new message thread.,5
com.calea.echo,Justin Luttrell,"It used to be really good, but lately I've noticed the incoming messages get delayed. I'll open the app and see like 3 different messages from different people pop up in less than 10 seconds, as if they'd been stuck. Also, as of whatever update prior to June 23, 2021, now every time I get an incoming message, I've noticed my phone WiFi will disconnect a few seconds before I see the message. EVERY. TIME. It's really annoying and I've emailed the support team, we'll see if they actually respond.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love this SMS application. it has a ton of features and customizations too. it also doesn't seem to take a lot of ram so your battery should be fine. I have a huawei mate 10 pro. it has a big battery anyway. I am experiencing a problem. when opening a message, the application at times closes. once opened, it doesn't do it for awhile. still this is annoying because your whole message isn't saved. please fix this. I'm on 8.0",4
com.calea.echo,Carrie R,"I am beyond frustrated with this app. I've used it for years, with the occasional glitch, but it's been pretty reliable. Lately I get no led notifications. My phone stays on mute, so that's the only way I know if I have a text. It seems there are general notification issues from other reviews, which is a huge issue! Please fix this, we need to know that we have messages!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Horrid since update. Yesterday I got a pop up telling me I needed to update the app so I did. I've been using it for years with no issues. Since the update, no message I send gets delivered to the recipient. It shows on my end as sent, but they never get it. Then suddenly the message is just gone as if I never typed it. Unfortunately I have to uninstall and go back to stock messaging since that one isn't having issues.",1
com.calea.echo,Angelica Nagy,"I have used mood for years and have never had a problem, until recently. It's easy to use and the media options are great. Except I can't seem to send pictures through the app any more. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Reset my phone. Gone through my system settings, everything I can think of to do, and still can't send pictures. And since that is something I tend do a lot, It's very frustrating and I'm seriously considering using another app.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"So many customization options, even in the free app, it's crazy fun! The chat options and all the help this app gives you on making sure you have your SMS & MMS settings correct, and help if they aren't working. And all this in the free version. When there are ads, which seems infrequent, they cover about half the screen usually you can just hit the back button & they go away. The only suggestion would be somewhere to get little tidbits of information about what certain symbols and such mean.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"*UPDATE* I still like this app. It is one of the best apps... However, there are still some blinding flaws. If you receive multiple pictures at once they come in blurry not like if you just received one. Also, contacts that are in the private box do not remain hidden when texting. Their notifications pop up like anyone else even when the private settings are in place. Now after the update almost every message is getting flagged as a failed message to send. Things aren't getting better.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This app was phenomenal. The customization is great and you can edit almost anything you want in terms of speech bubbles, background, themes, etc. The recent problem it's having is my text messages are coming in hours after they were sent to me, and some of them are time sensitive due to my job. For now I've had to switch back to my regular keyboard because i absolutely can not have that happening. I see others have the same problem so i am hoping it is fixed soon.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This is the perfect app. However, the update they just pushed today adds a gaudy, in-your-face lime green banner up top for advertising purposes (that when you tap, restarts the entire app). There isn't any way to turn it off, and the text on the banner says it is specifically there for new features specific to this app, so it's just sitting there as a frustrating placeholder for no reason. This ain't it, chief. I guess it's back to Textra for me then.",2
com.calea.echo,Sonfa Lovings,"I use to love this app, but after the recent update, I've had nothing but problems with this app. I no longer have sound with my SMS notifications. Went through all the settings to ensure they were set correctly and still can't receive sound notifications. It's a real pain to have to constantly look at my phone to see if I have text messages. Will have to revert back to the original messaging app. This one has becoming useless.",1
com.calea.echo,Danaii Davin,"I've stuck with this messaging app for over 2 years, before finally uninstalling it a few days ago. It has increasingly gone from slightly glitchy, to all out technical instability in that time. The biggest pro with this app is it's clever aesthetic design. When looking for a replacement for this underwhelming platform, I was hard-pressed to find anything that equaled up to it's customization/options. But that pro can only last so long when you're missing a good chunk of your personal messages.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Notification Sound Gone I used to love this app due to the fact that the black theme is easy on my eyes. It's flawless when it comes to searching through messages, themes, and how everything is displayed. BUT, suddenly I can't get a sound when I receive a message. It's infuriating. I'm not the only one, I have read a few with the same problem during this same period. If it's not fixed soon, I'll get another apo.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've always been relatively happy with this app, having used it for a couple years now, but as of late not so much. Pictures I send, only show as the last one sent, even when clicked upon. And I no longer get the pop-up or heads up notifications despite having them enabled. I'm not a fan of the random color change of my contact bubbles either.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like this app, except almost every day the app will freeze up on me. I won't be able to open a message and/or send any messages. I ended up walking away from my phone for a bit and when I finally come back up it, it'll be working. It seems like if you're trying to do more then one thing, this causes an issue with the app. EDIT: Uninstalling this app. I keep having to restart my phone due to this app being overwhelmed. I can't send a text and receive one at the same time.",1
com.calea.echo,Samuel Barr,"I've been using this app for years. This past year, I saw ads in my inbox. No problem, I was happy to purchase the premium version to remove the ads and support the devs. Today, however, I started getting ads as push notifications from mood out of no where. I paid to get rid of those, but apparently it doesn't matter. There are plenty of other free (and ad-free) messaging apps out there.",2
com.calea.echo,CJ Kadar,After I got a new phone I started finding issues with mood. It's only gotten worse with updates. There is NO customer support. The buttons are just for show. I haven't been able to receive any images sent to me and mood claims it's because of my phone's battery optimization (which doesn't even have an option to optimize mood or not because it's grayed out). I just tried to switch between messagers and now I can't even open text chats in the app and can't figure out why.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I have been using this app for over a year now and within the the past 2 months I've had issues with an app update. Now I get the ads banner on top of my list of messages which is distracting and now all of a sudden, I can't send messages!!!! I've deleted and reinstalled this app twice and it keeps doing the same thing......NOT SENDING MESSAGES!!!!! So to hell with this app!",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've been using this app for several years and generally been pretty happy with it until recently; other reviewers cover most of the other recent issues. The most recent update reset my custom notifications, and crashes the sound picker every time it tries to open it (i tested the picker with other apps and it's only this one it crashes with). Between this and all the other recent issues, plus the ads, this is kind of the final straw. I think I'll be looking for a new sms app.",1
com.calea.echo,Sara Barrett,"I have used this app for a couple of years so when the ads started I didn't hesitate to upgrade to the premium version. Unfortunately, for several months now MMS messages consistently fail... Both sending and receiving. I've sent emails and haven't had a response. In reading the reviews I see this is an issue for several others as well but I have no idea if it's being worked on based on the replies. I'm disappointed because I paid and am now forced to find another app due to the MMS issue. :(",2
com.calea.echo,morgan moore,"I love this app, but since the last update I have not been able to send or recieve pictures messages. I've check all the settings and email for help. No response. If I'm not able to fix this I will unfortunately have to change apps. Which I don't want to do since this app fits all my customization needs and keeps it all organized. Outside of the MMS issue this app works perfect.",4
com.calea.echo,Cazador64,"After months and months of the app only vibrating when I received messages, or in most cases, not even getting a message until I opened the app itself, one of the updates finally fixed it. But now, again, less than a couple weeks later, it's back to the same issue of only vibrating instead of ringing, and not receiving messages unless I open the app. And no, it has nothing to do with the Do Not Disturb slider. I will be moving on until it gets fixed.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to love this app - but have been experiencing more and more problems. I really loved how customizable everything is, but have been getting three notifications per text (two from my phone and one from mood, with quick replies that I have turned off!) I miss this app but I hate getting three simultaneous notifications. Reached out to support 20 days ago and haven't heard anything back. Would love to go back to mood once these issues are solved.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Was working great. i even purchased the app. Recently I tried to change some of the settings and every time I did, it would get a blue tint on the list of messages. Only way to get rid of it was to reset to defaults. I did that and now I can't find where the setting is the have check mark when someone reads the text. That feature is extremely handy.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Unfortunately, I had to change my rating from 5 stars down to 1. The fonts are no longer working... I get a download error for some reason. Also no new themes have been added in over a year when I was told there would be new ones coming soon within the next few months. Also (again)! Whenever I try reaching out to the support team, absolutely *no one* responds back anymore. It's a dead shame because I really loved this SMS app. I'll just uninstall it and move on to chomp or GO SMS Pro now.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Worked well in the beginning.  My only complaint was that the sound notification within chat was a short bleep.  Customization of sound when the app is closed no longer works, just another short beep as well.  Very easy to miss messages.  I've set it up to hear the sound notification through headsets as well, but it never came through either.  Pretty unusable now.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be a great app, had it for years. All of a sudden it's been useless. I turned the caller id feature off because it's a nuisance & it still comes through. In order to see the separate chat list messages I have to close the app completely & go back in because there's no way to get to the other lists once you've already chosen one. & now I get absolutely no text notifications. I won't know if I have a text until I open the app & new texts have been sitting there for hours. Uninstalling.",2
com.calea.echo,Annie Singer,"I've been using this app for years, and at some point they added a sneaky new call feature. It claims to add caller ID, but all it does is track calls and mine data. I did not agree to this. I keep turning it off (which is hard to do, and set up with so many skeezy dialogue boxes) but it turns itself back on every time. It has an option to ""delete your data and content,"" but this link is broken and always says it failed to delete. This is not what I want from a texting app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used this app for a while and it was pretty good. However since the last update group texts are no longer working. The app just keeps crashing over and over again if you try to open or write a group text. I submitted a ticket via their ""Assistance"" function in the app, but no response was provided after several days of waiting. Had to de-install and look for a different messaging app. Sad that they can't get that fixed and that the support is so poor.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Love this app but there's no simple way to view a contact, as a result there's no way to set a contact as a favorite unless you edit the contact and hit save because apparently the star doesn't show up during contact edit. That's just weird to me. No option to mark messages as unread. When searching for message context it'll find and highlight it but it doesn't include the remaining text messages so essentially you don't know where in the conversation what you're looking for exists. So stupid.",4

It was quick, I could group text, send pictures and videos. Recently I have not been happy with the app. I cannot get messages unless my phone is unlocked, which is not ideal, and as such I do not get notifications to my watch in a timely manner and I cannot open pictures from anyone else. Really disappointing.I hate the ad placing. Forcing us into premium?",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I haven't gotten calls yet, so I can't say anything about the caller ID. The customization is great, and party mode is a cool idea I haven't seen anywhere else. The only thing that bugs me so far (and it bugs me a lot) is the app icon itself. It always looks like there's a notification. Why do so many SMS apps do that? With all the customization options, I'm surprised you cannot change the app icon like you can in Textra.",4
com.calea.echo,Kate Patton,"Originally, it did everything I wanted. Now, it still does most of what I want but with the last update it now has extremely intrusive push advertisements. Not only intrusive but also disruptive. This needs to be taken care of.

Update: Thank you for your response, that fixed the issue.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,freezes like water in Antarctica. Was good for a while. Really enjoyed it. But now it doesn't seem to work well at all. Could be the last phone update or the app. Not sure if the app is compatible with the update. What I do know is that it freezes a lot and I don't get my txt unless I open the app. No notifications on phone or watch anymore. Fix bugs or see customers go elsewhere.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used this app when I had my moto z2 play, as the default messaging app was absolutely unbearable to use. and let me just say: I LOVE mood. the customization features are incredible, along with the built in animated emoji and gif support (which I have never found in any other downloadable MMS app). the only thing that ever bothered me was how huge the notifications are in landscape mode. I play a lot of high-speed reflex games, and often times the notifications would block up half of my screen.",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"this app is great!! it perfectly gives me the look and feel of an iPhone without really having one. my only complaints are that you should be able to name groupchats, have the contact picture show up next to the name right above the chat, and most IMPORTANTLY be able to adjust the space between text bubbles in the chat. the bubbles between the sender and the recipient are too close together. please fix, otherwise great app !!",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've been using this app for several years and it was working JUST FINE until you did whatever you did in the last few updates. Now all of a sudden I get 2 notifications, one from my systems and (thankfully) the floating notifications. 5/31: I give you credit for fixing the double notification & the tone issue. But you still didn't fixbthe chathead issue. which was easily the best feature. Very Disappointed.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"the app was good until they installed caller ID. I can't turn it off, I've missed several calls because now my phone doesn't ring when someone calls me. I went into the app to turn off all caller ID settings & they keep coming back on after I've swiped to turn them off. I'm very upset about this so I'm going to have to get rid of it. there's no privacy with the caller ID either. a picture of the person calling pops on your screen then when you hang up the last text between you shows. not good!",1

Each new update breaks more and more features (emojis, notifications, etc). Strike two. Now I'm getting ads in my notifications via this app?? Unbelievable! Banner ads within the app are one thing, but popping up outside that is an absolute no-go! Uninstalling this garbage.",1
com.calea.echo,Lori Warden,Loved this app for years. I love all the customizations. But the last update in the update today have caused a lot of issues. Lately I never get my texts on time. I may not get a notification for 30 to 45 minutes after a text is actually sent to me. Unless I have the app open and I'm actively using it. The most recent update has caused my group chats not to function. Once I select all my contacts to send the text to the contact selection window just stays open. I can't actually send the text,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Ever since the update my messages will sometimes not come through until I open the app and they'll all come streaming in at once and out of order. I have not changed any of my notification settings or power settings and it looks like I'm not the only one with this issue. When it worked it was great. It's practically useless right now though. I'm uninstalling in the meantime.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Loved it initially on my new Galaxy S9 but I can't get the different notification sounds to stay. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. I think the tones are different when you're looking at a text than when your looking at the list of contacts you've been texting. I want the sound for that contact to stay the same no matter where I am on the phone.,3

I bought a new phone, thought that would fix the issue and paid for a lifetime subscription, now it's freezing up again and not sending texts for hours or until I open the account. I've tried troubleshooting. Don't waste your money on this app until they get it together.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I've been using this app for years without any issue. All of a sudden about a week ago the sound on notifications stopped working. I've tried adjusting all the settings and app permissions and nothing helps. The only way I can get a notification is by using the vibrate option. This isn't helpful unless I'm very close to the phone. I love this app but unless I can fix this problem I'll have to switch to something else. I'll change my rating back to 5 stars once this issue is resolved. UPDATE: Still having problems with sound notifications AND now my text aren't coming through for hours. No texts and then I'll open the app and they all start pouring in at the same time but they're from hours ago. According to the reviews I'm not the only one having this issue.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I normally love this app. lots of customizations. however, lately it had been having issues. Like ""telling""me I have a new message, and I don't. It's an old message that says you have hit download button to view it. It's always one that I previously saw already. If you can fix this, I'll give 5 stars, If not, I'm cancelling my premium subscription and find another app because it's very annoying.",4
com.calea.echo,Hanna Castle,"*Edit* Did not change any settings, notifications are set to default. I used to be able to even set to have custom tones to different people, that haven't been working for the past 5-6 updates, but now I don't have any sound what so ever! From the look of the reviews, it seems I'm not the only one! Again after the update, the notification sounds stopped working! I love this app but not being able to set the notification sounds to my liking is a big negative for me!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I loved this app. But after androids latest update the chat bubble has started to act up. Before when someone texted you, you could click the bubble and text through that if you didn't want to open the whole app. But now when I do that after I send the message it closes the bubble right away. It's annoying since that was the most convenient function of the app. Even if you change the setting to keep the bubble active, every time you send a message it will instantly close unless using the full app.",3

Im missing message notifications and dealing with crashing. I love the features of this messenger and hate not using it. Other than the bugs for my Galaxy 8+, this is a really awesome app. Took away a star",4

Showing notifications when they are none, not showing notifications when there are new ones, resurrecting old notifications that had already been cleared, displaying texts out of order, etc. I don't know what happened but I absolutely do not recommend this app in its current state. I'm currently searching for a replacement.",1

Now on regular texting, it constantly says it is still sending or that it has failed even though the recipient has already responded. I can't ever tell when a message has actually sent. Customer support has been useless. Hate to have to switch, but looks like I do.",1

Updating review: I don't know what the developer has done, but now every time I finish a phone call (never use Mood app for calls), the screen goes to Mood with an ad. I use my phone for Waze a LOT bc I travel for work. Every time I finish a call I have to exit Mood to get back to my navigation. This is frustrating and annoying and potentially dangerous.

Instead, it just tells you that it's too large. Yet I don't run into this problem with other messaging apps.",2

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This is my favorite app. It has so many settings that are both stylish and extremely useful. It has no ads, ever, and it's premium is so cheap for the yearly plan ($5) that it's a treat to have. Not only that but it responds and looks a lot better than my default messaging app, so overall I hope whoever made this app never gives it up or turns it into a cash grab. It's honestly perfect where it is in my eyes.",5
com.calea.echo,Yolanda Stratton,"I use to really like this app, but every since the update I am unable to attach pictures through the app. And I'm unable to download message tones. I use to be able to download ringtones and message tones, but not anymore. Especially for my private messages. In the contacts, it doesn't allow you to set a message tone. Im very disappointed with the app now",3
com.calea.echo,Dakota Hobday,"It's okay, gone downhill. I used this app for years but recently, the loss of stickers and most emojis has really sucked. Some basic emojis don't even show up anymore, only as 3 dots. Starting to get ads but not as many as others. Images sent to me crash sometimes. The customization is amazing and I love it, although I'm sad to have lost the option to have extra fonts as it crashes my phone otherwise. I'll be forced to leave, I think :/",3

Custom text tones do not work and if I try to change a text tone (currently only Pixel text tones are working) the app crashes. I used to love this app. I even purchased the premium. Very unhappy. I have been hoping for an update to fix this but nothing. I've have play thru headset off and turned off safe mode. Nothing...",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I liked this app enough to buy a lifetime subscription, despite that filling in contacts for a group text was clumsy. But now it's constantly bugging me to turn off WiFi! Why??? I don't have unlimited data, so turning off WiFi and forgetting to turn it back on can be a big problem. I went back to Google Messages, which doesn't seem to mind WiFi being on.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It's great. Allows custom tones and text bubbles. Doesn't do regular ringtones but it's just for texting. Contact colors are customizable. The only drawback is that if you are writing a message to someone and someone else texts you, the message gets sent to that person instead of who you were texting.",5
com.calea.echo,Kilika765,"Okay I'm done with this app. Ever since they started incorporating the ads the app just doesn't work properly anymore. Text messages don't always send, missing texts, always glitchy where I have to constantly keep closing and opening the app, etc. This app used to work FLAWLESSLY, then once they start making money off the ads the app goes to hell. Makes no sense to me. There's way too many issues that have been goong on for months now that it's obviously not going to be fixed. BYE!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be great, but after the update a few weeks ago, it's been inconsistent. Exhibit A, I sent a text 10 minutes ago and it's still loading to be sent.

I love this app and want to keep it, but will uninstall if this continues.",1

I hate to complain over one detail when everything else is great (and I do mean great) but the DoNotDisturb notification only has one option and no way of allowing individual notification sounds.

Plus, if you disable drawing over other apps you are locked out from even using it at all. Only options are to change settings or quit. Yeah, real flexible, huh Word of advice: forcing stupid half-baked and unasked for ""features"" on your users will drive people away from your app. Idiots.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like the app, it gives me a variety of customization options. Which is exactly what I love in an SMS text. But one thing I love more is smooth and cohesive functionality. Whenever I get a popup message from the app in my notifications that one of my friends texted. I usually like to send a reply to them while not actually being in the app. Sadly, whenever I write a text outside of the app, it never sends, then fails to send. I also have to wait for the text to fully send before closing the app",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Wow. surprisingly great texting application. I really liked the features and flexibility with this app. However, I wish that the name and icon would change and appear a bit more professional.

com.calea.echo,Stephanie Smith,I have enjoyed this app for years until recently. I am no longer able to reliably send pictures and I am one to send a lot of pictures. The MOST annoying part is that sometimes the app will indicate that the pic failed to send when it really did. I have no way to know either way so ultimately I end up bombarding someone with the same pic OR they never get it at all.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love the feature where you can hide the private messages, but the app gets hung up to much. It freezes a lot and I have to go in and force stop it to get the message to go through. Lately when I send pictures they just get hung on my end, but appears they are seen on the other end. The person will comment on a picture even though on my end, I still have moving dots. Update 1-23-20- Fix the hangups..I have to force stop a lot with this app.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used to love this app. So cute with the custom themes, love the ability to set custom colors and alerts for different people. But this latest update has me wanting to uninstall it. Big ad banner at the top of the screen, very intrusive. A bug where it looks like your texts are still pending but they have been received (because you get a response). Three texts deep, still showing as pending. Turned off Head Notifications months ago & they are still on. Never replied to my bug report :(",3
com.calea.echo,Courtney Hipp,"I've had a lot of ups and downs with this app (""breaking"" when updated), but when everything is working correctly (as it apparently is now), this is my review: Fun and easy to use, lots of options in the free version, little to no ad intrusion.

com.calea.echo,Bill Johnson,"This app used to be the best for instant messages, but it has deteriorated. I have tried to send support requests from the app and it fails with an ""unspecified error"". I have tried to contact them by Facebook messenger, and they don't reply. I have noticed in the Facebook comments that many people, including premium members are unable to get replies to their support issues. The app used to have a setting that allowed a chime to be rung on the hour. However, that setting seems to have disappeared. I had turned this on a while ago but now want to turn it off, but can't yet it continues to chime. Sometimes it chimes on the hour, but sometimes it chimes randomly so it is no longer working properly. This is one example of how things have deteriorated. I used to rate this app 5 stars, but no more. Too many problems and no one replies to support requests. I will delete it soon and use something else.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Was great while it lasted. In the past few months I started having trouble getting message notifications while my phone was locked. They would all come rolling in when I unlocked my phone. And then when I started getting some random caller ID/unknown caller messages after a phone call I got very confused because this is supposed to be a text messaging app. It just got to be too much trouble so I had to uninstall it and now everything is working how it should be with my notifications and calls.,2
com.calea.echo,Travis Royer,"Been using this app happily for years. Now as of about 5 days ago, many of the emojis are not working and just display three dots in a circle (wether I'm sending or receiving). I've tried everything up to and including deleting everything and reinstalling, and problem persists. Contacted cucumber support, but no response as of yet. App updated about 10 days ago, and I suspect that is when the problem started. Hope something is done soon to fix the issue, or I'll have to find another app.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Best I've Used. My only peeve is if you have to open the app instead of using its popup window it takes a little while longer that way. Love the features and customization and I really like that you can enable the popup and reply from there or choose from a list of customizable quick replies. I've gotten so much use out of that feature.,4
com.calea.echo,E Mazing,"I had this app for years and loved it. After an update in late 2021, text messages started showing up hours after they'd been sent. The most recent update only made it worse. More times than not, I don't even get text messages. Group messages are the worst. If I even receive tgem, they come in as an individual text then populate in the original group message. So I get double the notifications and nothing shows up in the order they were sent. As of today, I'm deleting this app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"TL;DR: great unless you use a smart watch. I love the customization options of the app. It works great on the phone. But when there are multiple messages, the notification changes from the message content to ""2 new messages"" until you drag the notification. The problem is that it does the same thing on Wear OS which completely defeats the purpose of having a smart watch if I can't read the message. Incoming texts also don't vibrate the watch when every other sms app seems to just fine.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Super personable and versatile! Edit. Deleting 2 stars from initial 5 star review due to 2 separate occasions when messages just stop arriving through Mood. I send a message, which doesn't even confirm as sent, and replies just don't happen . Fortunately, messages weirdly arrive via my phone's standard messaging app, which isn't set as my default, so it won't let me reply unless I switch it back from mood. So twice now I've had to reinstall the app to get it working again. Hassle.",3
com.calea.echo,Shannon Baz-Casper,"I love this app - the customization options are great! Unfortunately, the app underwent a recent update that makes it buggy and it no longer shows me when I have new messages. Even more curious is the fact that I keep getting errors when trying to renew my Premium subscription, and because it's expired, I'm now getting ads. I've emailed Mood support but have received no response. How can a company run when users can't pay them?",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I'll be honest, I love this app. It actually lets me send group messages, I love the themes feature, overall it's a very enjoyable experience. I started having issues when it began managing my phone calls. Not hugely, I just had no desire to be redirected to my messaging app after calling someone. Easy fix, I just removed their permission to access my calls app. And now I'm not allowed back inside the app without that permission. Not a huge issue, but enough to convince me to find a new app.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like the app a lot, I was having a hard time with messages app crashing and happened upon this. It's been a lot of fun to use, however when I create a group message with only two other people it always separates the responses (even when turning the group message on). Three or more people works fine, I would really just like the two person group message to work.",4
com.calea.echo,Al Mag,"Awful!!!!! App suddenly decided it had to be the default message app...which it already was! It completely locked up even after several reboots and only decided to work if permission was granted for it to take over the device's display and give itself priority over anything else on the screen, regardless of what other apps were running. Try driving on a highway with a Waze map that's suddenly blocked by stupid texts you can't hide or ignore. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Do not install!",1
com.calea.echo,Rita Austin,I deleted this app because lately I haven't been able to receive notifications when the setting is on. I also can't stand the ads I've been getting. I can't do anything without it poping up. It can't handle group chats bigger than 4 without having me receive them completely out of order or freezing and restarting. I have another issue where I was checking for a message and a notice came up about a free trial almost being up and having to pay later. That's not what I downloaded this app for.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,So Bummed. I have had this app for a couple of years now and have absolutely loved it. But in the last month I have had nothing but issues and crashes. Double texting. No GIFs. Failed messages. Closing and restarting the app. My friends are annoyed and so am I. I have reached out 2x through the app and also on FB messenger and no response or attempt to help me solve this. I want love this app again but I'm going to have to dump it if I can't get support. COME ON MOOD!!,2
com.calea.echo,kate barber,I have used this app for a few years and used to love it but since the last update I am so annoyed and beginning to hate it. Now I am unable to use the quick compose feature. I turn it on and it works for maybe 2 minutes and goes away. I have tried to change settings etc. and nothing works! Also any emoji i get does not show up it comes as a random circle with 2 dots. If those issues don't change soon I will be finding another messaging app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Uninstalling until the caller ID function is removed or you have the ability to turn it off. Multiple complaints of this feature and the developers/support are just telling users to turn it off when you can't, it just re-enables everything you turned off.

When activated, the font size can be adjusted in a message chat using the volume up and down buttons!",5

People text me but I don't see them hit my phone until I open the app. Two is this caller ID thing with after-call info and no way to disable it. It says it's disabled, but still operates. Annoying as hell. These need to be remedied or I'm going to look for another comparable messenger.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to love it. But now the ad driven version has replaced the initial free version. In a market that's flooded with messaging apps, this seems to be a self inflicted, totally unthinkable move development.

I tried quite a few alternatives to the Android message app and this is the absolute best one.

Today I sent out a text message that was supposed to go to each recipient individually, but it went out as a group message. Anyone who knows me knows that I HATE group messages. No one wants to receive a random text at 2 am from some unknown persom replying to a mass text. I specifically chose the option to send to multiple people and receive individual responses, and I got group responses. I just uninstalled.",3
com.calea.echo,Kimberly Powell,"Absolutely used to love this app. It was the best app for blacklisting, scheduling, customization, secret mode, and basically everything. Sadly the new updates force unwelcomed changes, having to post even the smallest of clips to YouTube, where other apps allow you to send them. Pictures not being able to be sent. I have had to download the textra app for all clips and pictures. It's sad really. Even the basic messaging phone app allows better picture and videos to be sent. And now the review",1

No other texting app I've used needed all this maintenance.

There are better apps that show your messages, don't kill your battery, and actually work correctly.",2

com.calea.echo,TeenyStudio Flicks,"The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see.

I'd love to know when the texts actually come through, not 6 hours later. I'm on a Samsung s10+ I'd really love to see this bug fixed asap or I'm going to have to try another app. Thanks.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It used to be a great app. Now not so much. Notufications don't pop up on screen, not even the head notidication! The screen doesn't wake up when a message is received. Customer support non existing. I wanted to pay for the subscription, now I'm glad I did not do it! I gave it two stars because I still like the app and is between the best SMS options but you should fix issues!",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Just downloaded this app a few days ago and it was working great, purchased the lifetime license then a day later all of my messages are stating failed on my end but the receivers are getting them. Some ppl in my group chat started sending me individual MMS downloads that would fail. Checked and adjusted all the settings to try & fix the issue to no avail. It has gotten so bad I removed it. I've sent support emails with no response. I want a refund!",1
com.calea.echo,Tee,"No way to disable this stupid Caller ID that takes over your screen after every call. It's interfering with my job because I use my phone for work and GPS and the Caller ID keeps popping up over everything. It shows its not even enabled in settings but yet still keeps popping up. The toggle to turn it on and off doesn't even work. Thought maybe switching it on then switching it off would work, but it doesn't even toggle and it isn't even on! Idk why they won't fix this.",1
com.calea.echo,Teddy J,"Extremely disappointed by the recent addition of notification ads. I don't want you sending me random clickbait garbage while I'm not even using your app. Not to mention, the notifications are set up in a way I can only assume is deliberate to make it unclear what app is sending them - the app icon is hidden, no mention of Mood in the text. I'm willing to put up with a lot but this is genuinely shameless and I'm not accepting it - been using the app for years but this is an instant uninstall.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This app use to work great on my last 2 devices. Since I have installed it on my new phone, it has been terrible!! The MMS messages won't download, and my photos won't even come up when I am trying to attach and send them. What is going on???üëéüëé *UPDATE* Both of those settings were checked multiple times, and it's still not working properly. I am no longer using this app!!!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I ‚ù§Ô∏è this app again (they fixed the receiving issue!). I like all the customization options & the msg alert sound notifications for different contacts. I've been using for about 9 months; so I've had time to form an opinion based on performance. The only time I've had an issue was 2 updates ago when the sound for received msgs went away. Luckily after complaining by many of us they got it fixed. I definitely don't like my back up msg app!,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Last update ruined app. I can no longer send/recieve texts. My notifications stopped working. I have been using this app for years and then it stopped working. I have a S10+ and I would love to keep using it if it started working again. This seems to happen everytime you guys do an update. It's so frustrating.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Anyone can help me with my notifications? I used to have the edge light working, plus the notification on top(like a bubble) not the icon. Now all of a sudden, I just get the icon at the top left, edge lighting(enable) doesn't show, and the notification bubble doesn't show. I cant seem to figure it out. Any help will be appreciated!",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"After the last update, none of my individual notifications for texts are working. I have submitted a ticket through their website, and no response at all. It has worked perfectly for the last year or so, and I love the app, thus why I bought the premium version. But this may make me go to another one if not fixed soon.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Too many issues with this app. One day it downloads photos, the next it doesn't. I'm always messing with the SMS MMS trying to find its sweet spot so it will be consistent. I've yet to find it. I switch over to my basic texting app that came with my phone to view any photos received. So I've needed two messaging apps to handle the job. Today I'm finding one texting app that will do it all, then I'll completely uninstall Mood. Buh bye.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Tried a lot of different messaging apps and I always come back to Mood because I love the features: the secret/private folder that you can even secure with a finger print (securely hidden for those private chats with contacts), all the customizable features it allows, the different themes you can choose from, the huge selection of backgrounds to choose from or choose your own, and much, much more I could brag about. One of the best for the price compared to competitors! Great app! üéâüéâüéâ",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Been a big fan of Mood and have used it on two phones now.  But recently I have only started getting texts in bursts.  Texts sent several minutes to hours ago won't come in until I get a bunch all at once.  Since I use my phone at work and also have a teenager, not getting texts in a timely manner is a big issue. Until this is resolved, I have no other choice but to move to another app.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Well I was enjoying mood, I think the stickers they provide are hilarious and liked the layout... But then it started with this caller ID pop-up AFTER every call- why? It's just one more thing I have to close. What is the point of that! And then this new update brought a super annoying ad banner at the top of my texts! And I've had issues with group texting forever--I wouldn't get messages for hours after the conversation happened, and a jumbled out of order. Deleting and finding a new app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Ever since the update on the 19th I don't receive sound notifications or head bar notifications. I've uninstall/reinstall, soft reboot and hard. Nothing. Then the update on the 24th didn't fix anything and I've tried everything.

Until then you get 1 star.",1
com.calea.echo,Sarah Callaway,"No longer works, used to be amazing. Fun & great features but now emojis come through as circles with 3 dots, pictures wont send, shows 'mms failed' and half of the time gifs don't send or receive. I have to open the app to see I have an MMS, then it downloads showing the current time not when it was actually sent. I deleted & reinstalled, edited every setting in the app and my phone but still not working. Go to app for years but moving on, will try again in a few months. ü§û devs I ‚ù§& need this!",1
com.calea.echo,Greg Kollatz,Used to be great. Has become more and more intrusive and annoying as the app tries to increase advertising. Also this is a text message app but it started to try doing stuff with phone calls and is annoying and hard to trust. I uninstalled. Might be better off with a paid app that just does what you want with no interference or unexpected new behavior.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Have used this app for years. usually love it. however lately, I'm not getting notifications until I actually open the app. I hit the icon and all.of a sudden I have 30 messages, all coming in at the same time. something isnt right here. I've read the other reviews and tried all of the fixes listed in the developer comments but still only notifying me every so often.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love this app! It works flawlessly on my Samsung S8. My messaging with TMobile will NOT work correctly, and this gives me a GREAT work around. It works with DIGITS, so all comes thru to my US Cellular phone. It has this great option to convert MMS into multiple SMS if you need to, and since the tmobile network will NOT send my MMS correctly, this is just PERFECT! THIS is my business phone, so this has really saved my bacon! The emoticons really emote, lol! I'll never go back to their built in app. Haven't tried voice and file sharing, but I may put it on my kindle just to see what happens! Thanks guys!",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Very detailed customization experience. In that I think this app has no equal. However, I have a problem where larger texts I send or receive show up as multiple small texts and for the life of me I can't fix it. Tried contacting the developers several months ago and still no answer. I had a 5 star review before that happened, but since they ignored me I'm kinda ticked.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,This application was cool at first. I really enjoyed the fact that I could customize it easily and the emojis are cool. BUT. At one point the MMS stopped working. Can't send/can't receive. I emailed them 3 times. Absolutely no reply. I find it disappointing but the lack of support is enough to make me uninstall it. Was fun while it lasted,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"There are alot of fun qualities to the app..great emojis and customizations and looks available. But there is huge wonkiness with MMS. For me, it makes it unusable. pictures often don't come through when someone sends them, it throws a weird MMS error..and some messages are completely lost or missed. What in the world. I finally just switched to another app and everything comes in fine. Not sure how many things I missed while using Mood. The lack of MMS reliability is a deal breaker for me.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Will change to a 5 star when they put back the ability to receive notification sounds. It happened after this last update. I have been using this app for about 3 years now and I love it! I love the practically limitless customizable options, but I hate that I don't receive text notifications anymore. Was the best now not so much. Older version was better. Update 4/26/19 just lost the floating notification function. Fix both and 5 stars is yours",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Got to love it for a while anyway :( I downloaded Mood because I wanted to customize my interface (s) for texting. But as everyone else is saying, this new app with the ad banner really ruins it. In my case, the phone is undeniably MUCH slower waiting for that banner to load, so trying to open any text, let alone switch between a few in a minute, is very unreliable and irritating. I'm gonna have to uninstall at this point. I was holding out but I'm done putting up with all this lag for an AD!!!",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I loved Mood because I was able to have the chat head notifications that didn't show a preview of the text (without turning the preview off). This worked great because I didn't want the messages to pop up on screen but I was still able to read them on my Galaxy watch. Now chat heads don't work and I have to allow all content to be displayed once received (not cool when showing someone your phone and a private msg pops up). Please fix this!! I have to use another app now.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This does what all text apps do, and it does that very, very well. What makes it even better are the customizations. You can have it as plain and utilitarian as you might want, or you can make it look and feel exactly as the builder in you wants to construct it. If it made it easier to see all the names and numbers of group text participants, I would be ecstatic. (I keep another app on my phone because it does this one thing better) But I'm never giving up Mood. It's just too good to let go.",5
com.calea.echo,Nicole S.,"I used to love this App, until the last few updates. I get double notification windows which are super annoying, there are emojis missing from before (just shows a circle made of yellow dashes), and now I can't send a video without needing a YouTube channel?!?!? Are you kidding me??? Guess I'll start looking for a new text app if these things can't be fixed.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Final Edit: New update has solved the issue, thank you! 1 Star until you fix sound notifications. This is the second time your update has caused this issue. Every other messaging app works just fine. Yes I've forced closed, yes I've rebooted, yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled, your app is currently failing and clearly I'm not alone. Edit: Yes i checked ""play notification through headset"" as you suggested, no it did not work.",5
com.calea.echo,AKA e-chollie,"I have used mood for years. In an auto update a couple of days ago, it has completely changed its appearance where the text is the same color as the background on the chat listing and i am apparently unable to change it. Also, it has hijacked my phone. I have a phone app, as all androids have. I do not wish for a text app for redundancy of phone operations. Because this has all happened without my consent and i cannot disable these changes, i have decided to uninstall my premium mood app",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I LOVED this app until the latest update. The caller ID feature is unnecessary and interferes with me answering my phone, making me miss my call. I don't need it to pop up with a notification about who I just spoke to on the phone... Just stop. Remove the caller ID feature so I can use the awesome app again. Thank you for updating the feature. I updated my review. üòä Now that I can turn off the caller ID, I really enjoy the app!",5
com.calea.echo,Joseph Clark,UPDATE: 07/05. Some issues have been resolved but now the lifetime membership is gone and you can't resubscribe. Also the app has become completely unusable. It has so much lag that it takes so long for the keyboard to respond while typing. Everytime they update it just gets worse and more unstable. 2.3e in May was awesome! This newest update is so bad that I have to go to a different app. Please fix the severe lagg and the paying for your subscription issues.,1
com.calea.echo,Kim Chapman,"This used to be my favorite texting app, but l have deleted it because it has so many problems. I was receiving the same text 5 times, it took forever to send a picture (if it would go...I sometimes would get a ""failed notification"" but my receiver had actually gotten it). I was also receiving messages about 15 minutes late. I've tried reinstalling and it would work for a while and then fail me again. I'm a premium user...sorry I spent the $$$. Needs LOTS of work!",1
com.calea.echo,Cheryl-Ann Kashiwamura,Updated 8JAN20: This app is very frustrating! It constantly sends my messages way later than wen it was sent. It won't send the messages until I open the app so I never know when people actually text me. UNINSTALLED APP! NOT WORTH THE HASSLE! The app keeps sending me messages with a link (that you can't even Google) without a phone number attached. Obviously I'm not stupid enough to click it but I would like it to stop.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Textra incoming messages has no notification sound. A few years of this was enough so I searched for an alternative. Sure glad I dug in and searched to find this Mood treasure that the sound works along with jewels that Textra don't have. I been set free. What I don't like is the microphone icon right next to the send off message where I accidentally hit many times. I'm hoping one day to see it there no longer. Thanks creators!,5
com.calea.echo,Amanda Bower,"Have had Mood for years and I'm a lifetime subscriber. I love it...HOWEVER the last few updates have ruined a perfectly good app. Texting window for the caller pops up after every phone call and texts are stamped with the time they were supposed to be delivered, but they're unreliably delivered minutes later. I shouldn't have to check my app multiple times in order to get my messages to come through...ended up going back to my stock messaging app until they fix their issues.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Honestly the best of the third party apps out there. BUT. Customer service through their support email is non existent, so I'm left unable to send pictures taken by my phone camera, and videos that are sent to me through this app are low quality to the point of being unwatchable.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"The customization options are great and I enjoyed using this for quite some time. Then suddenly, I was getting texts *hours* after they'd been sent to me and it was causing problems so I switched back to my stock messaging but kept mood on my phone. Randomly started being spammed with stupid texts. The most recent one was about buying books or something. And I know it's coming directly from something related to mood, because it's not showing up in my stock messenger. Deleted.",2

However, I cant seem to find an option to remove the quick reply menu from the status bar on top, and still be able to use it in the drag down menu where my notifications are.

It just simply does not work any longer! Its performance is very laggy! It doesn't respond to any selections I try to make which includes trying to compose a message! I had uninstalled it & reinstalled it 5 times--setting it up as a new setup! But no change! Please repair this!",1

I can only see downhill until they fix these 2 issues. Done with the app.",1

Like, right away! It's super annoying. Update: 7/17/20... The newest update causes the notification icon to stay in the upper part of my phone until I actually tap on it. Even if I swipe it away, or even go into the app and read the new text, that icon stays there until I tap on the actual notification. Pretty stupid.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love this app. However it stops receiving incoming messages and images randomly. Today I got 4 images that were suppose to be sent with text early in the week.

MMS are not staying grouped into a single thread, now, and get broken up into 3-5 separate threads, with each containing some messages from the original thread. I have also started receiving random notifications, with no actual messages showing up. And, more and more, people are sending me text messages that I never receive. Also, the new ad bar is terrible, and no one responds to the numerous e-mails I have sent for help.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Absolutely loving this app! Great themes and customization options, as well as fonts and custom gifs! Only issues I've noticed are the ""assistance"" zendesk server being down and notifications are grouped to the app, not the message, so the moment you open the app it clears all the notifications, regardless if you've read the message or not. Love it though!",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Mood Messenger is so cool. I'd give it 5 stars, and love it even more if i were able to change the background for the chat list, use custom fonts (other than pre-installed), if i were able to see the recipient typing, and I were able to see when my messages were ""delivered"", and """"read"" (just like iphone users).

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This app, while fairly high rated, added a number of extra advertising screens to the process of answering and ending calls. Why a texting app would screw up phone use is beyond me. Anyway, before I installed Mood I could answer the phone with 1 click. After, it took multiple clicks & other gestures to get the phone answered - sometimes it switched over to voicemail before I could get the thing answered. And when ending a call it would bring up an extra screen with unwanted data and ads.",1

It has its uses, and it's easy enough to close if I don't want it up, but what's really annoying is the half page ad that's on the screen every time it pops up. It blocks like half the texts. I would gladly pay for a premium version to remove the ads, but there isn't one so I am considering uninstalling.",3

You have to manually clear them.",3

You can customize any aspect of your messaging - chat list, keyboard, fonts, colors, backgrounds, ringtones, etc - & each individual chat can be unique in appearance & ringtone. You can lock messages, block numbers, password protect & has tons of extras - like GIFs, Drawing, Games - even features I've never even looked into.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,They have double downed on the ads. I will open the app and then sometimes wait over 60 seconds for app to load. Then after the app loads it takes a couple more seconds for the ad to load. Which consequently actually will cause all of your text message threads to drop a quarter of an inch. And if you don't time it right you'll accidentally tap on the wrong thread and open up the wrong persons message. I am officially removing this app.,1

Problem is, when you access your phone's gallery, it only lets you choose from the most recent THIRTY images in gallery.

I installed this on a newer os on my redmi note 7, and now whenever someone calls I get a floating caller ID box, which turns into an ad as soon as the call is over. Really ugly, I hate looking at ads when doing normal phone functions. I considered paying for the pro version, but it's a little pricey at $10.99 and it's hard to tell if that will fix the ad problem. *phone call permission must be selected for app to work",2

Look into this, if it works ill put 5 stars again. Because I really like this app.",2

I love it so much that I disabled my default message app the second I experimented with the color changing because I noticed right away it that it's far from low budget. It's better than all customize sms theme apps I have used in the past. I'm glad that I found this. No ads. No colorful childish looking odd cartoon app logo to ruin your theme. Just the small app's cloud logo. Which blends in very well and doesn't look cheap and childlike. I love it and you will too! Go for it!,5

I can't figure out how to detach Mood from my phone service. I don't want any interference with my phone calls from my messaging service at all. The only reason I use Mood is because the default service on my phone no longer let me assign specific notification tones to my contacts and Mood did, but this isn't worth it.

I had to reset every individual contact to a notification. also I cannot find custom ring tone creating options any where. What happened to this great app? (Samsung 9+),1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,love it! UPDATE: I've been having issues for about 4 days now with FAILED to send messages. I love this APP and really want to return it to a 5 star review. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. Please fix this issue. I'm not having the same issue with the standard messaging app that comes on the phone.,3
com.calea.echo,Brenda Sanders,I used to love this app! However my love for it has died. I paid for this at least 4 phones ago and it has worked flawlessly until my galaxy S21. Now I can't get MMS to send or receive. It repeatedly freezes up. I uninstall it and all of my features work flawlessly with the stock message app. I miss the color and the features of keeping my messages seemingly forever. I hope they get these bugs fixed because I want to be in love with it again.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I loved this app until recently where I can no longer seem to take screenshots. I keep getting an error """"Can't take screenshot due to security policy""   The support from them is 7 days now un-answered  If not for that it would be 5 stars.   EDIT: Had to got to advanced settings, do a ""Reset Settings"" to make it work a again. Lost all customizations but its woking again.  No help from their support (as well as 2 other 7 day unanswered messages) only reason stopping me from rating 5 stars).",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Experience is decent but not flawless and not as ergonomically friendly as it could be when diving deep into settings. connectivity has hiccups at times. I'm still a fan but serious attention is still needed on the aforementioned. downgraded to two stars since the connectivity issues are still present on my new device.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Used this app for years and LOVED it until just before the update. My messages were not showing until I opened the app and then the forced update placed that as banner taking up more slave than two conversations. Understand that ads being in revenue but other apps manage to place at the bottom and takes up minimal space. Will miss the ability to have backgrounds and the customizations but will be switching to another app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,UPDATE: The app has gone downhill. üò¢ All of sudden the notification sounds stop working. Actually even the notifications stop working altogether. I would have to wake the phone in order for notifications to come thru. I used to really enjoy this app. But I had to uninstall Team whats going on? None of the background are working. every time I select a customized background for one of my contacts it end up being the same background for all of my contacts and this is not good please help,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Decent app, but what annoys me about it is the fact that it's doing way too much. Why would i want my text message app to also perform caller id for incoming calls? Not only is it unsettling from a privacy POV but it's frustrating cause it seems as if it's a package deal. For every incoming call, you get a pop up that takes the whole screen prompting you to send a text message to the last incoming call requiring 2 extra steps to get back to what u were doing...Why? Deleting soon",1
com.calea.echo,Jessica Capstick,"I have used this app for years, with several different phones and never had issues with it until this newest phone.

Still continuing to have issues with this, and no help! MMS comes through on my other message apps....",1
com.calea.echo,Bridger Keeton,"Text messages dont show up until I open the app itself. Recieving messages should be the main feature of text messaging apps. Not only do I have to open up the app for messages, sometimes messages dont show up for a day/hours if I open it up and that's unacceptable, stay away from this one until it's fixed. It seems like the other core features of this app are broken too like emojis so why even bother getting this one anymore.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Really annoying app. Used it for over a year. In a recent update, the app forcefully managed my phone calls...even though I didn't give it permission to do so.

The only problem is I can't figure out the setting to show there are messages waiting without opening the app. It worked at one point. I must have messed up.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Still decent app, but for the past couple weeks incoming messages are delayed. I look and nothing is there... confirmed with sender that they show delivered, then I go back and look later and the message is there, with the original time. Quite unnerving.

Please fix this, I'm tired of dealing with problems with this app.",1
com.calea.echo,T. Lett,Going downhill - can't receive mms! Was great for years. Past week it has gone bonkers. No group texts are working. Can't receive any messages at all. Works fine on other messaging apps. I adore Mood's background features- can't find it anywhere else. But seems like developers maybe aren't keeping up with Android updates? Very sad to lose this once amazing app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Soooooo awesome !!!! I am reading other people's complaints about the app but I have not had any issues. Sometimes a text doesn't send right away but I had problems like that on my built in message app too. I find the ability to customize the best part of the app and I am so happy that I found this . Totally worth the money and I'm enjoying it immensely , esp since I text so much !!! Love it",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Best text messaging app I've ever used. I use the free version and I've never felt like I needed to upgrade to premium to get a great experience.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like this app except for a very disturbing flaw.... After I send a text message to someone, the screen flips back to the conversation I had with the previous person. Because of this, I accidentally sent a message to the wrong person (and it was very inappropriate for that person). Please fix this bug!",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"vast improvement, more customizability than any app ive ever seen. Edit, mms settings are a nightmare and i am unable to send pictures and media without having to flip a switch to change from drive to file, i saw a screen pop up asking what my preference is but i accidentally tapped something and now its stuck on drive when i first select a file and i cant find the setting to change it, if i cant find a fix i think ill uninstall because its highly annoying",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Pretty good app only irritation is when a text comes in and the text bubble comes up and you reply...it doesn't open the same conversation in the actual app. So when you go to continue the conversation in depth via app (pop up disappears after one reply) it doesn't trigger that conversation. So you can accidentally send a text to another person,4
com.calea.echo,Linda in Colorado,"The app that came with the phone never worked so I got Mood. It works about 2/3 of the time. When it doesn't I reboot it. Mostly it's good and the stickers and emojis are fun, except for the Trump-emojis. How can I get rid of those? Why are they even there? I took off one star because of those. Update: for 2 days I have had so much trouble sending texts that I am going to look for a different app. I have had trouble sending pictures for about 3 weeks.",2

Now messages don't get recieved, I don't get notifications no matter what settings I use (it could be hours before I recieve the text and if I get a notification it is only when i open the app) It could be that the app is incompatible with the s10 and current os since other apps work just fine.

com.calea.echo,Raya and Deano Burke,"This used to be a good replacement app, but each ""bug fix"" is another adware addition.

Searching for a new app now, don't use this one.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Honestly, I like this app. I really do. I like how it's customisable and that I can give it the personality others lack. Having my own background and tones for each person I contact along with their own bubbles for chat. However, the thing holding me back from really loving it is the fact that not all my messages go through to the people I'm speaking with. It's not my network, I've already contacted them, it's an error on the app's part. I don't know if it's because I have an older phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) that's the problem or what but honestly, this is the only issue I find. I like that Mood is lightweight and just gets the job done when it works.",3

Go to click on a message and it moves.",1

Have not been receiving my texts very glitchy text that I send send multiple times at once. Have to close the app and reopen it received text or unlock my phone. Deserves 5 stars once all the important stuff is fixed. Because I'm changing apps now so sending or receiving texts really is the most important everything else is a bonus.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Now ever since the recent update it says i have a message but really i don't. In order to get rid of that alert saying i do i have to restart my phone. I also don't hear the notifications. Not a very good update. Deleted messages keep coming back. Should of left it alone. problem is the message doesn't send right away. I have to hit the back button see the check mark that shows it was sent then go back in again. It tends to be annoying.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"My favorite android messaging app - I like that it's easy to share multiple photos and customize colors and themes. I'm not a fan of the method of creating group chat.

com.calea.echo,Char Smith,"Mood from a couple years ago was great. Not only are there ads now, but Mood gave itself autonomous permission to allow adware to send me push notifications. Took me forever to finally ferret out it was coming from Mood. With the 7/28/20 update, Mood constantly crashes. When I apply a theme (one of the reasons I chose Mood), it applies the theme's ""universal settings"" to every single one of my custom-contact settings. I no longer have the ability to send YouTube vids. This app has become trash.",1

I looked around and found this and I'm glad I decided to download it. It is one of the best messenger apps out there, the features to this app are phenomenal! I love the quick reply because when I reply it automatically gets rid of the message screen as soon as I send the message which is GREAT!!! I love the ustom text tones I can apply to each and every contact if I wanted to, I also love the dark theme because for someone like me (legally blind) the dark mode makes the screen look a lot better.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,The interface is ok and has a bunch of customizable themes. Some of my previous sent/received messages did not appear in the app. The free version does not seem to include RCS/Chat over WiFi. Not sure if the premium version has that option but not willing to pay when I have a free stock messaging app. Reason for 2 stars. Uninstalled.,2

And it wasn't a link she had to click on, it just sent to her phone as a normal text. So I am impressed so far. Would like option to open a chat head myself and keep it open like Facebook does.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,I understand ads popping up as banners when I'm in the app BUT you don't need to be allowing companies to send out ads to my contacts NOR should you be sending ads to me via text msgs. I will go back to my default messaging app if this problem continues. What does the in-app purchase cover? Some apps will allow you to buy the pro version to go ad free but I just don't want the ads sent to me or my contacts. I just got an ad for a weight loss prog. I don't need my friends/fam to believe I am sending them ads. They will block me believing they are blocking the ads. This needs to be fixed!,2

Going to be very dull with a standard messenger,2
com.calea.echo,Gary Cavallo,"I've been using Mood for years and loved the overall aesthetic, design including customization options and built in Giphy support. However, the updates recently have been a little shotty. The update before last caused a significant amount of lag. The most recent update fixed the lag but now I don't receive texts until I actually open the app. Very unfortunate. The updates need to start being constantly stable for me to increase my rating. Still having the same problems today even after update...",3
com.calea.echo,Relyc Matoaka,"Love this app and all it's customization features. Individual ringtones, notifications, text, bubbles, icons, and backgrounds? Control over ever aspect of my nessaging experience? I am in love and have gotten 2 others to download it and love it. I'm going to save up and buy the lifetime premium version at some point because this is my favourite app :) *Update: as of 2 updates ago I no longer have access to the app or any of my messages. Hope support release a fix cuz I don't wanna uninstall :(",3

They won't send & have to retype, then copy in case it disappears again. 2 msgs in group threads show up as mms from the individual person that must be downloaded & then they go to group thread. 3 videos are always ""too big"" to send, even if taken in app & are only 2sec long 4 open app & click a thread & nothing happens, have to close & reopen app 5 deleted msgs reappear Same issues on 2 phones Sam galaxy note10+ & galaxy s20",1
com.calea.echo,Norma Cooney,Sept 30/22 - Well I believe it is time to move on from this app. The ads are back now and again and I don't understand all that stuff after every phone call so I'm movin' on. Sept 7/22 -UPDATE I have started getting ads again. This does not make me happy. Please fix. I did love mood. It was fun. It wouldnt accept Canada as a country for me to put in my phone #.

com.calea.echo,KoshaT JGW,"This app is horrible. Every new update makes this app more and more useless. All the updates seem to do are make the ads bigger, slow down the message sending, and freezes up my phone. There is no point in a messaging app if it freezes up a phone. There is also the problem of the app not delivering my messages to me. üëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæ. I won't be recommending this app to anyone.",1

I like the app, but the lack of response tells me you're starting to ignore it. That's not cool. Please don't ask me to email you. I already have. Look in your queue or ignore my message. I have experience with that.",3

com.calea.echo,Jason Russell,"I've used Mood on my last 4 cell phones and I personally think it's the most complete and useful messaging app out there.

com.calea.echo,John J,Last update has caused it glitch and not work properly. You press the letter or number and it takes at least 2 seconds for it to type it out. Update: almost a month later and absolutely no change or update to fix the issues. Get yourself a different texting app!,1
com.calea.echo,Brodie Gardner,Work pretty well and enjoying all the customization features. I did get lifetime premium. Better the near every texting app just wish it had RCS support.

Now I don't pics that are sent to me. Apparently has something to do with MMS. I have to go into a totally different app to see them. Emailing customer service is worthless. Won't give me a number to talk to a live person to try to figure this out. I guess I'm going to have to get used to a new app. Very disappointed and frustrated.",1
com.calea.echo,Eugene Wilson,"Good app...and it solid compared against Textra. So far no ads in this app. It doesn't offer emoji reaction support on messages like IOS and Textra. Mood is very customizable with themes/backgrounds, offers secure encryption and private message lock. It doesn't look like you can ""Schedule"" a message from the free version. Overall a good app, It only needs emoji reaction message support!!!!",4
com.calea.echo,D.a.m. Mortimer,I've had mood for many years and at first it was great work fine for quite a while and then I changed to a new phone and it refused to restore my premium membership I got kind of smart alec remarks from the support team and I was finally recognized as a premium member and told what to do to restore my premium membership and it didn't restore it it ended up deleting several of the contacts I've had nothing but issues I'm extremely dissatisfied I would not recommend this app for any reason!,1
com.calea.echo,Matthew Lemmers,"This is a pretty great messages application for the most part. It seems that the original creator of the application must've sold it to this new glad apps company. That being said, clearly this application must be meant more for overseas markets judging by the fact that the RCS features are offered only by European carriers. My only real gripe with the application is the it doesn't allow you to use stock system emoji. You are stuck with the ugly ones this app uses.",4
com.calea.echo,Barbara Tafoya (SIXPAKLADY),I really love this app. There was a problem with the last update. The developers took care of the problem. Thank you for such an innovative texting app. ü•∞,5

com.calea.echo,olo,So I paid the money to get rid of the ads a few years ago until this day I still regret it. It is the only reason why I still use it because the amount of money I spent.

I've confirmed with friends that my messages haven't been sending. But when I switch to the stock SMS app, I'm having no issues. I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, tweaking every setting. No change.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Been using it for almost 3 years now. Loved the customization and the features that make it convenient to use but lately I've been getting texts late.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I have a bad feeling about this app. Let me get the positive out of the way, this app is absolutely glorious and everyone should get rid of their default SMS app in favour of this, it's clean, fast, responsive and very customisable, absolutely everything you could want from an SMS app. HOWEVER, since a few days ago they've started to put things behind a pay wall, which is absolute fine of course, developers can do what they want. However, some of the features behind that pay wall were previously free and one of the concerns is it keeps spamming adverts to upgrade to premium! Where you go to upgrade to premium it states that the subscription involves not seeing ads, now I'm not seeing ads yet but I can promise if they start showing up I will be reverting, it's a great SMS app but all of the ""premium features"" are already integrated into other apps for free or you can easily use a separate application (Like back up restore) Guys, I'm not meaning to be too critical, honestly if you made premium desirable I'd have no issues with supporting you by being a paid member, but you have to make it worth the costs with the competition being free or cheaper alternatives, you have a beautiful app but it doesn't justify the price you've put on it :( before this update it would have been 5 stars from me!",3

What really bothers me is that this app recently decided to add ads.

My only suggestion would be to add more realistic/HD themes for the layout. They haven't expanded much on those. Still give it 5 stars üòÉ",5
com.calea.echo,Fay Paszcza,"Love this app. A few minor bugs. Delayed messages and showing messages but not updating to contracts.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"There is one major problem. I can't send a group text message even with group chat enabled. I also dislike that you can't change background color after you set it. Otherwise, this messaging app is good. I appreciate that you can change font size. No group text messaging makes this app unusable for me.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This is THE best texting app I've ever used. There aren't any ads, there aren't any add-on apps you have to download, and you can customize ANYTHING you want! You can individualize every aspect of the background, font and conversation bubbles of each contact that you text! I love it!",5
com.calea.echo,Georgetta Mccloud,I use the love this app . i really hate that after a call the message pop up. Its very annoying. Thats just one of the things. But right now thats the most important. And also i dont see the typing indictor when someone is typing back. Please fix and update. I would hate to switch... Also why ehen im tryung to upgrade to the premium plan no ads i keep getting error messages. Update on app 7/12/2022 since the laat update it did now its really acting stupid. Idk what is going on but im deleting it,2
com.calea.echo,Tereecea Dornbusch,I've been a fan of mood for years and have been recommending it to everyone but now when I need it it is acting up. This has been a very frustrating experience as I have an important meeting and lots of people to text. I have no idea how to resolve this issue so I'm putting it out there. still glitching still haven't heard anything still very disappointed Will no longer recommend this app. Several missed texts today caused me a lot of problems. not one word from you guys shame shame shame,2
com.calea.echo,R. Lacy,"It keeps freezing. With EVERY update comes issues. Been having mood for a long time and it just doesn't function as it used to. When I first started using this app, gave it practically 5 stars. However, there are just to many problems. In fact, my sister had Mood and she went to another app because of the problems she was having. The app she currently has now is so customizable that she can actually put on clothing from her closet with her app, And a lot of the emojis are NOT available anymore.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've had this app for the past year and was in love up until the last update. My floating notification is no longer showing on my phone ever since the upgrade. I've followed all the directions about permissions etc and none of it is working. Again let me reiterate that it was working perfect until this last update. I reached out to their customer service thru email 3 times no response. Apparently something changed that made this happen. It was working fine up until this last most recent update. Not sure how long i will be using the app but i am disappointed at whatever they changed because its just not working no matter what i do, setting and permission , tried to disable in the notification and reactivate and it only says disable at all times. just irritated at this point, was the best messaging app by far now not so much   Revised 2/19/19 Thank you for your response but i dont speak french , english only  and i translated it and that is not helping either. No notification are working still",3
com.calea.echo,H.L. Cloy,My rating for this app has changed. The app now forces the overlay option on users. The user can no longer decline overlay. Overlay causes my phone to reboot each time I receive a text. This is not a good feature.,2

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Update ** after an email from eveloper and where I needed to make sure my setting was correct it's back to functioning how I was use too. Love it. Thanks for the good customer service. I use to love this app, with the new update. I no longer get the number badge notification. I have uninstalled and tried again and still no small red number shows up. I'm annoyed and will probably u install to find something else.",5
com.calea.echo,T. Allen,"While I love Mood. I hate thr latest update. The new update made me enable overlay and now I get two notifications per text and can no longer access the configuration to disable the option. This overlay has also enable the after call display which l, once again cannot disable. The fully customizable aspect of Mood was the main reason I have been a loyal user for well over 3yrs; however these new annoyances are making me debate removing the app from my phone.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I typically have no issues with this app. Recently though every time I send an image to someone it is showing up in other peoples messages. It is the most annoying thing ever. Also I upgraded to the paid version of the app and you ""get access"" to premium themes.. which is about 7 of them, Not sure how that is a selling point. also why is mood opening after every every call, received, dialed or missed? if I wanted to text them I would, it doesn't need to open on it's own.",4
com.calea.echo,New Brew,"Slowly breaks down your phone, causing overheating, lagging, other apps to crash, eventually the app itself decides to work when it wants to. I had it for 3yrs love it at first gave it a 5 star review but every update made it worse now it's unusable, can't send photos or videos can't like messages it's just outdated now, and the fuxking ads that started texting me but the 100s and sending me ad notications it's a terrible app now",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I am so happy with this app. This was my first attempt at using something other than the default proprietary txt app, and it's a grand slam. I thought I was going to have to install 20 apps before finding something decent. I picked a winner first try. Customize every detail, cool options and settings, great selection of stock items. Mood is perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Edit: I'd like to pay for my lifetime sub in crypto, please !",5
com.calea.echo,Wesley Miller,I've tried other customization apps like Mood before..but they were very buggy and didn't real deliver..mood does! nice work!!,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Update to previous review; after a few days of using the app: In addition to the new font size control being too small to read even at the max setting now. My premium service that I paid for has disappeared. Funny I do not recall them stating that if you pay for premium service when a new update comes out that you have to pay again ? The ads are obtrusive and very irritating. I'm guessing that is why the font got smaller so they could squeeze in more advertisement to make money.. Sucks now!,1
com.calea.echo,tam strong,"I've used this app for quite awhile and was very happy until recently. I've dealt with the forced stops, the occasional non notifications, but now it's not working at all. For days it didn't notify me when I had new texts NOW I can even open a text to send a message! Ridiculous!",1
com.calea.echo,Ahmad Baratian,"Basic changes are needed in the ""Notifications"" section: - When receiving a new message, both the native Android notification and the application-specific ""Floating Notification"" are displayed together! - No notification or sound will be played when receiving new message from starred contacts when ""Do Not Disturb"" mode is enabled!

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Really liked this app before. Uninstalling. Reason: What were you thinking? Ad banner is in your face, purchase is way too high, and I don't know about anyone else, but this trend for ongoing subscription charges is for the birds. Not doing that anymore. Group messaging is difficult to configure and keep working reliably.",2
com.calea.echo,Jessica Y,Loved this app and have been using for a few years now. Just recently it started being really buggy. Not allowing me to close it and repeatedly opening back up until I can within a few seconds time force stop. Leaving my review as I just now am sending them a message to see if we can't resolve issue.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've tried all the other texting apps in the play store & zero compare to Mood & all the included features; my favorite part is just how customizable Mood is & I've turned every aspect into my own. UPDATE... UNINSTALLING after several years after the last two updates, I don't receive ANY texts; flash & vibration notification occur but no texts show up afterwards. Ads are dealbreaker for me ESPECIALLY if paying still WON'T remove them. I loved it & sad it's 100% unusable for me now üíî (fix?)",1

Try some test notifications to make sure. You still have to enable overlay but now you can use the app just as you were able to before without the annoying chat bubbles. And you can turn off caller ID functions in settings. Edit: overlay stuff are super annoying... -1 star",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used to love this app, but after Android 10 came out, notifications stopped working and then I stopped getting messages completely, and no amount of emailing or developer contact requests could get anyone to respond to me. I even paid for the app to see if that would work and it didn't, and no one will refund my money. Don't waste your time.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I have been using this app for about 9 months now and it used to be absolutely perfect. Now the new update, like everyone else has stated, has completely ruined it. I don't receive texts until I open the app to check and my text recipients now get a ""blocked message"" error when I text them from Mood. There's a saying that goes ""don't fix what isn't broken"" that I feel may apply to this new update. üòë",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be great, but now my messages come all at once and out of order so I can't keep up with group chats or normal conversations.

com.calea.echo,Lisa Nord,"This use to be my favorite texting app! Then I started not getting texts that people sent me & often I wouldn't get any notification that I received a text.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Not bad for an alternative sms app, the only issue for now. I've notice an issue where the ""adapt emoji for the font"" is not functioning well, although I saw the little ones but when I scroll to my old conversation, other emojis comes back to the ""small ones"" instead of adapting the font size. Overall, it's a nice sms app. Keep it up Devs! üòé",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Terrible tech support. Everytime I recieve a text I get a pop up requesting to ""Allow Mood to turn off wifi"". I've sent at least 4 emails thru the course of a week, requesting to know why that would be necessary and how to disable the pop up. Haven't recieved any response. I have to question the validity of other reviews that talk about getting tech support. Would rather have a texting app with decent tech support than one with annoying popups with every text .",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like this one better than Textra, although they're very similar. There are a plethora of options available to customize messages and/or chat! The only thing I'm disappointed with is that when I see ‚úì‚úì I assumed that it means msg sent‚úì and msg read‚úì but come to find out the 2nd ‚úì is actually reporting the message delivered. And one recipient seems to give me problems when i send photos, but I think it may be because I have that person hidden.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,The group MMS is hanging since I updated to the new system software 8. I loved it but I need to update family on some issues and need to know my text are getting there instead of checking to see if it sends and then getting a not sent message. It was also double sending at times in group messaging. I have to message 5 people and don't want to SMS message them in group. Which does work but then I get a ton of single messages back and I can't keep track of what they are answering to. I'd move back to this text app again if that worked. Right now I'm using the stock program. üòí,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Used this app for a long time but recently it stopped sending MMS. Not sure if that has to do with the recent update that added ads but it was about the same time. Absolutely useless without being able to send pictures. I will be uninstalling and looking for a new app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Since the update, my messages do not send at all. No check mark appears, only the 3 dots. After closing and restarting the app the message then disappears. Incoming messages will sometimes not be received unless I touch to unlock phone. Please fix! I really enjoyed this app.",3
com.calea.echo,David Kartchner,"This app used to be great. The latest update really screwed it up. The after-call message thing is totally annoying, especially if you use your phone a lot. It provides a lot of useless information and then you've got to clear it after every call you make. ARRRRRGH!!! I'm going to uninstall it and find another app because the irritation far exceeds the benefits the app used to provide.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"ok. i liked this for awhile, but the more i used it the less i liked it...it's pretty pathetic that a small sized 11 second video can't be send without MAJOR commission, or quality loss.

I upgraded from Samsung Galaxy S9 to the S21 recently. Thrilled that I go straight to the chat list than contact list. I am having problems receiving phoros. I have spent hours trying to fix the issue with tech coaches through Verizon (who have no idea what an SMSC number is). Looks like I am not the only one with this issue. * PLEASE FIX RECEIVE PHOTO MMS ISSUE FOR S21*,3
com.calea.echo,Lakeisha Woods,"I use to love this app, even paid for the upgrade but for the past few months it has started to go down hill fast! What happened to the emojis, the majority of them have dissapeared. Half the time I don't get my messages until hours later and they take forever to send. I am trying to be patient but this is annoying and ridiculous! (Update 10/30/20)As of this morning I deleted mood from my phone. The app has continued to go down hill after every update, this last one was the worst! So long mood",2
com.calea.echo,Samuel nasah,"Would easily give it a 5 star if it had the new and improved messaging standard RCS (Rich Communication Service). It's 2022, RCS is the new standard, but NO Mood won't give us that. I guess I'll be sticking to Google messages and I advise y'all to do same. For Samsung users, the messaging app they offer is just fine as well.",1
com.calea.echo,Tracy Caine,"I really like this messaging app, it is easy to customize and has all options that i need. I would like to see more themes being produced though, i have had this for over a year now and there hasn't been any new themes put on. Also having the option of downloading the latest emoji's, it says ""coming soon"" but when is soon. If these were sorted and continuously updatedmi would give the app a 5 * but can only give it 4* as it seems to be lagging behind alot of other messaging apps with updates.",4

At last some other people had a response from the developer. I'm going to start looking for another app. Recent updates screwed up my Galaxy. I've used this app for years now. Totally disappointed. Tried reinstalling it 4 times and then finally figured out it was messing up my outgoing calls too. Oh well, it was good while it lasted.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,good app works as it should. only problem for me is the spacing on the chat list is cramped and its hard to see what message is from who. I added a line between messages but they need to separate the list better. and it may be because I use a bigger font. lots of fun settings.,4
com.calea.echo,Scarlet Wohhow,"I never write reviews but I feel it needed to be done. I've used this app for the longest time and I genuinely love all the customization you can do. Sadly now messages don't come through unless you're actually on the app. Support hasn't answered any emails of mine in the recent past, and the FAQ link in the assistance tab doesn't work anymore, saying the company no longer uses that website. From past reviews I've seen it doesn't look like they're fixing notifications any time soon. :((",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,i love this app - there are NO ADS EVER! You can customize the appearance of everything and there's LOTS of choices for each thing you can customize.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be my favorite texting app, until ads started popping up. I understand the need for revenue, but $20 to dismiss ads for a lifetime (or even $10 when at half off) is completely unreasonable when I have plenty of free/cheaper options.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Wow.  At a glance, the app looks great. I would even go as far as saying it's better than Textra. However, just like Textra and a majority of other SMS apps, Mood Messenger lacks an adequate blacklisting feature. Look, I get spam SMS messages left and right and blocking a single number doesn't help when they spoof all their numbers. You know what would help? The ability to blacklist the word ""Moe"" and ""Muhammad"" because all their messages refer to me as that. Idk how so many apps justify having such awful blacklisting features.",2

Also for some reason I'm having problems getting new fonts downloaded every time I try it says that the website is unauthorized,4

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"A gorgeous texting app that is very customizable and I love Raleway as a font so I was thrilled to find it as the default. Anecdote aside, I love that this app can recreate the Messenger ""chat heads"" feature without having to use sms on Messenger. I've spent a good deal of time tweaking settings and feel like there is likely much more left to play with. I'd recommend anyone give it a try but particularly suggest it to people who want lots of control over how their sms client functions.",4

Give it 15 minutes while Im messaging a co worker ..then it dismisses whatever im dojng and goes to the message I tried to access earlier...plus, it won't update or send me my messages, phone calls, out going calls not to mention somehow disabled other apps such as letting me know I have missed telephkne calls.

I don't need a notification icon, a badge icon, AND a pop up. For an app that's so customizable, it's ridiculous they left out an option for this. If you don't want a constant pop up every time you get a message, you're not gonna like this app. I've seen people post online asking the developers for a solution but no answers were given. I can only assume there is no option to turn it off. I'll be looking for a new app and uninstalling this one.",2

Can't seem to turn it off. Emojis no longer populate in predictive text within app. Still get text dumps. 2/7/2020: Installed several updates & still text dumps & no stickers or gifs. 1/2020: sending never completes, can't use gifs or stickers, and receive dumps of missed texts at points in the day.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Been using it for a few years. I thought updates were fine until recently. My phone only notifies me about messages when I unlock my screen. of my screen isn't unlocked then I have no notifications!

I need for this to be fixed asap so unfortunately my writing of this review means I'll be using another messaging service from now on.,1

Use a different app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I LOVED Mood. It was by far my favorite texting app. But then it stopped vibrating when I got texts, and the tech team was unresponsive when I pointed it out. I had to switch apps because of this. I wish they would fix this so that I can go back to Mood.",1

Why do I need to have the annoying icon during each call which means its in the way throughout the call. Worse is the stupid screen that comes up after the call, interrupting my workflow. When you try to disable caller ID and silence the notifications it just stops notifications all together. I wont come back till its gone! not even 1‚≠ê.",1

I have a Samsung Note 9.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Works well but often won't let messages through unless I open the app. I often get a long string of messages coming in at the same time not because they all actually were sent at the same time, but because Mood doesn't know they are there until I open it. Quite annoying.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,It says it has typing indicators to let you know when the contact is replying but it doesn't. That's my only downfall. Tech support takes forever to reply. And also you can't change the font on the main screen. That bugs me as well.,4

The app will get 5 stars if they can help with the removal of this useless icon. There are 2 icons: Emoji & Emogi - They are taking up unnecessary space. I would like to remove the extra icon on the right side of the message bar while in the chat window. Messaging space is limited when texting which causes me to constantly click on it by accident. How do I go about removing the 'Emogi' icon only?,4
com.calea.echo,Paradox,"I love this app. Ever since I got my android galaxy s9, I downloaded it the day I got it because I hated the default it came with. Unfortunately I have to give it 3 stars, because for the past few months it hasn't been notifying me when I get a text. I think no one has been texting me and then get a call from my mom asking why I'm not responding, and when an app's only function is to provide quick and clear communication, that is a bad flaw to have.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,Good It gives you great auctions for customization from changing the color of the LED when a certain person send you a message to individual text message sound notifications. It has recently dropped off a good bit in that when there is an update out there the app won't let you use it at all until it updates even if you're not connected to Wi-Fi. It also has started delaying sending messages sometimes by after 45 minutes and can receive messages but doesnt notify until phone is unlocked,3

com.calea.echo,A Google user,I changed from the standard android messenger app to mood because mood had an option to send a mass text to individual recipients where as android messenger did not and I grew to really like the app. The recent updates have been awful though. I'm not sure why the mood development team decided to add a caller ID to its app when every single mobile phone has its own native caller ID. The mood ID is completely nonfunctional and you can't turn it off. Mood also does not work on my Samsung frontier 3,2

I had ordered the premium services and canceled right after I order it since I didn't want to connect to Facebook. They said I didn't need a facebook account but I needed to connect anyways. I requested a refund from them on September 21st and just heard back from them today October 3rd. The reason for not giving me a refund is number 1 it didn't have anything to do with premium services and number 2 that the refund time had passed. First off it doesn't matter if it had anything to do is premium Services, it was within the time frame for a refund and second off what terrible support from mood.",1

LIKE WHY DO I HAVE TO CLICK 3 DIFFERENT BUTTONS JUST TO COPY AND PASTE. WHY DO I HAVE TO MANUALLY SELECT TO USE MMS FOR EVERY GROUP CHAT WHY ARE THERE TWO NOTIFICATION BARS FOR EVERY MESSAGE!? I understand that stuff can be changed using options but it is hard understanding which freaking option to change when THERE ARE 12 (TWELVE!!!!!!!!!!!!) SUBMENUS INTHE SETTINGS. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND THE RELEVANT OPTION WITH THAT!? It's like the designers picked one tiny focus group and then decided that everyone must be like them. It is intensely frustrating because Mood's interpretation of UX seems to be aimed at some weird ass subgroup of people that I can't wrap my head around.,4
com.calea.echo,Theee Chosen One,"In Group I get DUAL messages of the messages I send out. The new ad banner up top is annoying. This used to be the BEST SMS app on Google and has gone south big time. In this day and age when you have other apps offering tons of features, FREE, no ads, there's no need to stick to this one any more (until these guys up their game)",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It feels a little bloated unless you trim it down to barebones, but the customization options even for free users are great. If you spend a lot of time in your texts, Mood will help you make them comfortable.",5
com.calea.echo,Mariah Day,I loved this app but then the update came and I cannot stand the aftercall pop up. It cancels out of anything else you are doing and is difficult to get rid of. I am moving on to a different app. I dont need my texting app to manage my calls I just need it to text.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I downloaded about 15 or so different sms apps before finding Mood, and I could never go back. I needed an app that would allow me to group message for my graduate program for university and this does what I need flawlessly. No invasive ads or hidden gimmicks. Amazing customization and very cute themes.",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,That's bs cause I tried another message app and its sends MMS with wi fi. Again I want my 10.99 back or at least half. Your app doesnt send pics or videos using wi fi and takes forever with data. not good using data when your limited. Maybe another update is needed but right now it sucks. Hello I will file a complaint about you not replying to all my messages sent to support.,1
com.calea.echo,ultra ultra,Peeety sleek looking app. Thw ads are not overly intrusive amd fit well. My only issue so far and ita a big one ia the blacklist feature. I am overrun by spam texts. Although you can add a number to the blacklist I nees ro add a keyword or phrase!! If I get thia abitu easily a 5 star app. Until then it's still only 3.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Recently got Note 9 and unfortunately it doesn't allow customization of the text messaging. So I found out about this app and I really love the fact that I can customize my text. It's also ad free (well I haven't come across any ads),5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Repetitive... That's what happens to all of my texts lately. I will hit send, and then my recipient will get it 2x or 3x, or sometimes it will say ""Failed to Send"" but they did get it. I paid for the full version, seeing I loved this ap so much, but now I can't even use it. HELP!!!",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I really enjoy the app.. and it was doing good but now it's been crashing, sending messages very late and when I try and delete messages it will crash or delete them and put them back in my list. can u please fix these issue I dont want to find another app to use. thx",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be a great app but now GIFs don't work, the new ad bar is incredibly disrupting to the experience becauss it covers texts (forcing you to click on it after your convos load), and NOW IT UNKNOWINGLY SENDING ADVERTISEMENTS to EVERYONE in my messages to download Mood Messenger without my knowledge or permission. Pretty terrible and unethical. I'm shocked. Instant uninstall.",1
com.calea.echo,R. Abram,"My issue was fixed as of yesterday, July 29th. whereas my text messages were coming into my group chat. I was receiving individual text messages instead of the messages going into the group chat that I have. Today July 30th, 2021 there was an update and now the messages arent going into the group text again. They're coming in as individual text replies. I have the latest version of Mood, and my phone is a Galaxy Note 10+.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,this is probably one of the best messaging apps I've ever used. there are many additional things to it that I love. it works wonderful and there are barely any ads. I'll admit the new caller id update was a bit annoying but I just disabled it. this app is wonderful and works great!!,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Mood was great, used it for a couple years. But now that it's overriding ""do not disturb"" in getting rid of it. I use do not disturb to mute texts while I'm trying to sleep because I DON'T WANT TO BE DISTURBED. uninstalled.",1

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"For the most part, I enjoy the app. However, I purchased the lifetime option. A few days later, the app showed that I had not made that purchase although I had a receipt.

com.calea.echo,Michael Paley,I've been using Mood for years and always loved the customizations but after switching phones recently and perhaps after a recent update to Mood I realized that I can't receive MMS messages. I can receive them with Samsung Messages if I enable that as default. Tried another 3rd party app and it also receives MMS without issues. Sorry to have give this up.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"good app, but not easy to make multiple contact send list (or else I can't figure it out.) After last update, says can't send pictures anymore because files are too large. I sent by email to tech support but no answer. Downgrading my review to 1 star.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Downloaded this morning. So far I love that there are a lot of options to customize the way you prefer it to sound and look. Don't think that I've ever had a message app that offered so many different options and I absolutely love that part as of right now. I will rate again in a week.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Excellent app with lots of customization options. After a year, I just discovered themes and they are nice. I wish it had a desktop companion app. I just upgraded to Premium to support the developer of this fine app!",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Good App. Getting annoying ads now since last week. Not all of the time but enough to irritate me and want to go back to my native app or try a other application. UPDATE: I factory reset my phone and installed Mood and no ads so I jumped the gun on this review. Great App.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"[UPDATE: Ads being introduced, or outlandish fee for pro version...GOODBYE was nice while it lasted] Switched to Mood several months ago because I was getting annoyed with little glitches that started popping up in my long-time preferred sms app (VrznMssgs). I cannot think of one thing I don't like about Mood. Does everything very well, enough customization to keep me happy...very satisfied! New Caller ID version just updated, can't wait to see how it works :>}",2
com.calea.echo,Eric Rice,I am pleasantly surprised that this app is working great again. After paying for Premium Service on this app an update completely ruined the experience. I could send or receive texts and that's why you download an app like this to text and receive texts. I uninstalled it and promised never to use it again. That was a few years ago and I decided to give the app another try. I couldn't be happier. It's back to being a great messenger app.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I can't seem to get any assistance from Mood regarding delayed text messages.  Some messages are delayed utp to five hours!  This is not a connectivity issue as this is happening at home when I am connected to Wifi.  I uninstalled and went back to google messages and no longer experience delays.  I would like a refund of my lifetime subscription.,2
com.calea.echo,N Black,"This was my main mms/sms app. Never had any problems. Liked the look and customization options. However, June 30 2020 update has broken it. My phone constantly restarts and spazzes out any time i get a msg. Don't know what you did, but undo it, please.",2

com.calea.echo,A Google user,i love the app. my favorite text app i've ever used. my only issue is i have problems sending pictures quite often. it just sends blanks. when the default text app on my phone has no issue sending the same pics. if that gets fixed then i'd give it 5 stars for sure,4
com.calea.echo,Rachel Burk,"I love it, or I did. I recently upgrade my phone to the galaxy note 10+ 5G and the app has went down hill for me. The notification tone I chose, gets defaulted, things keep closing automatically, it freezes... Maybe I will try again in the future.",2

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It freezes so bad.i love the concept but its so many bugs. I have to always restart the app just to open up a text.

Bummer they were the best part.,3

com.calea.echo,Dani Andersen,"I love to customize all things so this is great for that! I do have a default messaging app I use that came with this phone so when I set this as my default instead of the other one, often times when I reset my phone or it freezes up I have to check that this is marked as default other wise I can't use it. Minor glitch but otherwise a great, personable, fun app.",4
com.calea.echo,Christina D (italiansoxgirl25),Not great since last update. Incoming Group messages are sent seperately now. So if 4 people in a group I have 4 seperate text messages. Can't even keep track. Was a fantastic app but may uninstall and go to standard wireless carrier.,3

I try reset app, change batt. managment settings, but helps only return to default sms app. I think problem is with mood vs. android 9 pie.",4

com.calea.echo,A Google user,They offer 'Gif Burst'!!! Is there a way to stop the app from putting two notifications on my screen when I receive a message? I only want the head notifications. I've clicked on everything through notifications. Sometimes only the head icon pops up and other times there are 2 notifications.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Like others have said, the new ad banner is terrible. Ruins the nice theme you set & makes everything laggy. For several months, my messages don't come in until hours later & usually only do so if I turn my phone screen on. Now with the recent update my messages don't send at all. Every text I tried to send yesterday has completely disappeared & the people I sent them to never got them. My kids keep sending me screenshots to prove it.

com.calea.echo,Lynn Lesniewski,I to came from Textra and like that everyone had their own color that would be an awesome option. Plus I don't see when others are responding/typing. And one more thing would be awesome if you could react to a message like on apple phones.,4

com.calea.echo,Jerry Chavez,Don't download gives unwanted ad push notifications for taboola no way to disable causes notification tones to glitch and constantly go off till phone is reset. Last updated ruined perfectly good app I don't mind some ads but forced push notifications that can't be disabled is just malware in disguise will be looking for new messaging app,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I love this app! I needed to install it after Samsung took away all of my notification customization options in my contacts. There was a brief snafu with one of the updates messing up this app but they're techa fixed it amazingly fast! I could not be more happy with this app!,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Use to really like this app and had it as default. Recently I got a new phone and reinstalled it but havnt set it as default yet. Any time I close my phone app or messages app mood immediately opens asking to set as default and asking for location services permission. I get why but for this app to just bombard my phone with permission request after every call or message is ridiculous and is the reason im uninstalling.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It's almost everything i want in a texting app. Almost. I wish you could give users the option of using a nickname for a conversation instead of just the person's name. Otherwise, an excellent app.",5

com.calea.echo,A Google user,In love with the app and the new update. ive been using it for years anytime i get an andriod phone. i like to personalize my messages so having so many choices and tweeks is great for me. everyone i talk to can have a different layout for their messages. id love popup messages or chat heads for convience,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Company appears to be out of business. No one responds to any communication. Please do not download this application or pay any money to them. I tried to get a refund but was denied. This mornings update completely broke the client. It does not work at all! I emailed support and as a paying customer hoped I would get a response. Nothing at all. Time to find a better application. I would stay away from this one and certainly don't bother with paying for it.,1

com.calea.echo,A Google user,Premium/Lifetime user: Can't contact help via the assistant within the app. I can't live with the Emogi Highlights option in compose box and you can't turn it off...if this is a long term item I'll need find a alternative sms application.,1
com.calea.echo,Kidus K,"It works well sometimes but there's this thing that it does,when I send a text it'll send it 2 times and when I receive a message I don't get notifications so when important texts are sent I don't see them that needs to be fixed so I'm just giving it 3 stars",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like it but I hate trying to select photos in the message thread. The little green button is really annoying. Majority of the time you don't click the button, you just end up clicking the photo under it over and over",4
com.calea.echo,Fulvor,"Used Mood for almost 2 years. Used to really like mood, but they've added ads everywhere, and are now adding an extra window when I make calls... Just to place an ad. Disappointed uninstall.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"The reason why I uninstalled mood is same with majority of users - inability to send sms. It happens at random times. The only fix is to remove mood then restart phone. Hope this will be fixed by the devs as this is the most ""show stopper"" error. I also hope the devs would respond. Previous owner of mood messenger is very quick to reply and caters our requests.",2
com.calea.echo,shortyred60,Still buggy hate the ads banner! Slowed down my scroll on my phone. Way to bloated now. Shame before update was a good app! 6/20/20 This app is so much garbage! It used to be good but adds and not working right have made me uninstall. They don't listen and fix it so bye to you! This is a shame because this would be thee best message app period IF! They would fix it!,2
com.calea.echo,Fisaha Nguse,Its almost nice. I love it i use it properly and works properly but it takes to much time since a message is sent and delivered but not show the message on the reciver's phones. Just i gave it 4 star thats will also fixed as soon as possible its my hope.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I was using Textra for years then tried this. Was ok for the first day and bought the lifetime pass. Unfortunately SMS messages now either don't come at all or they are delayed. Was trying to setup Line which required a msg to be sent after hitting resend multiple times and waiting 5+ mins no notification came through. I set Textra back to default and hit resend instantly got msg. Returned to Mood, 15mins later the 12 Msgs all arrived at once. Would like a refund. Caller ID is obnoxious.",1

com.calea.echo,A Google user,this app use to be awesome now it messes up video files and makes it so when your sending them the other person cant watch them cause there so blurry alot of the features that mood once had are not available anymore such as the mood friends very disappointed in the app I was using it past 3 years now I have to find something better that actually works,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've been using this app for awhile and I used to love it, but as if the latest update I have lost the sound notifications. They all come in vibrate. please fix this issue as I need to have sound and I really loved this app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Love Love Love this app. During the last update I had some issues so I switched to Pulse for about a week...I came right back to Mood. The features offered are amazing...especially the secret mode (which was my purpose for initially downloading mood). Ah-may-zing!,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I want to love it but the multimedia messages & short texts are just taking forever to send-- consistently....IF they even send. Uninstalling. Customization ability does not trump the app doing its job.,2
com.calea.echo,Marie Loftin,"The upgrade sucks the life out of my battery during a phone call. I choose this app for text messages only, because I could set different sounds to different people. Looking for new text app",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,MMS is just not working well right now. Switched to the Google SMS & MMS app and all is well. Mood is saying that MMS messages have expired and can't download them. But they have not expired. i like the features of Mood. Just not stable.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"The app is awesome but there is a bug with this new update, it is about the background for each individual thread. When you open one thread with customized BG on it, the other thread will have the same BG also. When you restart the app, it will go back to normal until you do it again. Please fix it.",3
com.calea.echo,Morgan W,"App is buggy and is not currently working Add gradient color option to bubble colors, let us assign colors to specific contacts in group messages, fix GIF finders, update live emoji to newest emoji and this app would be perfect.

com.calea.echo,justme33126,"I am joining the crowd of people who used to love this app but don't anymore. I don't like the latest update at all. Font size can't be customised anymore. More ads and a few new glitches. I'd be really peeved if I'd paid! And you should reply to all, not just those who write a positive review. Some PAYING users are unhappy but they seem to be ignored. Not a good sign.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Used to be really good but now it's constantly asking to turn off my WiFi for no apparent reason. Has done it about 8 times in the last two minutes and I'm about ready to uninstall it. Definitely disappointing.,2

Doesn't connect to my gallery anymore.. doesn't send emails if I add pics from another folder.. I get these intrusive call pop-ups out of nowhere.. just sad as no other program was better but had to Uninstall it... Fix it!!",5
com.calea.echo,DO-CTOR,If you could have the ability to save your current customization settings into a theme you can switch back to easier that'd be really handy. Perhaps you could have three slots for them.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,i WAS a premium paid subscriber to this app and it didnt work as described for encrypted messages and i sent a few emails that went unanswered for the most part. i think one was replied to but not the problem. But i still loved the app UNTIL THIS RECENT update with caller id bullsh** was maditory for my phone to work. i deleted this app and im searching for a app worth using now.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,wish the quick reply would allow you to respond from the home screen instead of having to swipe down. plus mine doesn't show automatically. i hear the notification but it doesn't show a preview which i don't like.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This has been my go to app for about 2 years now, but the most recent update with full screen ads and automatic opening after a phone call has ruined it. I hate to do it, but I'm uninstalling it.",2
com.calea.echo,Sarah B. Martin,I have been using Mood since last year and I loved it until it stopped sending and receiving my MMS messages. I also keep getting ads even though I paid for no ads. I'm highly disappointed because I love this app but I can no longer use it.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,No customer service!!!! Please help me!!! I've sent 4 emails and no response yet my font won't change my stickers are gone and my floating notifications are also gone I paid for premium and now all the features I loved are gone if not helped soon I'll have to find new app.. I really don't want to change and I pray someone will contact me back this has me so upset been wasting time trying to get my features back! Please fix asap! Please respond to me at the very least :(,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Was neat. Now ad central. They released an update that now forces ads into evety phone call you make or receive once it is completed. It did not used to be this way. Eh. Time for a new messaging app that is actually ad free.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Simply the best when it comes to SMS. I have fallen in love with this app because of its features. In comparison with other similar apps, I put Mood message first before any other. One I like to suggest is if quick reply under signature is enhanced farther with instant and manual options, this will make it a must have app for android users",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"The app is terrible!!!!I was loving the app. I had it for 3+ years, but I'm having so many issues since the last update. Theres too many gliches. I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times. I'm over it!!!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Been using this app as my default for a while now, even paid for the premium account. I haven't had any issues on my current device or the previous with the app. Only thing I would like is to be able to keep my Samsung default Emojis..",5
com.calea.echo,Nicole Henley,This last update is horrible! My emojis won't show. I tried to disable the calling ID since I already have it on my phone but I can't and it's annoying. The app is super delayed when send texts or sms. Please fix this!,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I really liked this app at first, but i havent been able to send a regular MMS in quite a while. Plus, I'm kinda disappointed that there have been few if any new themes - free or otherwise - since I paid for premium last year.",3
com.calea.echo,J J,New update is more annoying than helpful as well as some bugs. The after call report they push is just another way to put up more ads. I do not want a report after the call because I already know who I was talking to. Why do developers want to push ads down users throats? All it does is make the app worse and get your users angry enough to change apps. Guess I'll look for other messenger apps.,1
com.calea.echo,Mac Miller,"I remember at some point I was using this and it was phenomenal but had deleted a while ago. I'm not a huge fan of trying to check messages ""manually"" when really I'd perfer for my phone to tell me. Enabling the flash notifications so you'll be able be notified way easier. My reason for why mood messenger hasn't been set as my main because most of the time I was around people and the light would pop off causing attention.. but I think this will be my main for sure now.",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Been a long time user of this app. Last year I bought the lifetime premium so I wouldn't have adds.

com.calea.echo,austin bernal,App was great but then it went to hell text messages wouldn't be received as normal they would only show up once I opened my phone and it would show recieved 15 to 20 min late.

com.calea.echo,Victor Ruzicka,"My mood messenger app has burned through 273 MB of data in a little over a day! I've sent 87 messages, one was a 15-second voice clip. On average, that's almost three megabytes per message, and it should be only kilobytes. Did one of the new updates start mining my data and sending it without my permission over the network?",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,App was great. But sending pictures takes forever or not at all. Latest update are becoming unstable. Hope they fix soon or may have to move apps. Anyone know how to roll back the app,2

But it updated today & now THERE'S ADS!? & TO GO PREMIUM IS ELEVEN FRICKIN DOLLARS A YEAR! Are you frickin kidding me? That's expensive for a dern app! Or $20 for life... I can understand $1 month or $5 for life, but these prices are just ludacris imo. Now I'm forced to go back to my default messenger. Maybe consider lowering the prices, I don't see many people willing to pay them.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Now has add on the contact and thread screen. Owned by Facebook but doesn't have enough money to develop simple features.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,Best text app I've used so far. Very customizable. Only dissapointment was only 3 premium themes. Lots of themes however so it's still sweet but would like more options for the premium upgrade but still happy to support such an awesome messaging app regardless.,5

So bye bye to Mood.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Used this app for years but ever since this update yesterday I haven't been able to receive or send messages.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"1/2/2020 - I'm unable to customize my notification sounds on my Pixel 2 xl and no RCS support One feature that I would love to see added is the option to reply to a specific message within a text thread.

Would love to have it as it allows for better conversation flow within a text thread.",2
com.calea.echo,Robert Keng,Used to think it was ok even put up with it not being able to send some messages right away but the stupid ad pop-ups after a call pretty much did it for me. I dont mind banner ads but this was just too intrusive. Installed chomp and moved on.,1

Looking at the FAQ for Account Kit, Facebook receives information about the device along with phone number.   Even if it doesn't require you have to Facebook this is a form of Fingerprinting that can be used.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"First the floating notifications disappeared (one of the main reasons i got it). Then friends started emailing ""why aren't you replying to my texts?.

com.calea.echo,Yuki (KitsuneLover),Please fix the double pop up of the app when receiving phone calls and if u can't remove the forced permissions access to the phone that this app asks for because not everyone wants it to be your personal assistant.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,excellent for several reasons (at least in comparison to the base apps that came with my phone) customization and the ability to view youtube videos within the app. Only thing I would want extra is integration with bitmoji,5

com.calea.echo,Kateri Lowenstein,Needs an easier way of opting out of certain notifications (like specific individual) and spamcall filtering technology is out of date. I should probably try out some new apps now that I'm thinking about it.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Love the app! Only issue I have is the popup notifications that interrupt the screen when I play games or reading an ebook. I cant seem to find a way to turn it off.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,This was my FAVORITE sms apo. i recommended to so many people that now use it . however i deleted the app. After the update we SHOULD NOT be forced to let this app take over our phone calls. and we cant use the app without the permission. just stick to sms and not try to get involved in our whole phone. im sure you will lose a lot of download because of this . it should be an option NOT MANDATORY.,1

com.calea.echo,A Google user,Love this app and all features no ads which is awesome or i would delete. Only thing ibdo not like is the Premium is over priced compared to all other good texting programs out there. FREE VERSION IS GREAT i recommend everyone at least give it a try,5

com.calea.echo,James Nuttall,Very slow and buggy. I even paid for the full version without ads to see if that helped. It did not. Almost unusable in its current state. Had to uninstall it. Would not recommend.,1
com.calea.echo,Randy Purnell,Mood does everything I need it to do without getting any weird error messages like Messaging always did. It's quick and you can customize it to fit your needs.,5
com.calea.echo,Kodi Martin,Would have gave a 5 rating but lately when i open up the app to send pic messages it shows all my pics blank. Makes no sense at all..... FIXED ISSUE WITH CAMERA AND PICTURE GALLERY!!! 5 STAR RATING!!! THANK YOU FOR FIXING IT,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Was great, now down the hill! Had this for many years, even paid for pro because it was so good. Now, got ads at the top, texts and delayed. Fix it, currently uninstalled and back to stock.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Almost perfect, please have it to where the app turns on our data automatically when receiving mms! I can only receive mms if my data is on all the time and sometimes I end up maxing out on my data plan. Please update this and it'll be a 5/5 for me!",4
com.calea.echo,Tanel Martinez,I love using this app for messaging for its highly customizable and themes feautures. My only suggestion is that I could customize the central messaging page in order to view slide show pics on the top.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I like this app but wish it had a more stock looking feel to it. Its a bit pastel coloured which is not too my liking. However it more than makes up for this with the customisation and lo and behold proper date and timestamps!,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"this app was good untill the last update now I don't get any notifications at all, I miss important messages, if this could be fixed asap then if give more stars, at the moment I'm not happy, I have done what Mad Seven suggested unfortunately it didn't work so I have deleted the app",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This is actually a great app! Easy to customize, never crashes and a good amount of themes. Just wish you could customize your keyboard.",5
com.calea.echo,Cody Williams,Great app with great customization options. Would be 5 stars if my MMS didn't fail to send 90% of the time. Changed from 3 to 2 stars because my MMS still will not send consistently.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"love this app! only issue i have is that for whatever reason it wont sound or vibrate my samsung watch with a new message but will pop-up on the screen. if that worked, it would get a 5 star. After your update, this works flawlessly now. Thank you for the quick fix! Changed to 5 stars üëç",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"i downloaded this app becsuse my default app was sending texts ten min to a day later than i originally sent them and i was getting MULTIPLE repeats from other ppl days after i had already read, responded and deleted them. It was so frustrating!! This app is GREAT!! THANKS",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,So good that it caught me by surprise. No ads. AMAZING themes to choose from. Even a feature that helps you prevent sending that regretful text when you're drunk.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Love the ability to fully customize. I've had no problems with lost messages or calls. Also, has the ability to let you know if message has been read, that's my favorite!",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I have used this app for a couple of years I loved it until last update,everything changed cant use custom tones unless app is open also everything goes back to default when app is closed. Still deserves 4 stars would love to give 5 if bugs were fixed. Still best msg app out. Update: thank you! it worked! 5 stars love this app",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Cannot connect to mood with phone number or my Gmail account. It says cannot connect to the server. And sms is not available at this time. Please try again or reinstall the app. Well I've reinstall the app and tried again and still nothing. I do not expect you to answer because you have not answered any time I've done this before. Good day,1
com.calea.echo,Angela Woods,"I loved mood. Loved it. I was fine with the ad bar at the top. But then, there started to ad notifications showing up in my notifications.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Messages are delayed way too long. I decided to test this by installing another messaging app and Mood lost on every test. Plus the add banner on top is really annoying. Pulse is better.,1
com.calea.echo,Daryl McIntosh,"The last two updates were junk...now floating notifications won't go away, the night mode text doesn't work, and the chat list lines are gone. Who know what else is broken.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I've been using this app for how many years. But when I changed my phone. I didn't work properly. To registering my phone number and the head notif. My phone is android 8.0 now. Is this really happened on higher specs phone? Please fix this. I really love this app. Thank you!,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,This app is the bomb üëå.! Ive had it for a couple months and it is so much better than the stock Android app that came on my phone.Ive had zero problems. Messages blocking calls everything workss great. I highly recommend and i never recommend anything...,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I used to love this messaging app but recently I'm finding that my texts are delayed. Sometimes I won't receive texts until the day after they were sent! Please fix this right away or I'll have to delete the app.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I delete messages but every time I open the app those deleted messages pop right bacc up.! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëéüèæüò° Takes forever for app to open.. App moves super slow.. I get notifications telling me I have a new message but there's no new messages comin' through.. üò°üëéüèæ,1
com.calea.echo,Lindsey R,I don't get text messages unless I open the app and then all of my texts will flood in and then my outgoing texts will send 5 times in a row. This app used to be great but now it's nothing but problems.,2
com.calea.echo,Sheng Bigayan,My incoming messages won't show which carrier it was sent to if it was sent to card 1 or card 2. What happened? Pls fix this. I really love your app. This is the only messaing app I trust. Pls fix the issue. I am having a hard time knowing which sim card the message was sent to.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Love the ability to personalize it and with Android taking away the ability to set individual alert tones now, this app does allow you to do that overriding Android. Its fantastic.",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I enjoy this texting app much better than the default one suggested by Verizon. It allows me to set up a more personalized salutation that is automatically applied to all of my text messages.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be Better than the Google messenger. Lots and lots of options... but since the update, there is an irritating bright ad bar and the pictures only once you've exited... Very VERY disappointed.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"So it's not just my phone. When I get a message, there is no sound. It's even getting stuck at sending messages. I've tried everything. I love mood messenger and I don't want to uninstall it. Please fix. Thank you. Update: I reviewed in English, why respond in another language? I don't speak or read French. Sorry.",3
com.calea.echo,Nelson Santiago,One of the only apps I found so far that you can put a background picture for every persons text exchange if you wanted to. Nice to be texting my daughter while simultaneously looking at her baby picture :),4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,app was fantastic until they decided to forecfully enable caller id (that doesn't work) after an update. i spent weeks wondering why i was getting this stange popup until i finally tracked it down to this app. im a paid customer and not happy about this. it also causes calls coming to slow down the phone to a crawl and i have missed calls. yes i have disabled the caller id feature but you should not force it on users ..,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This app was amazing until I did the update. Now I'm not getting messages, some aren't sending, and there's ads at the top. Why is it not working??? My friends are having the same problem",2
com.calea.echo,Ron Swift,"By far, the best texting app of the best used. However, premium users are being stuck with pop-up ads. A quick solution to this shouldn't take weeks.",5
com.calea.echo,Tina Swain,"EDIT: I bought the Lifetime Membership and have used Mood for years. The last 3 updates have destoyed this app. I'm SO tired of great apps being turned into awful unusable junk. I'm SO tired of app users being outright IGNORED when we are literally PLEADING with you to put it back the way it was. DO WE NOT MATTER TO YOU ANYMORE? If not, then please consider handing this app over to someone who will respect it and its users.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"In concept everything is great, however execution isn't the best. Nothing against the dev, but every update would constantly break something. I grew tired of it. If you are a galaxy user like I am, it's a struggle to get this app to work properly.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Love how you can edit the text bubbles etc, I have different ones for different people and for me it personalises my messaging and like it says on the tin ""mood"". Great app, I love it",5
com.calea.echo,michael landerfield,"Updated review since dev response: APP IS TRASH, DO NOT INSTALL! Obviously the developers dont read reviews because I stated all permissions were allowed, notifications were on, etc yet their fix was to do what I have already done. Again, do not download or use, better texting apps available, mood was once highly rated but now only 3.4 rating, it's gone to shlt.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"After the latest update, there are ads that take up 1/3 of the screen. There was no ads before. I am not blaming the developpers for trying to make money of course, but I have to say goodbye. It was great while it lasted.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This application is actually really good. But now it wants access to calls. I use the default phone application, but now Mood shows an ad after every call. I really wanted to like this application.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I want to give 5 stars...I loved this app up until recently. When the caller id option was added my chat heads stopped working. I have uninstalled it multiple times rest all data and nothing works. It's really frustrating because I can't get a answer on how to fix this issue. Grrrrrrrr i tried turning off caller id option and chat heads and quick reply still does not work. üò©,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I really love this app. I even want to pay premium however I hate the lag when you open it. I wish the app could be faster. Now I'm trying to look for other apps with the same features as this without the lag. I'm not a fan of the caller ID,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used to love mood and I hate lowering my review, but the app definitely has a fatal flaw: I don't always get my texts. If I haven't texted with someone in a week or more, I don't get their messages until I restart my phone. A friend of mine texted me when her mother passed away and I didn't restart my phone for 2 days and I wasn't there for her when I should have been. I'm heart broken.",1
com.calea.echo,Jeff Rash,"I used to love the app, but the recent update that forces a new informational screen with too much garbage that you can't turn off of annoying. I'll be using it for a few more days while I look for a replacement.",1

com.calea.echo,A Google user,Mood messenger is a very unique messaging app for phones. It is very fast when it comes to sending sms or receiving as well. I so much love the customization of this app. Interface is clean. Must installed app on every phone.,5
com.calea.echo,Sean Burton (Flytraps),"So this app is great and have used it for a long time. However, I would have loved to hear back from support when I was having issues but they never answered any of my inquiries. Support seems to be lacking or really apathetic to user concerns.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I loved this app when I first downloaded it. I love the smooth interface, speed, and ease of use. Now I hate it. I can't receive notifications when I am on the phone, and my contacts don't ring through when my do not disturb is on. I paid for the app and it was a waste of my money.",1
com.calea.echo,EL EMM,With new update 1 out of every 5 or so texts won't send and hangs in limbo.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,For the most part the app is a great alternative to the standard messaging app but then I try to make a call and my phone freezes then shuts off. That's the main factor keeping me from rating this app a 4 or 5 star,3

Which is sad bc I e had this app since I got my phone years ago,1

com.calea.echo,A Google user,I'd love to switch back but the mms and group mms is a mess. I get the messages in the individual contacts message and then in the group chat later. Tried this on multiple carriers and devices still the same,3

com.calea.echo,A Google user,Why is the turn off wifi keeps popping up when I already didn't give it permission. Why does it want to turn off my wifi? This is annoying.,1
com.calea.echo,Z.W,"When i try pressing Next so i can give it permission, it justs sits on the screen saying ""Set Default SMS Texing Permissions in order for Mood to work!"". So i can't do anything. I am on a LG G Pad 5, so does it work or not?",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I liked about 80% of this app but I am unable to verify my phone number which is probably the reason I can't watch a YouTube video when someone sends it to me if this can get fixed I will give it five stars,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I loved this app until the last update. I no longer get notifications until I open it. So frustrated. I hate that I have to uninstall, but I shouldn't have to check my phone. It's supposed to tell me when I should look at it.",1

com.calea.echo,Dominic Cleveland,"I previously rated this app at 5 stars for its incredible custom features. Update 10.28.2020 I'm changing my review to 1 star after the new update. Its cartoonish, has childish icons, and it's an eyesore.",1

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"My problem is same with others - sometime you can send SMS, sometime not. The only solution is to uninstall mood and use other sms app. Worst of all, devs never replies to negative comments. They only reply to those who give 5 stars and those with positive comment. I miss the previous developer of mood. He listens, replies and implement our requests. All of these problems started when Mad 7 took over. Goodlw might remove your app here if you don't listen to customers.",3

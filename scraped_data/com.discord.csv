com.discord,Couch,"Overall really like the app but this new font is truly awful. It would be one thing if I just found it displeasing to look at but genuinely I and other people with reading disorders are struggling to read because all of the letters look too similar to each other and the spacing is very tight, making it perfect for messing with dyslexic and aphasic people. Thanks for that. I wish I could use OpenDyslexic on my phone and in my apps.",3
com.discord,Tiena Johnson,"I have been a user for the app since 2018 or 2017. I have loved it but there has been so many bugs. Usually when they want to change something up, they is usually some type of bug that comes with it ~ especially with audio/ video callsüòÅ. Advice: stop fixing things that are already working. Current bug: app is unable to pick up audio. It is not an issue with my headphones or devices (mobile and computer). Other applications work perfectly with audio, etc. But still happening after 2 weeks.",2
com.discord,Duckz_,"I wish we had the mobile version back on the phones. Then you changed it to the pc version. Not a fan, it doesnt look very nice on phones. For some odd reason, i will maybe download an image from.. google, for example. Then when i would like to send it to a friend/group it doesnt appear. This started recently. There is a bug(?) where it takes longer for images and videos to load, I'm not exactly sure why this is occuring. Happens with texts too. Other than these things, its a nice app.üëç",2
com.discord,Damaso Reyes,"The new update has ruined sending images. Recently, as of the last few days, there was an update to how images are selected. It has lead to massive latency when posting an image. Once selecting the palette for images there is an immediate drop in performance and closing out of the palette takes close to 20 seconds. It may be the program is trying to load all images at max resolution at once. I can't think of what else would be causing it.",2
com.discord,Kayla Gray,"Almost every single time I tap a specific notification, the app will not take me to that server and channel. Rather, it will open to the last channel I was in when I closed the app previously. What is the point of notifications then, if I can click on the one I want to go to first? Also, images never work right half the time; they appear halfway off the screen and way too large.",1
com.discord,Aureus Cordiale,"If you can use an alternate app, use it. Discord is utterly unreliable and unstable. Problems with it are varied and constant. It is quite impressive that they manage to make it worse with each update. Yet, they want you to pay for Nitro just to use animated emojis and send files more than 8MB. Hard pass. Quite possibly the worst app. I have to constantly relaunch it, or it'll just try connecting without actually doing anything. This happens often.",1
com.discord,Melein Brueck,"Everything was going great until recently. Now I'm having issues every time I try to upload an image. It lags so bad and takes several minutes to go through the process of realizing I've selected an image and uploading it, and it takes even longer if I try to type a message with it, and half the time the app just stops responding and has to close and the other half I get fed up and close out of it myself and try again when I reopen it. This happens regardless of the file size. Please fix this.",3
com.discord,DJ D00MSHYER,"The app was literally perfect before. Now its super buggy with the recent update. Whenever I want to send an image, it takes ages to load the photos, and even longer to send them, sometimes crashing the app entirely. And when it doesn't, when I scroll through the photos they end up looping, so I have to open it, which ends up being even Longer.",1
com.discord,Smol Lemon,"It's a nice app, easy to use. But with the newest update, the blue "" (number of) new messages since (time last checked)"" bar pops up at the top of the screen everytime someone types a message even if you are currently reading it, while the channels messages will randomly move the words upwards as if you scrolled up a bit when a new message is sent every so often. Edit: Now the number of people online doesn't show correctly in the server members section Edit 2: It does this on any wifi or data",3
com.discord,a random [brony],"1) All of the buttons on the UI are gone. Like the graphics for them. Such as the different tabs, the call buttons, everything. It's just the background color. It looks like it hasn't loaded. It makes it virtually impossible to use, because you'll accidentally click video call at 4:43 am 2) You can no longer send screenshots from other discord chats. It's so annoying, cause my friends don't wanna download a file just to see a pic. 3) Unless I close the app, it messes up my music after a call",2
com.discord,Paul,"Update: Fix the video freeze issue! Your Android app is suffering. Latest Update has some design flaws. In VC, when tapping user's pic, it doesn't always work even if you long-press. When the volume adjustment pops up, you can no longer drag to slide up or down. You have tap somewhere on that line to make an adjustment, which means you're not always able to turn them all the way down or up. Now when you select ""Voice Connected"" in notifications it bring you to VC chat, not list of people.",1
com.discord,Perseus Matlock,"I've been using Discord for years with no issue. These recent mobile updates have been pretty bad, though. The newest update is bugged so that whenever I open the app, it gets stuck on one channel I was in and won't show me anything else. It won't even display new messages sent in that channel. I can click on different channels and send messages on them, I just can't see what I'm replying to or what I'm even typing. It also keeps showing me an ad for Nitro EVERY time I open the app.",3
com.discord,PotatoBear,"Almost everything works great, I especially love the all black background (wouldn't mind if it got added to iOS though). The reason I gave this 3 stars is because when I try to join a VC, it just does not work at all. I can't hear or be heard. Basically the only thing that works in terms of VCs is the text chat built into the Voice Channel. I would somewhat understand if they don't work because I am on the beta program, but even after leaving the program it still had the same problems as before.",3
com.discord,Ja,"I tried to hold out and think the update would eventually improve, but that's sadly not the case. Watching videos is a hassle, as if you open it full screen, there's a coinflip on if it'll actually play. If it doesn't, you have to watch it small. The app itself feels sluggish. If many emotes are used, the app slows WAY down. And every time I open the app after long periods of not using it, it'll repeatedly open a specific DM EACH TIME. On to of that, clearing pings has also been a nightmare.",2
com.discord,oozy,"Discord, your app is absolutely horrible. You've somehow changed a good chatting app into straight up trash. Every time I call someone, I can't hear them at all no matter who it is and it's very buggy. Secondly, every time I try to chat right after opening another tab it does ""Connecting..."" and then when I try to type it won't go through. Lastly, I can't send any new images that aren't loaded. All of your 'updates' suck. Change it back to what it was before.",2
com.discord,Sophie Ehrsam,"I have to rate it one star due to the unholy amount of lag that now occurs when I attempt to send a picture. It crashes the app and it never used to do that, or it stalls the whole app and I'm not able to do anything for at least 5 minutes. It's like the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This also doesn't include the bizarre glitches that are involved when sending DMs, such as messages stacking under one user, messages not showing immediately even if the banner showed for them.",1
com.discord,JamesonDistrict,"Practically unusable anymore. I dont know what they did or thought was a good idea but it completely broke the app. Cant send videos or messages without it taking minutes, gif links get broken when you try to copy them, they made it harder to get videos/photos from your phone to send (newer ones don't show up half the time), and the app crashes everything time you get back on it - especially on a call or while watching a video. Had to reinstall it 5 separate times to get it to work again.",1
com.discord,Xephorium,"For years, discord has been one of my favorite apps. But after this year's update, it's become borderline unusable on Android. The switch to React Native was a mistake. 20% of the time, the app just crashes on launch. Long-pressing messages to emoji react has become a gambling game, sometimes working and sometimes doing nothing at all. File upload is a glitchy mess and video playback is broken, unloading or playing two versions simultaneously whenever you hit fullscreen. I miss the old app.",1
com.discord,JoJo Slammer (JoJoSlammer),"I love this app. I really do. However the lag on it is absolutely unbearable sometimes. There are times when it's a second or two delay of sending a message after clicking the send button, or text appearing in the text box a second or two after I type it. Just interaction delays in general tbh. Poor optimization, maybe?",3
com.discord,theaxolotlgod,"PLEASE stop ruining the image search. Please. Is it really that hard to leave something alone when it works just fine? Do you have to modify it every update? Really? Just let me see my images! Don't take up a third of the image search area with boxes and options I do not care about and never will. Also, it's not auto updating anymore either. Have to restart the app to get newly downloaded/creates media files to show up.",1
com.discord,Grant Gillum,"The new updates have been absolutely ridiculous. Images and videos sent by others take a longer time to load now. I can't even send images or videos as the app will freeze for fifteen seconds and crash whenever I try to hit send. Even before that, it takes nearly a minute to load whatever's stored on my phone, and another minute for anything I select to load. Even if it starts sending, it takes over a minute to send a 300kb image on good Wi-Fi, then it crashes. Discord, you've broken your app.",1
com.discord,Truitt,"Not terrible, a few issues here and there but they don't affect me too much. However an issue is an issue. Gifs and Videos don't always load and it causes me to restart the app just to see it load. Also, a small detail but gets on my nerves, everytime I put "":)"" in text, it gets converted to üôÇ. I don't like that, at all. Not to mention it removed the setting to turn off that feature from my phone. I'd like that setting back please. And fix the issues with gofs and videos please.",3
com.discord,Vidian,"There have been a ton of problems with discord recently, and it's been going downhill with each update. One of the recent issues I've ran into is one of the buttons covering the edit button for changing your banner. I've tried refreshing, reinstalling, and even restarting my phone, and lo and behold, nothing worked. I'm unsure if this is just me, but hopefully this gets fixed soon.",1
com.discord,Kem Bio,"I understand the UI transition, does resemble the PC version more overall. What I don't get is how your team managed to make this app run worse than it already did with the latest update. This new Discord version has had problems when it came to sharing media, but it's just so bad how long it takes to send a single image now with the latest update available for my device, freezing up and draining battery just trying to do so.",2
com.discord,YT_Lexi fox _,"Have been using this app for over 4 years. It's very much an all in one when it comes to screen sharing & playing with other friends. Have it be new or even old it's nice to have, especially if you don't want others to have your number. Recent down sides have been the non stop updates, having mobile notifications no longer show after each update is very annoying. Causing me to have to update at least Avery 2 weeks to a month. Not to mention sending images or video files via mobile has worsened.",3
com.discord,Haylee,"They have removed the ""nitro classic"" with basic. I bought classic for a year and it automatically got switched to basic. I have not even half the perks I paid for. Absolutely ridiculous to just switch users like this. And even more so to have this ""basic"" option. Why not keep classic AND have a basic option. Its a horrendous downgrade, and there's not a way for me to get my money back. I wish I could.",1
com.discord,nursie,"Overall, this app is really great, I would have rated it 5 stars, but, there's three problems with it. Number one, the new layout is extremely laggy. Number two, the whole having to pick from the files to upload a image is too complicated. Number three, the moderation bans people unfairly. Please fix these problems. Overall, it is good.",2
com.discord,Striker,"discord has been an amazing way to get together with friends, and has consistently stayed pretty good overall. the only issues i have with it, are that streaming on mobile consistently doesn't have audio regardless of settings and what i stream to. it's not just an issue on my end either, as my friends have also had this same thing happen to them. aside from that, it's an amazing app to use and have fun with in any regard",4
com.discord,INCOGNITO,"Its like this app gets worse with every update. Most notably as of now, the file picker doesn't work right. The hang up function is also broken and often doesn't work when I try to hang up. Then, the video in the video calls constantly freeze, ridiculously. There is more but this is just off the top of my head. Dogshit app.",1
com.discord,Mari Leigh,"this is the buggiest ive ever seen discord mobile. not only has it been difficult to manage server settings when it keeps closing, but also cameras freezing in VCs, barely being able to select a message to complete an action without it being in a very certain spot (like trying to work a broken charger so you can charge your phone), and over all having the issue of selecting things without it being in a certain spot on your screen! there's so much wrong and it seems to just be getting worse üòì",2
com.discord,Grace,"App usually works well, but this last update has made attaching photos a nightmare. The preview images in the attach UI don't update consistently anymore, and when you try to attach an image, it sometimes lags the app so badly that you have to wait 30s to be able to do anything. Then when you're finally able to start typing, it's still pretty laggy.",2
com.discord,Toy,"I used to love this app, it was a great way of talking to friends. However, recently, Idk what happened, but it's done nothing but get Worse to use. At first It was just more annoying to send pics that werent my most recent. But now? I have to fight it to send any pics at all, and i have to close and reopen the app like 3 times everytime I send a single pic. Its a nightmare. Its also just become incredibly buggy. word limit is cutting me off, but, recently, it feels like it's becoming unusable.",1
com.discord,pascal,"How is it possible for an app to get more janky the more it's updated? As long as I can remember (since 2017) the mobile app has only gotten less usable. Just recently the image selector doesn't update with new images. Also, you can no longer scroll down to view old images, after a certain point it loops the most recent ones. The entire app grinds to a halt after about a minute of use. EVERY action lags. The service is amazing, but the mobile app is horrendous, and third party is against TOS...",1
com.discord,Tpir04,"I appreciate the bugs that have been fixed and the features that have been added back to the app since the August 2022 update, such as emote names turning blue again and, most recently, the timestamps reappearing for messages more than two days old. However, I have encountered a new bug. Whenever I type two regional indicator emotes back to back, no spaces, the app auto-replaces it with a flag emote. This is incredibly inconvenient for me, and I wish it was re-evaluated and fixed!",4
com.discord,Ghost,"I've used this app for years with no issues, but for a few weeks I haven't been getting a single notification outside of the app. Everything is set up right, everything is turned on, I don't have the servers I want notifs from muted, it just stopped working one day. It's very frustrating and makes responding to things difficult, if this gets fixed I'll give the app five stars or something, idk how this works",2
com.discord,aly day,it's been a pain to use this app ever since that one update from a few months ago. it's slow and buggy and it has been for months!! i thought they were trying to fix the issues on android but yet every patch it seems to get worse. i'm just disappointed. i love this app because it's the easiest way for me to talk with all of my friends and my partner all in one place. but it's really starting to annoy me when the lag is so bad i can barely even type sometimes üò≠ i really hope it can be fixed soon,2
com.discord,Anomalocaris,"I used to think this app was one of the most well optimized messaging apps for mobile devices. However, since the UI change all that optimization and functionality is just gone. Messages often take way longer to load, just switching channels or typing can outright freeze the app. And recently ive been having issues downloading videos while in discord. When I download them the file is unplayable and impossible to post elsewhere. Really hope these issues get resolved.",1
com.discord,Ian Ethan,"Pic uploads have suddenly become extremely slow after the last update, to the point of crashing my phone. Prior, they were quick and smooth. CPU reports as being 100-percented on both clock and bandwidth during photo selection and upload, freezing over a full minute sometimes. Other times, it can go 5+ minutes without any sign of progress. You need to reoptimize your photo uploads. Thanks.",2
com.discord,Gumgetter Gaming,"This app used to be great, but ever since the recent full revamp, a lot of things have been breaking. Videos fail to load and require a restart. File upload times have increased for no reason. And, now all of the videos that I download through the app are missing their thumbnail/preview image. All of this stuff has started happening between updates, with seemingly no fixes at all.",3
com.discord,cuppy57,"This app hasn't given me trouble until the most recent update. I seem to be missing a fair amount of icons, such as the upload media button, the notification that tells me if my friends are online, or even the icon to pull up side menus (They still function). It kind of keeps getting worse, everytime I log on something else is missing.",3
com.discord,kajemi2,"This is my third revision of this review, and I unfortunately can't take it any lower than 1 star. App freezes up and lags constantly. Newly downloaded photos no longer appear to be uploaded without resetting the entire app. App drains the phone's battery and causes the phone to become quite hot. There are so many issues with this app now that did not used to be here. It has only gotten worse over the last several months. What happened?",1
com.discord,Richard Tapia,"Great app, bad mic experience. It's a great messaging app and works amazing as that. For voice calling on mobile though, it's been pretty terrible. I'm using a One Plus 6T and I have had to rely on the desktop application to talk to people. I have to yell in order for anyone to hear me speak and even then, the audio cuts out. Update: mic is still pretty bad. Nitro is cool though, collecting stickers is pretty fun",3
com.discord,archer s,"Discord has become aweful. It used to be amazing and the only way that I would message people, but now its laggy, it doesnt always give me notifications, and just looks bad. Also, if you take a picture with discord (if it lets you), it saves to your camera roll and theres no setting to turn that off. For my bf, whenever we're on the phone, it constantly lags and lags and lags, and my camera always freezes. It's not a wifi issue, it used to be just fine.",1
com.discord,Joe Cool,"For the past few weeks, every time I download a video (regardless of format) it becomes corrupt, and is completely unplayable outside of Discord itself. At first I thought it was just bad files, but I tested it by uploading a normal video and sending it to my brother, and when he downloaded it he got the same corruption bug.",2
com.discord,SharkieBae,"Honestly. I used to love this app. Used it all the time. Now it won't even let me send messages. I've tried restarting my phone. Uninstalling and reinstalling. And just, everything. It always just puts ""Can not send message. Hold for options."" All I get is the resend or delete. I've resent messages over and over and OVER again. Nothing. Please get this fixed and I'll change my review.",1
com.discord,Autumn Word,"I don't know what happened, if it's the new updates or it's just broken for me, but my call button doesn't show, along with, FaceTime, send, stickers, gift, the options along the bottom when looking at contacts. And some other features. Photos take longer to send, it glitches when trying to send photo after photo. Takes a while just to show a new photo I just took.",3
com.discord,e r i k a,"Can't play downloaded videos. When I download videos from this app, I go to my gallery, and the duration is shown as ""0:00"" and the thumbnail is blank. When I try to play the video, I get an error message. Pictures and GIFs download fine, though. Please fix this bug. It's never done this before, and it's getting frustrating.",1
com.discord,Anna Grace Gainey,"Still getting used to the new terrible and inconsistent UI. I can't just scroll to send an image, now I have to go back to my photo app and send it there. On top of that, wherever I send an image from somewhere else, all of the text on the screen just grows outrageously large and is unusable. I have to restart my phone to reset it. I can no longer see who's speaking in voice and a large box shows up on my screen when I share my screen and it won't go away. Bring back the old Discord. Pls.",3
com.discord,V/H/S,"borderline unusable at this point. I don't know what caused it but sending and loading images is completely broken. Just opening the tab to send images causes my phone to lag aggressively, sending images is unresponsive for a moment, and then the actual process of them being sent takes minutes. Sometimes videos or files that are absolutely beneath the absurd file size limit for standard users won't send for being ""too large"".",1
com.discord,James Tompsett,"So. There is a lot to go over. I'm not sure if it is my device, but at random, Discord will completely crash. Right before that, lag starts up. Not only that, if I try to open my photos through discord to, say, set a new profile picture, discord will close. I can't access all my photos through the app because it'll crash.",3
com.discord,Robert Adams,"I would honestly give this a higher rating, but the last update made a new bug. In addition to a new emote feature where emotes appear in vc by a user, it completely crashes on mobile. While my desktop friends spam it, the app completely goes out of control on my end. Keeps throwing me in and our of vc, I can't turn down the volume, and can't even bring up the home button on my screen. Just have to ride it out until I can fully shut down discord.",1
com.discord,Justin McNutt,"Great but not Perfect There are a few little things that are annoying about Discord - and I should emphasize that they are little things - but for example, if I switch from the direct message list to the list of server channels, it will automatically select the last channel I was in AND MARK IT AS READ. Overall, though, Discord is still the best chat app out there, in my opinion, which is why I bothered to write this review.",4
com.discord,Pete Ochoa,"After looking through the app and testing to see if there are anymore bugs that have hindered my experience while using the app, I can say that the updates have changed a lot. I think the app is pretty good where it's at and I hope it can keep getting better. Also I see that the issue with discord not conforming to the aspect ratio of my app window has been fixed which is great.",4
com.discord,GreenBeanWater,"Ever since they tried to copy paste the iOS version to android, it's just been a complete disaster. And every new update that comes up afterwards just breaks something else without feeling like anything has been fixed. Currently, i have to close the app completely to see pictures that i just downloaded, the display will glitch at certain times, and the keyboard will just randomly flip up after a video ends or i interact with something. Just go back to android version",1
com.discord,Gordish,"It's a great app for what it is. That being said there are some system problems such as: discord camera continuously loading at times. It's very annoying because you constantly need to refresh to get the video to show. Another highly annoying thing is that it is very difficult for me to mute someone. Imagine joining a call, hearing people talk but you can't hear what they're saying because the music bot is so loud",3
com.discord,Dark Disasters,"I refrained from saying anything cause there were already so many telling you that your mobile app, since the major update in summer, has been absolute garbage, but I'm getting to a point where it is just a struggle to even use anymore. I have experienced at LEAST 1 hard crash each day if I'm lucky, it is extremely laggy every few 15-30 minutes, I can only post 1 image at a time, gifs take a while to send/load, I constantly disconnect from voice chats. All this after that huge update in summer.",1
com.discord,treydog1357,"Like many other reviews have pointed out, this app is absolutely awful lately. I can't understand what caused such a horrible optimization that would go unfixed for months. It's slow to change channels and dms or to do anything really. It automatically opens profiles or videos upon opening the app which is incredibly annoying. Trying to send a photo is unbearable, and has even gotten worse since yesterday, being extremely slow and even freezing. I would say more if the character limit was bigger",1
com.discord,Alyx Aizawa,This app is wonderful and easy to use. I've meet some of my best friends here in discord. Update: as of late discord has been absolutely horrendous to use. Every time I press the plus button to share photos my discord crashes or lags horrendously. The only way to fix this is by force closing the app and to not click that button every again. As someone who sends a lot of photos to my friends its quite frustrating. Plus sharing photos from outside the app will make the text infinitely smaller so.,1
com.discord,FritterMouse,"After the barrage of updates, the app consistently crashes, i can no longer share audio when i stream my screen on mobile, the UI Is obnoxious and isn't customizable In size so It's just way to large and clunky, sending images just doesn't work, it keeps altering to samsung fitness for some reason?? It's not very accessible any more, Just makes me want to move back to like- skype or something. Blegh.",3
com.discord,Jeremy Brookley,"Guys, I'm not sure what happened, if a cat walked across the keyboard and released this version before it was ready but you broke everything. Videos don't show video anymore, just a black screen, text doesn't scroll with what you're typing properly on long messages, favorite emotes disappeared, you can no longer long press on things without restarting the app, etc. You need to fix these things or roll back cuz it's barely usable right now Update: currently broken - pictures/videos won't load",1
com.discord,Sakagai,"Discord is actually one of the only ways I talk to people.. Mainly because of how good looking the app is and how easy it is to use.. Daily conveniences such as sending important images to friends is quick and easy to do with just the tap of a button. (Unless you have to browse your images which include another app.) Discord is one of the apps I wish more were like/similar to.. I rarely experience bugs, but the ones that occur can always be fixed by refreshing the app (closing and re-opening it)",5
com.discord,Hhhh,"the latest update of the app compresses images, and thats fine but i would like an option to turn it off. i tried using the switch that pops up when it sends but it doesnt work. sometimes i like to send art, videos, images, etc in the highest quality but discord just compresses it. if you could turn that off thatd be super helpful as it gets pretty annoying if you cant really tell what a video is due to the severe lack of quality!! thank you for reading my inquiry",2
com.discord,Ali Arif,"I love discord, but the mobile experience is atrocious. The video chat constantly freezes when I'm just trying to chill and talk with the boys, and the touch controls during the calls are extremely unresponsive. It's not my phone, which has the newest snapdragon chip, nor my internet since I'm right next to the router. When the software experience improves, I'll improve my rating. For now, if you can stick with the desktop app, stay with that! Edit: to respond below: still occurs on cell & wifi",2
com.discord,Claire K,"Recently swapped from apple to android. The performance on android is HORRIFIC in comparison. There are so many performance, stability, and bug issues. Marking me as online when my phone is locked or the app is in background should not be marking me as online, marking messages I've read as unread, the app freezing and then completely refreshing itself, not giving me any notifications. It's really annoying and inconvenient. Would rather use the awful web browser. Yikes.",1
com.discord,Unknown Chicken,"I can't believe it, but Discord seems to be bug-free and enjoyable to use again! My main complaint is that not enough time seems to be spent in beta finding bugs - with each update I have to gamble on whether Discord will still be usable. While I appreciate the new features added in each update, the fact that they come with a plethora of bugs makes me less willing to update the app on a regular basis. However, this app remains my preferred method of communication with friends and fellow gamers.",4
com.discord,David McNamara,As of a couple months ago all video calls when running full screen freeze exactly at the 30 second mark video bitrate 0. When not full screen it's ok. Need to go back to the video chat (video small window) then swipe right to full screen again but the video freezes again at 30 seconds. Audio through all this is fine. Will probably bump rating if/when issue is resolved.,1
com.discord,Nezha The Immortal,"Could be better, though everytime this app updates there seems to be some ill-omened bug that's not far behind. Recently, I've stumbled upon an issue with the ""Tupperbox"" Bot, an entity that allows you to create faux accounts for fun and enjoyment. Up until just a few days ago, it was working just perfectly until it wasn't. There is a command, ‚ÄùTul!list‚Äù That brings up a list of your registered proxies, and to my surprise the buttons below the list used to navigate the list no longer exist. (?)",3
com.discord,Gerard Desjardins,"Discord just works. I don't know how it, but it's great. Wanna stream a game to your friends while watching your friends stream while playing a game on a different stream? No problem. How can do much video exist on one computer? It's easy to create a server and it'll take a couple hours of exploring to get good at managing channels and creating roles, but it works and it works well. The audio controls are super helpful. Key binds allow ultra customization.",5
com.discord,Annmarie Saldana,"Video calling freezes after a couple of seconds..the other person I was calling couldn't see me on their screen and it was black on their screen with a loading icon. And it never fixed. It continued to stay that way. As for me, I could see but on my screen it froze, so I could no longer see..but I could only hear them. Edit: not just video call problems but also problems with me not getting message notifications sometimes. Fix this app!",1
com.discord,Docchi,"The main problem here is the image selector and the image thumbnails that show up before sending. There are still loads of other problems, but the main thing to focus on is the ability to send images without using massive amounts of ram to both select and show image thumbnails prior to sending. please optimize it :(",1
com.discord,Anthony C,"I've hade the app for a while, but for some reason one of the channels was really laggy. I have two accounts, my main is perfectly fine, it's not laggy or anything. But my second is supper laggy, I just wanted to see a video that looked cool, but NOO the app wants to lag really hard when I try to see it. The other channels are fine but this one in particular is supper laggy. Edit: Now it won't let me do anything, when I go to a different channel it stays the same.",3
com.discord,Jack Skudlarek,"This is a virus. I uninstalled it in every insensible capacity on my PC yet I'll still see spare instances that reinstall EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL OVER AGAIN if I dare so much as glance at it improperly. It runs 24/7 and is unable to close so the numerous audio issues are unfixable ""just turn it off and"" its on the phentosecond I touch the power button and it's booting up to its last load, aka dumping me in the same call/stream/audio and video issues. If only I could restart it, but I can't.",1
com.discord,Gabriel Blaylock,"The new update is horrible. It's made looking back at past messages impossible. I'm not able to go back to a pin and simply read from that pin down. I have to hit the 'load more messages' button which changes where I was at on the feed causing me to need to scroll to find my spot. If I want to properly read something start to end on discord I have to hit a load button repeatedly and scroll around hoping I can find where I left off. And no, just like with everyone else, not a 'connection issue'.",4
com.discord,Dustin Wolf13,"Discord is cool, I've been using it for years(even before this account but this recent update really isn't my thing. The previous had me able to just click on the picture instead of having to ""trust this domain"" every time, and I'm not with the just seeing it. And the format is all weird, the text in the chat is significantly smaller than in my text box, the border, the spacing isn't fun, The new ""Friend nickname"" is fun but I'm not with anything else, I'd rather not have it updated at all :(",2
com.discord,sugarsomg,"the last several updated have made the app borderline unusable for me. My friends with apple devices are having virtually no issues, but for me and my other Android friends have been having so many issues. All UI icons are completely gone, I have to open my files to find any images, and a myriad of other issues that I dont have the space to list. Its not an internet problem either, strictly an app issue. Discord really needs to do something about this, bc this is just unacceptable at this point.",2
com.discord,Vince,"Icons are missing for channels, share buttons, and in a variety of other places after the most recent update. Closing and restarting the app does not fix the issue. The buttons I have encountered this on are still functional as long as you remember what spot does what, but the lack of visual indicators makes navigation difficult.",2
com.discord,Ace Timer,"The buttons used to call people on this app need to be hidden behind another button, like the three dots button, over 10 times there have been accidental calls in the past month or so, and it's not just me, even my friends have had accidental calls, it's extremely embarrassing and it could be worse if the other person picks up and you didn't mean to call them. When are you going to provide more security for these buttons, even water will push the button, it just happened to me right now.",1
com.discord,Corbin W.,"This app used to be fine, I'm a user from 2018 and 2019 - but the new updates have been messing it up so bad. It says I have misssed messages all the time and I have to check them? One time I opened the app and it messed up saying I had missed messages from every channel from years ago and it woukdnt go away so I had to check each one. Recently I cant even send a picture without it lagging or opening up two different links.. or completely closing the app out. Fix your damn app.",1
com.discord,Lt.Cdr. Chunk Chungus,"I don't know what happened, but about 4 months back, us Android users got screwed over in an update. Especially as of late, when I try to share a video that's only 3.03MB it says I cannot share the video because it's more than 8MB. Guys, I don't know what you did, but please go back to a previous version until you get this patched. I have an apple purely for testing purposes, and that exact same file was sent through with no issue.",1
com.discord,Joe Schmidt,"Fine when it works, but recently have only been able to view a single channel on the app. No support from discord development. Clearing caches from the app is greyed out, clearing from the apps on the phone doesn't help. All works fine from the web. It's a bug and no way I can find to get around it. Updating my review in response to the vendor reply. They gave me an email support that if I send useful information to, it says it's rejected. Their email support is not accepting requests.",1
com.discord,Cassie G,"I would give this 5 stars but I have a HUGE glitch to report. When I screen share, when I try to end it because I don't need to anymore, Discord freezes and I have to close the app and open it again, have it tell me it's not working, manually close it, and then it'll work. One time it was so bad I had to force stop it. I love using this but screen sharing just does not work. Please fix!",3
com.discord,Gage B.,"This app sucks now. There are so many glitches and annoyances that have been introduced into the latest updates. Video playback doesn't work most of the time, sending images is awful and laggy (it is not my internet connection, all of my friends have these two issues), and the app starts from where the last notification you clicked on took you to *everytime*. The Discord app used to be acceptable but it has just gone downhill recently.",1
com.discord,Shane the Freestyler,"Ever since the mobile UI overhaul, Discord has been horrendously slow! What used to be fairly snappy, if crowded UI has been replaced with a cleaner, yet unresponsive UI that at the worst of times will act as if a surver is empty whenever I switch to a different one! It makes navigation an outright slog if I want to quickly browse around like I used to. It also no longer remembers which channel in a server I was last in when switching.",1
com.discord,James Bradley,"Chat channels keep disappearing EXCEPT the last one I was using. Happens at least once a day. Have to delete & reinstall the app to get the groups back. Running on Android 13. Been an issues since mid/late August. Had to downgrade my review a star to get any response from support after trying to contact them initially. After giving me the run around for another month trying to make it seem like I was doing something wrong, support just said it's a known issue & that's all. Issue still persists.",1
com.discord,Streak The Hedgehog,"This app is pretty great! It's just that it can sometimes be VERY inconsistent, and the gui bugs out a lot.

So please, fix this app's performance issues and gui inconsistencies! Love ya!",4

I have uninstalled and reinstalled app; and did not have this problems until updating app.",3
com.discord,Jacob Riley,"Highly frustrating mobile client. The voice chat feature consistently fails to with with Bluetooth devices. This has been a known issue since 2020. A quick Google search reveals multiple users having this problem and 0 solutions I could find. It's a decent app for texting friends. A crapshoot right now for voice chatting. I have no idea why the devs haven't fixed a critical 2 year old issue, but common consensus online is that discord support won't help. A voice app without voice is useless.",2
com.discord,Ronan Flynn (Hidatsu),"Pretty good chat service! I've been using discord for a few years now (I think) and it's been a lovely experience. I've spent a lot of time both with a free account and a premium account. There isn't much quality lost on the free account, as everything has a lovely function ability. Paying the sub only gives you more boosts to performance and a few extra features, but fundamentally everything useful is free. They are always on top of disruptions in service, too.",5
com.discord,Fawful- 16,"The app is great, I've made so many friends! However, there's one issue I'd like to address and that's the roles that allow the color change of a name.

com.discord,FoxGirl,"This is an updated review. Ever since Discord sent out updates some time ago the more pressing issues have not been resolved. Images don't update in real time - app restart required. Sometimes messages don't load on time despite getting them as a popup - either wait, respond, or restart required. If you respond before it loads, it shows the user that is DM'd sent your message. Sometimes it takes a very long time to properly connect for the UI to load. I know these issues are not my connection.",2
com.discord,SSStylish Moonborne,"Absolute garbage since a few updates ago. Keyboard randomly pops up for no reason and can't be sent away without force closing the app. App is overall way laggier than it once was. I hear this is due to a true native Android version being replaced with a weird iOS converted version, and if that's true, shame on you for such laziness, discord. Fix this. EDIT: This all continues months later. The only thing that's been fixed is the text scrolling bug. Disappointing. Yes it's updated.",1
com.discord,Penelope K,"The new updates are ruining everything. We didn't need the new layout, or the glitchy profile, or the gallery change. I don't want to reset Discord everytime I want to send a new image. Discord is impossible to use atp it's so annoying please put it back to normal. The webhook update ruined so much things too. You changed things that didn't need to be changed.",1
com.discord,Tycon Xon,"The app was fine until like the middle of 2022. Everything was just so much worse; selecting an image is terrible, searching for an emoji is terrible, you can't even preview custom emojis anymore, recently the app just slows to a crash everytime a take a picture, and generally everything is slow and broken. I don't understand the need for the changes, the app worked fine in early 2022 and before that.",2
com.discord,Bryan (Pipeline929),"So discord as a whole I love but the Android app (at least what I'm experiencing) is a bit messy. Watching streams are a bit hard and for me personally on the s22 ultra I seem to not be able to use Bluetooth headphones in a voice channel on a server. Everything I Google says to go to the voice and video settings and change my audio device but my ""voice and video"" option just says voice and there is no option of audio device. App is up to date and been reinstalled but no change.",2
com.discord,Milky Moone,"Was good until they changed their UI, it absolutely sucks to do anything like screensharing because it just crashes. UI looks better-ish but there was really no need for change except they wanted more ""simplicity"". Turning off screenshare causes the app to crash, and its been months. It needs to be fixed. All of it needs to be fixed. Discord is nothing but a buggy mess nowadays.",2
com.discord,Adelina D,"Every time I open the app, my messages won't appear right away and just says ""connecting"" up top. I have to close the app completely and restart it.

com.discord,Lulu Howell,"Was originally a 5. Then a 4, a few weeks ago. Now its a 3. All of my previous problems still exist with other people sending messages I sent, and just generally an unfriendly and cluttered ui.

com.discord,Ojo,"I like it, it's my type of app in alot of ways. It's like any texting app but with more ways to expand. Definitely one of my favorite ""Social Medias"" you could say. As of recently though I've faced a few problems. Every single thing in the app that's supposed to show an image or icon is showing nothing but blank (such as status or friend list or dms or pings) and the mobile keyboard occupies the entire message box sometimes.",3
com.discord,Lee Flowers (Chickynugs),"Update: App was finally stable a week ago, though still buggy on my phone regardless of connection with slow loading of gifs and emojis, but usable. Now it's just broken when it comes to uploading images from my phone. It will freeze and eventually load the pic, but then freeze again. I also cannot download images, or get prompts if it did download. The app is extremely buggy still and these updates are just frustrating for what was a pretty good app.",1
com.discord,Hellcat 014,"This app is really good. A great chatting app and a good way to meet new people as well. There are times where certain things will go down, or not work properly, but I've found that it's not the apps problem, it's that my phone doesn't autoinstall updates for some reason. Overall, this app is great and easy to use, really good for connecting with people who share your interests from all over the world.",5
com.discord,Wilson Zuber,"The recent updates have resulted in massive battery drain that wasn't there before, along with a pretty laggy photo sending feature (regardless of wifi network and data). The app is wonderful in respects to being a way to communicate with others, but it just isn't optimized enough yet to be called a ""good"" app in my opinion. As someone who doesn't like it when developers push out updates with bugs in the hopes that the users will locate said bugs for the developers, I am deeply disappointed.",3
com.discord,Lizzie,"discord, how did you manage to get even worse? your past update sucked but was manageable. just when I thought I was getting used to it, you updated again and made it even worse. new bugs: I have to fully close the app if I want it to see that I have new images that I want to send and somehow, the unread message alert pops up every time I get a new message in a channel I'm in and being an active participant of. best of all, sometimes I just get no notifications. update: the update fixed nothing",1
com.discord,Kyrhlaan,"I've used discord since 2015, as it is still better than most other platforms for communication and the like. The most recent update has begun a myriad of destabilization with all the buttons and lack thereof, and not being able to properly respond to people without having almost accidentally calling a while group or accidentally removing them two or three times in a row. I'm going to wait until the next update for any improvements.",2

Videos will automatically pause 2-15 seconds in or just never play at all, no matter how many times you click it, images never load, call quality sucks, c'mon man, why are you being like most companies and going BACKWARDS? We're supposed to be going forwards, making things better, not whatever this is. Update: Can't download photos or videos now, and even if I could, I can't send them.",1
com.discord,Rockstar Fetch,"This app is super buggy. Idk but eveytime when I try to make a bio, it doesn't save and it keeps disappearing, same goes with adding a name too. [EDIT]: Emoticons automatically turn into emojis and there is no way to disable it except on a PC (and why would this even be a feature anyways??)‚Äì there are so many more options on PC than there is on mobile, and on Ipad (tablets, etc.), which makes my Discord experience pretty bad and eh :|",1
com.discord,Mason Hokanson,Fantastic app. Although since an update in August (not sure on that) the app has become very slow and is always struggling to send messages and connect. I would love it and many others would love it if this got fixed. It feels unusable at times. This is just for the android version though.,4
com.discord,StitchTheRavens,"Discord is amazing if you want to talk to others and do smaller roleplays, it's great until you need to upload a larger file or voice call.

It's great unless your intentions are to write full stories or longer conversations.",4
com.discord,Adrian Infante,"Discord itself is amazing. However: This app was fine before, but now it seems that every update fixes one issue and introduces a new one. First, overlay got removed. We got that back but the options were gone from it, then, we got that fixed, but now Bluetooth audio support is broken. Discord clearly is now struggling on how to make an Android app, and it's extremely sad. I use this program to communicate on the daily, and it's so frustrating having to put up with this terrible application.",2
com.discord,C. Q,"I love it to talk to friends here, but the more it tries to LOOK more advanced the more problems it has. I can't even reorder my channels anymore because they bugged the system trying to make it look fancy. In redoing how the layout of the app to look cool, the entire app is laggy and crashes often. How am I supposed to talk to my friends or make servers if, in exchange of looking more cool, the entire app acts up? I'm not the only one who has this issue either, all my friends have issues.",2
com.discord,Melissa Cerna (Mel),"Its really easy to get completely overwhelmed with notifications on this app. If you only want to get notifications from a couple channels on a server, you have to individually mute every other channel manually.

It drives me insane.",2

Also the new font is an eyesore and hurts to look at. I miss the old one, and I also miss how functional Discord used to be.",1
com.discord,WolfieisTrash,"After several updates, the discord app is still awful. When I try to play videos, the video randomly pauses and I can't unpause unless I scroll up or down until it's out of view, and then I have to start over and repeat. Gifs crash the app completely and don't play properly when fullscreened.

This is just lazy.",1
com.discord,Michael Fung,"Update since September 2022 has made the app go from super smooth to constant lag. Maybe it's just optimization issues with older phone models but this is ridiculous. My Samsung 8 phone is so laggy when Discord app is active. Even the digital keyboard becomes impaired, this app is suddenly pulling way too much processing power for really not reason. If I upload any image for sharing, the whole app lags so bad you might as well consider it freezing. Please fix it the app.",1

We can't hear each other, have to leave the call and re-join, you can't hear streams, videos break calls, overlay is broken. Just put it back to how it was",1
com.discord,bean gremlin,Still an awful app. Ever since the massive update over 2 months ago the app has been very broken. While some of the issues have been fixed it seems like everyday I run into a new issue. Automatic compression (THAT YOU CANT TURN OFF!) ruins video audio and sometimes sends images as files even if they're less than 1 mb. Videos often dont play and there are major issues with the connection. Typing is still slow and clunky compared to before the major overhaul. please just revert to the old version,1

Anytime I'm on a call, if the person I'm calling turns on their camera it freezes every few seconds, and the only way to unfreeze it is to minimize the call and maximize it again.

com.discord,Alex A,After the latest updates Discord has become almost unusable on mobile. the UI will slowly distort and become broken over several hours of use and I will often have to force stop the app to fix it. the app will crash randomly and kick me out of calls and the video compression is a terrible feature often multiplying the size of an uploaded video by 4! yes a 500KB video turned into a 2-3 MEGABYTE video while taking forever to compress it! I can deal with the bugs but please remove the compression.,1
com.discord,Kina Dunn,"I've used Discord since 2019, the mobile version used to be worse, but slowly improved over time until it was nearly perfect around June of this year, then an update was released that made doing almost anything a pain in the neck. Videos failing to load, occasional crashes and general bugs were introduced and are still a problem. If I was a conspiracy theorist, I'd say that the person who cleared the update for implementation was a Skype fanatic and couldn't stand seeing Discord take its place.",2
com.discord,cuzhe,"As of the latest update this app has become incredibly unoptimized and broken! Specifically when selecting images and videos to send The app lags hard when browsing media, even moreso then when I try to choose what I want to send. At the same time the camera feature can mess up at times, sending a picture but it only appearing as a file in chat Please fix these issues!!",2
com.discord,Mop Mop,"Mobile notifications have not worked at all for several versions now. I have them enabled in both the OS and app, yet none ever show up on the system notification bar. They do show up in-app if it's currently focused, and in the inbox screen. No other messaging app seems to be having this issue.",3
com.discord,Dane Lovell,"After the last update the Android speech to text will not work. It opens up and then shuts down immediately. And then I will upload a video that is 6-7 MB, it will show that, and then it will tell me that I can't upload anything bigger than 8 MB. Until this is fixed my ratings going to be two stars. UPDATE: after the latest update I am able to upload videos again. The speech to talk is still sketchy but it is better than it was.",4
com.discord,Venemorph hadlock,"I've not been receiving any notifications for the past couple days, server, DM, call, and even @ notifications. I wasn't on do not disturb, all permissions are allowed, uninstalling and logging out didn't help I even checked my other devices. My channels and servers aren't muted and I have no pending updates, I've tried everything and it still isn't functioning",1
com.discord,BirdsRepic,"The app was good before the update. (I'm on android mobile). Now i'm experiencing all sorts of problems such as the keyboard sticking on the screen when trying to exit out of it, which requires me to leave discord entirely. The channels look more compacted which doesn't seem rather appealing. Audio still plays sometimes when watching a video even when it's off screen or in a different channel. Discord freezes a lot of the time. And much more. Please fix these issues. Thank you very much.",3
com.discord,Lark Reid,"Ever since the new update me and other people that I know have completely lost the ability to upload more than one image/video at a time. It freezes on 70-100% when uploading multiple at a time. Now the audio on videos that I upload turn into static. I played the videos on my phone to make sure they weren't corrupted, and they are just fine. Sometimes when I open the app it gets stuck connecting and I have to restart it. Please fix your app asap. It's just not my phone that is effected.",1
com.discord,Oakmeal 52,"Works great when used for text and voice chat. However, the moment any sort of video comes on, everything gets choppy. And whatever you do, don't opt into automatic video compression. I thought it would make it easier to post videos larger than 8mb, but it actually compresses every video regardless of size. While it is almost completely unaffected visually, it replaces any audio the video had with static. The worst part is that there is no way to opt out of it.",2
com.discord,N R,"The update screwed me. I'm on an Android phone. Whenever a gif is sent in DM, whether by myself or another party, the app crashes. The only workaround I have is to go to my gallery and keep trying to send pictures until some (not all) are successfully sent, so the gif will no longer be on-screen. I have already filed a report on this. I hope the issue will be resolved. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. Crossing fingers.",3
com.discord,Westleigh Medlin,"This new update has introduced new features that are pretty strange and a few bugs. For some reason, even though the setting is turned off- gifs sent are automatically compressed an pixelated. Other file types are compressed, too. I wish that wasn't the case. The other problem is that gifs still autoplay even though the setting is turned off, including gifs in the file viewer when uploading files. At this point, I'd rather have the previous version.",2
com.discord,Cory Wilson,"Discord was perfect. The newest update has definitely ruined alot of things for me. First off, when I go to send a video it says it's compressing. After it finally sends, when you play it, the original audio is cut then sounds like TV static. Not only that but the layout for sending a picture or file actually has you browsing through your files instead of just scrolling through like they originally had. Discord please just go back to the old UI. The new update is awful. üòï",1
com.discord,Sustained Depression,"I have been using Discord since 2017, it is one of the greatest apps I have ever used. Such a good app that copy cats began popping up and following what Discord does. Regardless, because of the major UI update, the app has had numerous problems that were never problems from before. For Example, I can't upload multiple images at once but one at a time. It's always small things that builds up to a massive annoyance. I still love the app, and hope all the major bugs are dealt with in the future.",4
com.discord,Tobito,"As of the lasted update, its so damn hard to watch a clip of gameplay on mobile. More towards Android devices, can't say much for apple users. Once I tap on the clip I want to watch, I just sit there and wait for the clip to load, which doesn't come to an end. It just loads there forever. Even if I exit the app, clear it and reopen it, same issue. Please fix this. These problems mainly occur when I try to watch a clip from a rendering bot.",2
com.discord,Diana Dempsey - Gibson,"An extremely useful app. I like the fact that unlike the social apps that you share things with strangers, this allows a much more direct and personal communication. Love the fact we can share one on one, or groups of friends. Sharing photos, videos, information, help organize events, contests, or take polls. We can verbally communicate freely and clearly with friends around the world. My only issue is, Lately, they've added so much junk, its causing games to crash or lag when using this app.",4
com.discord,Becca McClure,"The recent update has completely messed up the app for Android users. I've logged in on android, iOS, and PC, and I only ever have problems with the Android version. The app is constantly crashing. It will freeze on startup. I can't even check any kind of messages or notifications I get throughout the day on my android, because the app will just freeze on the last screen it was open to before crashing, no matter how many times I try to refresh the app. It's extremely frustrating.",3
com.discord,Jason Martin,This app was great. Was. Performance was awesome. Convenience was paramount. The layout was great and aesthetically pleasing. Now they have absolutely ruined it. The layout is hideous. It's all over-animated. Features are clunky or buggy. The layout is big and unpleasant to navigate. How on earth did they mess it up this bad!? It was perfect!,1
com.discord,Rob Stemen,"It's a very well-done and useful app, but has a pretty annoying issues on foldable devices. It has a small screen and a large screen mode, which are both great, but it does not do anything to switch between them. When the device is opened/closed. In order to get the correct view, the app has to be fully killed and restarted. It's fine going from small -> large, but going from large -> small makes the app unusable without a restart.",4
com.discord,Kyle Pearson,"Great UI, but the most recent 2 or 3 updates have the unintended effect of causing the selected channel to scroll all the way up or all the way down when you tap the screen (sometimes). Makes it really hard to watch videos and view images since you have to tap the embed to even view the content properly. I thought this was just a setting but I can't find where to turn it off, so now I'm convinced it's just a bug the devs either haven't seen or don't intend on fixing just yet.",2
com.discord,Jess,"Discord used to be nearly flawless, but the recent updates have caused it to crash. A lot. Every time you click on a message notification, it'll open the app but be in a perpetual ""connecting"" loop, then crash. It'll also randomly stop allowing messages to be sent or claim a message in sent, crash, and when you re-open it's not there. Uninstalling and re-installing doesn't change anything.",2
com.discord,cinna minna,"I used to be super impressed by how the video calls worked way better than other apps on my phone. Now, everything I video call, the other person's video freezes in place on my end and I have to swipe out of full screen and go back in it just to get it to work again. it's become really annoying to say the least, and I have no clue on how to fix it.",2
com.discord,Sneasel,"This version isn't even comparable to the PC version. With the amount of issues, it's near unusable. I've had to reinstall the app multiple times because of various issues that should be easily fixable, including but not limited to: Features not loading (icons, images, voice chat buttons, etc.), incredible lag, and the app repeatedly crashing for no reason. [Edit:] As of now (10/6/22), the app is completely unusable to me because it crashes immediately after I open it, even after reinstalling.",1
com.discord,Oaklen Haney,"Updating: The problem isnt being fixed. So 2 stars were too much, I'm resorting to one star, I'm done with this. The app has issues. It would work better and be more enjoyable if the audio didn't cut out often. I'm having to constantly (literally every 4 seconds, no exaggeration) hang up the call so that it doesn't freeze. I know it's not a wifi internet issue, because nothing has changed from either end in that department. My review can change when the app is fixed.",1
com.discord,Reid Cunningham,"This app used to be perfect, but since August or something, video playback and loading is downright awful. If I want to view a video someone uploaded, it will either freeze and lead to a black screen or not play at all. Very rarely do videos actually play. I also have an issue in which It takes forever for content to send. If I want to send two very small pictures, it just won't send. I have to send them all individually.",2
com.discord,Conner Morgan,"It's a great communicating app that is fast, easy to use, and enjoyable! Definitely a great app for all your communication needs, whether you are a gamer or not! They are always adding new features! To be honest this needs more than five stars. :) (However at the current moment the recent updates to the app have made it kind of broken, especially regarding images and videos, sometimes they appear partly off the screen and and finicky to get them playing, sometimes menus don't display properly.)",3
com.discord,Rob Boss,"This is only for the latest update. I don't know how people thought it was a good idea to ruin the mobile app by modifying it to be similar to the desktop version. My main concerns is how text looks. The spacing is annoying (I've played with the text settings already). When sending photos, it won't show your entire gallery (it loops photos). And more that are mostly personal peeves that cannot be changed in the settings. Good app ofc but I wish I could revert back to earlier update.",2
com.discord,Ciara Helm (LizzardLady),"Some of the previous issues are fixed, but still having trouble. Images don't want to send sometimes, and then when they do, messages from the other person all send at once like the app is trying to play catch-up. Sometimes an image will send twice, but the second one will send later (either minutes later, or like half an hour later). Sometimes my messages take ages to send as well.",1
com.discord,princeofallhallows,"The new update makes me feel like I'm having a stroke. I have discord on multiple clients, and I understand the appeal of trying to make it look and feel more like desktop. However, I have never had a worse experience trying to type, switch channels, or send messages at all. Not to mention that the new text scaling is impossible to get used to and the delay between hitting send and your message going through is nearly a minute on some occasions. My phone has never lagged this much in my life.",5
com.discord,JarOCats,"It works fine for the two servers I've been invited to. Problem is, I see no way to find any other servers; this app lacks the ""explore"" / ""compass"" button I've read so much about. Seems the only solution is to use the Web version, which is way too small on a phone, and out of the question on a laptop (no home intertubes out in the sticks -- only phones). If I'm missing some other method of discovery, I wish someone would let me in on the secret; right now, this app is just taking up space.",3
com.discord,Daisy,"The recent update (and supposed fix for it) has made the app not user friendly. Chats scroll up on their own. Upon opening a chat, even when the app is open and running, there's a prompt that vanishes after a second for me to block or report the person I'm messaging, as if they're sending me a message for the first time. I miss the old way of looking for photos to send in the app. Please put it back to how it was.",1
com.discord,Peepaboo,"Love this app, but the latest update is awful. I appreciate the attempt to make the mobile app more like the PC app, but something needs to be done about this lag. I'll be browsing and suddenly the whole app will freeze. It takes two minutes for it to switch servers sometimes. The emote/gif pop-up lags. The keyboard lags. Sometimes it's so bad that the app will cut me off mid-sentence and only send half of what I typed. Thank goodness I don't use voice chat on mobile, I'm sure it's even worse!",2
com.discord,OJ,"Overall, the setup and design is perfect. There's lots of add-ons that make the experience better, and it's an easy way to connect with any group. Unfortunately Discord on mobile is disappointing compared to PC. It glitches/crashes daily, sometimes freezing while uploading an image (and certain messages, chats, and images will disappear temporarily). Bug fixes are desperately needed since the recent update, but after that, it would be an easy 5 stars.",4
com.discord,Fiorela Zamora,"It use to be good on mobile. Now icons are missing on overlay but the functions are still there. Crashes and kicks me from calls when it never did that before. Overlay is practically useless because it never lights up or even recognizes the other person talking, just me. And then it disappears if you click away. The call box just stays on your screen if you click on another chat or server, and it blocks so much. You can't make it smaller or get rid of it. There is still so much.",1
com.discord,Michael Bartner,"Discord is a great voice and chat platform for communities and friend groups. And the mobile version is pretty solid, with the only exception being that notifications from recived messages on mobile can be very hit or miss. With sometimes it pops up within seconds, while other times it will take anywhere from 10-30 mins to arrive with a chance it won't arrive at all. Now this could vary based on settings on your phone, but from my friends experiences it seems consistent. 4/5 with this problem.",4
com.discord,Darude Sandwich,"please just revert the changes, they were unnecessary and only caused problems. it was fine and a lot of ways better than the iOS version. it was the best version of mobile there was and it became so much worse. it was way less intuitive to use, video chat is now super awkward and inconvenient, and not being able to send compressed photos is a major deal breaker.",1
com.discord,Johnathan Kamuda,"Been using Discord for many, many years. They are always making it better. It's become so much more robust and feature filled since I first started using it. And it's platform to pay for extras is great. You don't NEED to, but it's nice to have that kind of service a available if we wanted some perks. I think some of the options could be laid out better. Personal example - changing individuals volume in a call, not an intuitive option to find at first. Things like that fixed, would be perfect.",5
com.discord,David M,"Amazing app. I use it all the time to game online with friends. You can make your own space (a.k.a. ""server""), invite who you want, and devote it to anything you want. Good for group or one-on-one calling, chat, sharing memes and videos, and streaming your screen for friends to watch. If I could change one thing, it would be to improve the audio quality in calls. Most of the time it is fine, but sometimes people's mics cut out or are distorted. But other than that, amazing app.",5
com.discord,Clyde Cartwright,Update: 2 months later and it's still broken on a flagship device. No fixes at all. To make it better they've released an update that only allows PC users to play games amongst each other leaving mobile in the dark. This update is riddled with bugs. Overlay is completely broken. Won't show who's talking and the controls are just non-existent. The app itself is worse. Press and holds on profiles randomly work once in a blue moon. And you want to change the volume on someone just forget it.,1
com.discord,erik garland,"Discord says it actively rolling out new updates to fix the many problems created by the ""update"" (more of a downgrade), yet none of the problems I or other people have been experiencing have been fixed. For one, discord always resets when I exit the app, even for a split second to go into my files to find a video or photo( another issue), Which creates the issue of only having so many files I can access. I'd ask y'all to fix it, but at this point I don't think you will.",1
com.discord,Sal Watson,"Original: It's obvious that the latest update is just a lazy port of the iOS codebase. Half the time, nothing loads, so I have to exit and restart the app multiple times. When it does work, it's slow and unreliable. If you still have an older version, don't update if you can help it. EDIT: With a previous update, all the icons were invisible, making it impossible to tell which button is which (or if a button was there). It's fixed now, but that bug should never have made it through QA.",1
com.discord,Trinity Comerford,"Good app, although annoying at times. Sometimes I get stuck in certain areas, unable to swipe out of a text channel and having to use the back button on my phone. Also, sometimes I am unable to swipe up or down to get to a certain server. I always just have to close the app all the way and re-open it. I also am having trouble with the image sending. After going offline for a while, I came back and now, even though I'm using my fast home wi-fi, I am unable to send multiple images at a time.",3

I can't send multiple files at once anymore, the font sizes keep changing, making things impossible to read, gifs are completely broken and end up causing severe lag, and I constantly have to go back and refresh channels individually so that they're marked as read. These are just some of the strangest and most annoying bugs I've been experiencing in the last month...",2
com.discord,Ghosty whosty,"I've been using discord since around 2019 and I can say it's changed a lot, both for better and for worse. It may just be my phone but I can't send multiple images at a time and I can only send one and they load very very slowly and again this may just be my phone but sometimes it entirely crashes and I have to fully close out the app and re-open it so it can work smoothly again but it crashes constantly and it's very tiring. Overall, it's a good app just a bit buggy and could use some updates",4
com.discord,Gwendolyn MacTiernan (KittKatt),"Well, here we are months after the latest updates, and this app is so bad I'm considering not using it at all anymore. Bugs, bugs, and more bugs, from visual glitches, to crashes, to odd behavior. And the worst of all, if you want to voice chat, don't even bother. The audio for voice chats and streams is terrible, and best of all, it absolutely tanks the audio quality of literally every other app you use. Seriously, if there is an alternative, use it. This app isn't worth it anymore.",1
com.discord,sweet tarte,"Ever since the updates in September/October, the video calls have frozen and it's progressively gotten worse. When I video call, the person's video will freeze but their audio will be fine. The app is up to date and everything, my wifi is fine. Everything was fine until these updates. The freezing happens every minute or less and it's so frustrating to have to try to fix it only for it to freeze again. Please fix this.",2
com.discord,Adrian G,"Love the app, it's the social media site I use the most often. But I do have a couple critiques because they're pretty important functions. The video chat/phone function is pretty poor quality, when it works at all. It can be really hard to set up a live stream (especially on a mac). And the size limit for pics and videos without nitro is a joke. I can't even send a 10 second compressed video or 3 pics at once. That said, I use it all the time and prefer it to other apps.",4
com.discord,Rain,"The latest update provides the change to changing colors for your profile theme (if you have nitro). When I tried changing the default color to Orange (for the Halloween aspect), it just returned back to its default color (which was white).

com.discord,Ava Jennings (Ava),"it was working just fine until i updated it. (I'm on android mobile) it will NOT. STOP. CRASHING. it's awful, it just freezes every time i open the app and then crashes. i have tried everything. not only that, but it keeps sticking and lagging. and the font sizes are all kinds of screwed up now, and if i try to make it bigger so it looked the way it did before, it's TOO big. it also refuses to send more than one images, it gets stuck at either 2% or 80% and just gives up. Please do something.",1
com.discord,Butterfly Girl,"Not very mobile friendly. Especially, if you play Epic rpg. Being on Discord from mobile is my only option, and I have to constantly clear cache, and force stop the app. The app freezes, lags, and crashes way too much.

com.discord,Candy,"While it was going smooth initially, and I was happy to see the update for the profile colors, everything else needs fixing. I can't upload two pictures at a time. I can't click on a message notification when not using the app, because it takes me to a blank/not loaded screen, and the only way to see it is to close the app and open it again. And now the settings icons aren't showing up on the bottom of the screen? (ie; friends, notifications, etc.) This recent update is so buggy!",2
com.discord,Joel Flintstones,"Recently, I've been having some obnoxious issues. For example, if I try to send a picture or video, it will send, but it won't show up that I sent it on my end until I reboot the app. If I'm in a direct message and switch to a server, sometimes instead of taking me to the channel I was last in on that server, it keeps me in the direct message. Weirdest of all, messages from other people occasionally show as being sent by me, and vice versa. Why are these updates causing more bugs than they fix?",2
com.discord,Nova Bertsch,"So, Discord is an app I've been using for several years for various things. Most prominently roleplay with my close friends. Recently I've been having issues with it on my phone that are disruptive to that. Such as load time issues of channels, avatars, and images. And more recently, my image browser not working. I've found that reinstalling the app usually helps. But I should not have to reinstall it for features that should just work.",3
com.discord,Suzy Yu,"A great way to meet others across the world and keep in touch with them and with family. Not as crazy or overwhelming as FB. It is accessible on your laptop or any mobile devices. Only problem is when using it through any browsers, it won't scroll and give you all the options offered, like the full list of all with the ""@"" or with the ""#"" (not even with ""slash"" commands either.) Yet many perks can only be accessible within browsers and not available in the app itself. Plus, I update always.",3
com.discord,Mewtex,"This app is easily a 5/5, however the recent update that re-worked the UI is not something I like. I know I doubt itll be brought back, but the old UI with the new mix of sounds would have been perfect. This new UI and display is too big and overbearing, and I much preferred the smaller, better UI. It would be great to get it back, as scaling down the text just looks bad in general.",1
com.discord,Jane C,"It's a great app really! But right now, I don't know what happened. I have 5G internet with full bars and it kept saying ""Connecting..."". I was like 20 minutes before calling my friend and it started acting up. Nothing was wrong with my wifi at all, I disconnected my earbuds because my friend said he couldn't hear me and it was sounding weird to him, so the moment I disconnected it, it freezes for a while. Please fix it. Great app overall though!",4
com.discord,Mdbgamer,"The team has messed the app up badly. I used to use Discord all the time, and even at its laggiest, it was never this horrifically bad. I don't mind some of the UI changes so much, but whatever you guys did to the core system, it takes on average 10 to 15 seconds to get any taps, messages, pictures, or even switching channels or servers to even happen from first tap. Doing literally anything on the latest update is painfully slow. Down to two stars only because it's still accessible.",2
com.discord,Troy Andrade,"I use discord on a daily basis and rarely have issues with it, but now recently when I try to send a video, it automatically compresses it before uploading, and when it finishes and sends, it turns to audio to a very loud static so nothing is able to be heard except static. Only one time did it not compress, and the audio came out perfectly fine. I don't know what this is but this is extremely frustrating.",3
com.discord,Khalil Estell,"Absolutely love Discord! My all time favorites communication app. I use it for friends, family, and business and it's served me very well. The mobile client has glitch where it always returns to the last state it was in on, then switched back. It's disorienting but not too bad. The desktop app can't seem to handle spotty internet so it hangs quite often. Otherwise a fantastic app and service baring some things that need to be polished.",5
com.discord,Mr. Doomguy,"I've used alot of apps in my lifetime, and none have made me hate using it from so many bugs, in my life. For example, when I type things in, the keyboard gets stuck in a repeated cycle of actions. All it does is prompt the keyboard to slide up, then the keyboard disappears (rendering the screen useless) because the keyboard just keeps showing up on the screen and then I will cancel out so many times that if you just leave the phone alone the bug is literally running the app. This is ridiculous",1
com.discord,Shawn,"I've been using this app since 2017 and up until recently it's been a near flawless experience. However, recently there was an overhaul ,for lack of better terminology, of the interface and it has almost entirely ruined the app. Constant crashes, input delay, massive lag spikes, you name it, it happens. And as of recently, I cant even send videos as it spends several minutes compressing even the smallest videos just for them to send with corrupted audio so loud it hurts to listen to.",2
com.discord,Deltaroni,"Discord was great before the update, the layout was nice and comfortable and worked pretty well to keep in contact with friends, but now it's nearly impossible to use and feels cramped. It has to reconnect every time I open the app and takes forever to load up new messages. It won't even give me notifications anymore, if I want to see the new messages quickly I have to stay on the app. My friends have been having the same issue too. I'm not sure what exactly you guys did, but you need to fix it.",1
com.discord,Floofy Boi,"I've had all sorts of problems before the update. App hangs and sometimes crashes at startup, the app was slow and clunky, and took so much ram that my UI crashes a lot. After the update however, things have been a lot better. Loading times are much faster, I like the new UI, and things feel way snappier. However I have one issue. I can't watch videos. If I watch from the UI player it crashes instantly and if I watch from the standalone player, it hangs and then crashes. Hope this is fixed.",3
com.discord,Alex Vander Heul,"Just updated and the app won't let me tap on the text box to type, scroll up and down in channels, or open/upload pictures or play videos anymore. The only things I can do is swipe left and right and change channels, but I can't interact within those channels. edit: I swiped right and tap/held another member in the channel to start a PM with them, and after that screen changed to the PM, I got full functionality back. I'm glad I'm not stuck anymore, but still very buggy behavior.",2
com.discord,Anna S,"I really tried but I can't stand this app. While I don't use many of the community features, the ones I do use suffer the same issues as the rest of the app: a poor unintuitive interface and glitchy performance. The voice feature is constantly being updated but as soon as it's working well they change it again. The interface was working fine on my Zfold 3 but suddenly it's cut off on the outer screen so I can't send texts. The fact that they expect folks to pay a subscription is laughable.",2
com.discord,Anthony Mayer,"Not as good as it used to be. Ran into a bunch of issues where messages don't just not send and offer a resend option. They just don't send. At all. Then you have to retype everything. As a student who uses this for group projects, it really makes it easy to drop the ball because messages just don't send. On top of notifications remaining unread, users typing not appearing, default opening to a random channel, and the looking at user profiles straight up having nothing but the name and icon.",1

I have full signal, excellent wifi, and out of nowhere it will cease to load. I keep gettig notifications from the messages I receive but when I open the app, it is forever loading. I don't know what happened, but it's substantially unreliable right now. I have tried to make a support ticket and even that website has trouble loading. So sad.",1
com.discord,Braxton Driver,"Discord is a great app for talking to friends, communication, and more. But recently for mobile users with the latest update, it's become a lot harder to use discord. It's like your using it as if your on a PC or laptop. Moving roles causes me to freeze, moving channels lags it out and images I post are extremely compressed. I feel it should take a step back with one of the older versions of discord, is it possible to use an older version of discord?",3
com.discord,Brody Cheney,"the ugliness of the app is still here and it's still really slow, but there's a new issue: video compression. it compresses the videos and they end up larger than before. it put a 4mb video up to 16mb, making it unusable. it also sometimes messes up the audio, replacing it with static. it's actually like you just want people to stop using the platform.",1
com.discord,Technobl ade,"I've been using this for a couple years, it's been great, I've kept in touch with my friends, met new ones from the variety of servers. It's great for calling, video call, music sharing, nitro is easy to use and simple payment as well as keeping your information safe. But I'm giving it 3 stars because of recent developments. The bot prefixes are harder, more complicated for mobile and PC, it started glitching alot more. Some servers on mobile are messed up, words overgoing each other. Thank you",3
com.discord,error / charlie,"The app has been fine for years. As of late, however, discord has been rolling out so many updates for no reason. The very definition of don't fix what's not broken, they continuously change what the app looks like and how it functions. It used to run incredibly smoothly, yet after updating, it's so slow and has been absolutely killing my battery.",2
com.discord,Daniel Guerrero,"Discord has worked flawlessly for me since the moment I first downloaded it. However, these recent updates have completely ruined my experience for the app. Whenever I try sending videos under 8mb, it ""compresses"" the video and ultimately makes the file bigger which is completely the opposite of what it's meant too do. I send a compressed video that I did myself and the audio for it gets completely replaced by loud static which I don't understand how that even happens. Revert the updates!",1
com.discord,Juregekk ‚Ä¢,"Okay, just unbearable. every update comes with some different bug that totally ruins the experience in the app. in this last update, the videos freeze when they are opened in full screen, there is an annoying delay when I change servers. besides, now it's much more boring and difficult to modify the profile, and sometimes it doesn't even save the changes....",2
com.discord,Jimmy Neutron,"Very solid app and a very good way to communicate with others! I love the fact that you can discover new people by exploring new servers and make your own. The amount of things this app can do is great and I will continue to use it for chatting with my friends. However there's a couple times where the scrolling of text channels and messages gets messed up and hides the bottom parts. Idk if this is like a wifi issue or anything else, but it usually goes away after I close and open the app again.",5
com.discord,Tiffany Tran,"I like the search and pin feature on Discord so I may find messages or images that I want to save. Discord devs are also responsive to reviews than other social media apps. However, the desktop app has more features for easier access, appearance, and efficiency. Makes sense though, since it's mostly for gamers, but it does get annoying when I can't use my second account. I recommend using SuperClone on Discord for it. With the recent update, I can't preview my videos before sending. Meh.",3
com.discord,Brandon Boyd,"Half the channels in my friends server keep disappearing for me, and I can't post in them until sometime else does and I get a notification, and it shows back up. Also, I'll make a post, then make another a while later and it'll run them together like it's the same post, even though a lot of time has elapsed. Most of the .gifs aren't showing up. Clearing cache/data or reinstalling the app fixes it, for like an hour or two... Shouldn't have to do that multiple times a day. This is all new...",2
com.discord,birthday!!!man,"My Issues : 1. The layout change was so unnecessary; everything is harder to find and the organization is off. Texts send slow + no more wide screen, which sucks -- it's really confusing. 2. Everytime I join a voice call in DMs, it always joins me unmuted. Again, unnecessary touch ups. Plus the amount of loud effects that plays when I join / leave a call. I don't need to hear all of that. Even if I turn down the volume, it's still loud. The Android Update is a waste of time. Thanks, Bee.",3
com.discord,David Watt,"It's been good to me for a while, but after the last few updates, it's only been useful for text messaging. Any form of file sharing has been utterly demolished, to the point where just trying to send a friend a 2 or 3 second long video causes it to be compressed to a pixelated, static-noised mess. I know Discord wants everyone to spend money on their stupid subscriptions, but that's no reason to make non-paid users suffer.",2
com.discord,Matthew Dingman,"I have used discord for a couple years now, and It was great. The latest updates, however... They ruined the UI, moved a whole bunch of buttons, and made the app way more resource demanding, to the point where my phone barely runs it, and it frequently crashes. It even got to the point where my device resarted ITSELF. Please add some sort of option for us with low-end devices.",2
com.discord,Donald Lugo,"This is a must for any gamer! Just to chat, play and talk or maybe just show of your games. You can also tip each other if your stuck. The only thing I'm gonna say is that some times it glitches and voice won't go through. You must exit server and re-enter. It does not happen to every body, so is perhaps lag sensitive? It happens a lot more on phone network than wifi, but I do have a friend with slow net constantly needing reconnect. On pc I never have this issue, is only on the app.",4
com.discord,Jesvin Jose,"The latest update is not gois. The app is slow and it's buggy, when I swipe right to go change the channel, my profile info comes up. The UI change is fine but the channel button size feels small. I do quite like the new UI for the picture selection though. Its more neat and tidy. I also like the addition of some more settings. I prefer the old way the status changing thing looks but the new one is fine.",3
com.discord,Chatmendy,"Everything works most the time. However, the last few updates have made everything.work less on mobile. Whether it's the overlay being completely useless now only showing when you speak along with the drop down options not appearing . In a server with a lot of channels there's a glitch that makes all the channels at the bottom inaccessible needing you to close and reopen the app to get them back. Finally, with the last few UI changes in a VC they made it more inconvenient to adjust ppls volume.",3
com.discord,HarDe One,"CURRENTLY BROKEN ON GALAXY S10e! Discord has functioned fine for years, this is the first issue I've ever had. Just updated the app, and now it crashes while trying to connect to the server. This is clearly an issue with the app itself, if it was having an actual issue with connect8ng to the server, the channel list would be blank and it'd say it cannot connect. The crash means it's something to do with the app itself.",3
com.discord,Gacha stuff123,"Bunch of new updates to ""fix"" what was already perfect. Trying to move to the same sort of system as the pc application is smart, but it's causing so many problems with this app that it's almost unbearable. I click on a notification to access a message, half of my favorite emojis are gone. I try to find a server, it's disappeared. I have to continually close and reopen the app for it to work. Discord was better before, let's go back to that",3
com.discord,Caden Bentley,"Edit: Don't do the update, y'all. I very reluctantly downloaded the update to see if it would fix anything and it actually made things worse. It now lags whenever I type anything too fast, even slower trying to go to new messages, anytime I click back to the app it displays the beginning conversation the channel/DM, was already having trouble with the app refusing to allow me to use voice to text but it absolutely will not work. I'm so extremely disappointed in how this is being handled.",1
com.discord,B. S,"I've used Discord for years and never really had a problem with it, but the last few updates have made it run worse. I updated to the latest version, but keep getting messages that it's still connecting. I also sometimes don't see the most recent messages in servers and have to keep exiting out & reopening the app. It's gotten to a point where I'm writing a review, which I never do.",3
com.discord,Cali Nuff-Said,"The new update with notification sounds not being able to turn off, is quite annoying to the fact that I don't really want to use the app a while lot. It's been fine for the most part since I have used it since it was only browser based. But these recent updates have annoyed to the point that I got to say something. I only ask for the option to turn off notication sounds.",4
com.discord,SBF,"Alright so there's definitely a bunch of things off with the app ever since it started receiving these periodic updates. Discord now has a tendency to crash whenever I click on any chat notifications, images have to be sent one at a time from a device (that might just be me), and though the call overlay buttons work, it's incredibly laggy and doesn't show who else is in a call by lighting up when they speak. This might be an intentional design choice, but it does make things a bit inconvenient.",1
com.discord,John,"I've never really had issues with the app before, but it's been almost unusable with this week's update. Everytime I click a notification the app hangs and only has a 50/50 chance of actually bringing me to the message I clicked the notification for. Very slow and unreliable right now. Hope you guys are able to revert the changes and bring it back to how it was before.",3
com.discord,N A,ever sense the recent updates the app has been horrid. It doesn't show all of my images and instead shows the same ones over and over again. Not only that but to even send images I have to send one at a time. I can view all of my images by going to my files but if I select them it kicks me off the app. on top of that I can't join a server anyways unless it's a direct link sent to me. if I try to join another way it kicks me off.,1
com.discord,Quite Bluish,"I used to have no complaints about this app, and would use it as much as the PC app. However as of recent updates, the app has become incredibly buggy and frustratingly difficult to use. In fact there's SO many bugs I've experienced with the recent update that I literally cannot fit them into this review. This is frustrating. I loved this app and it was fine the way it was. Now it's broken and annoying. Most of the times I have to reset Discord entirely to fix anything. Just use the PC app.",1
com.discord,Carter,"It was solid until the latest update. Now posting pictures or videos are iffy, gifs and videos show up black or muted, and trying to react to images requires you to press the top rather than the general message box. (Edit: Now it is even worse. Videos and photos take longer to post, and for videos you run the risk of when they are uploaded the sound is loud static instead. What is going on???)",1
com.discord,Gianna G,"I love discord. It's become my main source of communication over the years however I dislike making calls on my phone with it. For a few years now if my phone's screen turns off then it also cuts me off from the call. I can hear my friends but they can't hear me. So I have to keep my display on if I do have to make long calls. It didn't use to be like this, sad :c Also again using discord on my phone, if I'm away from the app itself for more than a few minutes then it cuts my voice off as well.",3
com.discord,Pringle 1,"Used to be an amazing app. However ever since the august update it's been horrible. I can't even type without clicking on it multiple times for my keyboard to appear. Audio calls have major issues. I can't leave the app without it disconnecting me from the call, and calls make it harder to type. I can't even upload files hardly anymore. I think this is just an Android thing though? Other people have been having the exact same issues. It's not my phone or wifi I made sure of that. Fix this asap.",1
com.discord,MEMESCOEP,"I love discord, but recently there have been a few problems. Most issues are solved by restarting the app, but ever since the discord nitro basic update, I can't upload videos without them being extremely loud, to the point where it's just static. The videos play just fine, but the audio is completely messed up. I hope this will be fixed soon.",3
com.discord,Rin Kazuki,"Since the August update, I have experienced freezes after only typing in servers I frequently visit. It's also unresponsive prior to. I have wait a literal minute before I can even forcibly close the app. I don't know the reason for these changes, but from I've read on other reviews, the Discord team is alienating a LOT of people. It may have something to do with the Xbox update, but I can't be too sure.",1
com.discord,Kiko,"There are so many problems with the new update. There's always this weird gap in between the first message and second one; If it only takes up one line, it leaves this gap of space. I've found another problem, which is that every video I post ends up having this ear busting static, despite it not sounding like that when I saved the file or when I watch it through my gallery.",2
com.discord,Rorschach The Vigilante,"After the latest couple updates, the app has become a major pain to use. My biggest pet peeve is that if you start playing a video before making it full screen, it freezes and will not play until you exit the app and restart. Videos will randomly corrupt upon downloading, with no relation to the file format. It worked just fine a couple months ago and now it's just completely broken. For the love of God, fix this.",2
com.discord,Jonathan Sancha,"Video player barely works. Sometimes shrinks to 2/3 of the screen. The player also sometimes glitches out, making it impossible to scroll or skip to certain parts. Gallery view is busted in the sense that if you try saving and scrolling, you'll end up with multiple copies of the first image in the chain of posts. I'm also not a fan of having to leave gallery view to see other image chains.",1
com.discord,Arietta Miller,"The new updates are downright awful. The previous format was better, less confusing, and less laggy. The only reason it's getting 2 stars is because it was better than this. With the new mobile updates, you also cannot see many of your gallery images. You CAN'T send multiple files either. It's stuck forever sending. And don't even try and get help from the help email on the playstore. It's unsupported.",1
com.discord,Reza CatThing,"Ever since they dropped independent development for the android version of the app, it's been functioning horribly. Went from workable, to an absolute nightmare. How is it that you've gotten so lazy that you refuse to make sure the app actually functions properly for people? Uploading multiple images just no longer works on android, everything loads slowly, or not at all, no matter the connection. It's an absolute joke. Edit: whatever connection I use does not change this at all. I have tried.",1
com.discord,DVC Minis,"I've been paying for Nitro for the past 5 months I believe but I'm not sure it's been that worth it. I started paying for it so that I could send videos more than 8mb but the 100mb upgrade isnt that much better. It makes it hard to even send a 1 minute clip without having to cut a ton of it just to send it which is very limiting. I wish they would allow you more upload space, st least 200mb. I use this app all the time to keep in touch long distance so the 4,000 characters is a great bump up.",3
com.discord,Dae Wolfward,"I use it all the time. There are always some issues with it, like cutting out audio and random disconnects, but I prefer using discord over anything else. Honestly, the biggest thing I wish I could do was put a custom tone for my texts, but neither my phone nor discord will allow that. The ability to stream is great, the threads and new forum features are helpful, and the ability to organize channels however you need is amazing. Setting role permissions per channel is kind of annoying though.",4
com.discord,Brian Dieball,"It's a great app for keeping in touch with friends and others with similar interests. The only real complaints I have is the occasional, lack of any notifications despite having several messages waiting for me and when it doesn't tell me someone is trying to start a voice/video call. Otherwise it's a good app overall that I get daily use out of.",4
com.discord,Atlas,"Discord mobile app used to work just fine, I'll even add perfect. When the new updates came about, it completely ruined my experience with the mobile app because videos do not load, and can not send multiple images like it used to. Discord, I know you mean well, so please fix these issues. (Yes, I'm using the latest version).",1
com.discord,DJ 101,"Really good set up and customization of servers to help organize talk channels. Audio calls also work as attended with a good amount of ping. But, a con would be most of the time the frame rate gets low or the video or streaming in general gets choppy easily. It's hard to keep up with what a person is trying to show when it lags most of the time. Along with bugs with the noise suppression and microphone turning off and on. But, overall, it's a good app to use to chat with friends.",4
com.discord,Birb Vibes,"I literally hate the new update, everything looks weird, and the messages pop up suddenly instead of sliding into view, emoji toggle is gone, search bar looks different, the gallery for sending images looks different, I hate all of it. Not to mention it comes with more bugs. Originally I'd downloaded an older version to avoid this but now that doesn't work and I'm about to have a breakdown over this update. I despise this and hope it gets changed back to the way it looked before.",2
com.discord,Saelath,"Great app. I use it mostly for gaming. Slower than most when transferring files or loading messages. Notifications are wonky - I don't always get them. Definitely room for improvement but the voice call and watch stream features, I rarely have an issue with. Also, it took me a while to learn how to navigate.",4
com.discord,ReclaimedDoor,"It's very good! I can post memes, chat during a game, and also use bots in servers! Edit: 3 years later, it kinda started to dig its own hole with the UI update. It brought a lot of bugs that weren't there before, and as of this writing, uploading files is bugged to where it thinks any file exceeds the file limit, even if it doesn't, essentially not allowing any files to be uploaded. Hope this bug is fixed soon, I still enjoy this app but its starting to show some neglect and troubles.",2
com.discord,cheetahquick9,"I absolutely love discord, but oh my word this new update was simply a downgrade. They UI is massive and cumbersome now, the text while typing is larger so even writing short messages fills up the screen and makes you have to scroll through your message, and it just looks so much worse than it was before updating. Honestly just go back to the old UI and all these problems would be solved. I never had a single issue with the old UI, so this was truly a step backwards.",1
com.discord,Makenzi Glass (Knight Of Void),"The latest update has caused some critical issues with this app. Messages containing more than one image refuse to send, and I have been consistently relocated to a random spot in one singular servers channels every time I relaunch the app. Also, this isn't recent, but the way the application handles in call audio causes major distortion no matter what you attempt to do, and this used to be something you could fix until an update a few years back. Desktop seems unaffected in comparison.",3
com.discord,Storm Hawke,"I love this app but the recent update is terrible. When I tap a notification, it goes to the last channel seen instead and only sometimes switches to the one with the notification after a significant lag. Messages don't automatically load consistently. I cannot hide my keyboard now, so it limits visible messages. Also new notification flyouts cover the menu and you can't do anything till they go away. Two months later, there's no improvement and now it keeps crashing and behaving erratically.",2
com.discord,Ashley Z,"Love Discord! Originally migrated over from Skype and have not regretted the decision once. Outages are short-lived and glitches are usually addressed promptly. I find the user interface to be clean and easy to navigate, and the ability to switch over to dark mode is always a plus. There are no ads plastered everywhere, and the Nitro subscription is optional (but very worth looking into!). If you're not sold on Discord, definitely give it a try and see how you feel. Wumpus needs more friends!",5
com.discord,David P,"It works for basic chatting, but recent updates have consistently broken everything media-related. Photos mostly work, but are sometimes bizarrely cropped. Any kind of animated media barely works at all, they mostly either blank out, refuse to play, or play stretched to a weird aspect ratio. Same for social media embeds. It's just been a mess for a while now.",2
com.discord,Canopus Wolph,"Update: New version now has the app hang when trying to send multiple photos or videos, then fail to send, entirely. Checking the reviews, it seems I'm not the only one with the problem. Being in IT myself, I've more than confirmed the issue isn't on my end. Video streams now stutter & look pixelated regardless of connection speeds between two users. Pre update they were crystal clear. Many, and more bugs that need squashing. Newest build ver. (148.14),: issues still persist.",1
com.discord,Tord ‚ÄúRed Leader‚Äù Larsson,"This is a great app for talking to my friends however, there are lots of bugs I cannot fix. 1st one is the time on mobile, it is ALWAYS 2 hours ahead of what I have set on my phone. I have tried changing my phone's settings to fix it, trying to hard reset discord, reinstalling discord. Things like that, and nothing seems to fix it. 2nd every time I send a message and then another one it adds a large gap and I have to scroll up and down to fix it. These are minor issues but just annoy me a lot.",3
com.discord,MonoRayJak,"Discord is a handy app on computers, but the mobile version is flooded with issues. Every update seems to break something new, and each thing broken seems to be different each time. The most recent update as of writing this review has destroyed any ability for me to send images on Android. I have tried on my home wifi, my school wifi, sending a large group of pictures, sending one picture, sending a picture from another location, sending the image from within the app. None of it works.",3
com.discord,Taylor Smith,"Mostly a desktop user, but pleased that the mobile app has generally had 95% of the same functionality. A few things are overly complex for the UI but that's a hard problem since they don't give you a ""neutered"" discord experience on mobile. Considered downgrading because my partner has consistent issues with losing audio in calls when the app isn't in the foreground, but it still seems like it might be some Samsung interference into audio access or battery saving features. Not sure.",5
com.discord,Alimorel Manx,Newest update makes me nauseous. The font sizing and shapes are different from section to section. The text box makes the font humongous then shrinks it down when you hit send. I feel like I'm going to be sick ü§¢. The new msgs on the top is way too big and gets in the way. Multiple times I've gotten dragged to some random other thing. Some of these changes should be rolled back or made optional settings at the very least. & it broke sending gifs. It hasn't been fixed in any updates. Yucky to use,1
com.discord,Anson Fear,"The app is great and the service discord provides is absolutely, well, vital to my lifestyle. It's much more efficient to communicate with friends and groups than any social media platform I've used, and the call quality is absolute great, even better than systems used for zoom and an upgrade from platforms like Skype. It's not perfect, there are technical bugs here and there that usually aren't a big distraction. I have not used the nitro subscription.",4
com.discord,adnaprellik,"This used to be a 4 star app. After recent updates, discord is pretty glitchy on mobile. For example, channels within servers randomly (and frequently) disappear. This is not an, ""Oops, I accidentally collapsed this channel category!"" issue. All or just some channels will completely disappear. Sometimes they will re-populate when I swipe around or exit and re-enter a server; however, I typically have to close the app and restart it.",3
com.discord,Andy Shoemaker,"This is a great app for texting and this is the only way me and my girlfriend can actively communicate. The thing is, the video chats keep lagging and freezing no matter the wifi or network connection we use. Sometimes under great network connection, it will say I have no service while all my other apps work. It keeps crashing any time I go to see a chat while in a call. I have done everything since the latest updates to fix it. Nothing has changed.",2
com.discord,Connor Hilpert,"I use it all the time and it works but my biggest complaint is that every update seems to fix one issue and create another. For instance right now the problem is that when I full screen a video call, every 20 seconds the video stops and is stuck on a frame but I can still hear the person I'm calling with. The only fix I've found is closing out of full screen and reopening but it just freezes again after 20 seconds.",4
com.discord,Dale Johnson,"Voice quality and the like are average, limits on file size for images are too low, and it only has basic voice options and controls compared to TeamSpeak, but cramming all of it into a single app that can also be used to socialize, and now with an easy way to add forums to your server (kinda, plus I haven't used it yet) is a great combo to have. You can pay to get around some of my complaints, but only on a per user basis. It'd be better if it was included for everyone on boosted servers",4
com.discord,Artist Oblivion,"Ever since the most recent mobile layout update, things have become almost unmanageable. If this app wasn't my only source of communication for many of my friends, I would uninstall it. The new UI is ugly, I cannot send more than one attachment at a time without the message being stuck at 0% processing, and the entire experience has become so much clunkier.",1
com.discord,Mary Early,"EDIT 9/13/22: Like many others have stated, this app has gone completely downhill after the latest update. Never in the past 5 years of using this app have I found myself having so many issues. From needing to restart the app once every 10 minutes because images will not load to the app getting stuck on the ""connecting"" loading message, this most recent update is a disaster. And that's just 2 of many issues. || 6/4/20: Best messaging app out there! I use it every day!",2
com.discord,Adam Suddon,Really great overall. A core reason why my friend group was able to stay tight over the last few years. Recent updates made things more difficult and there were a few weird bugs that have been getting ironed out. I would like more formatting options when using android's share function from another app to a discord post. That's something that's been reduced to a small single lined text box during a recent update.,4
com.discord,Jacque Champagne,"The last update simply broke the app for chromebook users. Since I was unable to watch videos, I though maybe updating it would help with the issue, well as it turns out, you not only didn't fix this but you also created more problems. So now, I can't watch videos, the formatting is uncomfortable, sending files (videos and pictures) has never been both so broken and so over complicated. The images get cut off and I get a lag spike whenever there is a gif or picture on the screen.",1
com.discord,kitty dragon52,"(I have an android) before this recent update I was happy with how my discord worked but one day I opened the app and suddenly it was unusable, forcing me to update to the newest version. Now when I open the app it takes forever to load, freezes constantly, my keyboard gets stuck on the screen, and being in a call is unbearable. I've been trying to turn off the push sounds but it seems like you cant. I'm very sound sensitive and liked how silent the app was before.",3
com.discord,ZackAttack_5,Good app. Does what it's supposed to do and is easy enough to use. Bugs are pretty rare but they're usually pretty entertaining when they do show up. Most videos I send from my phone have the audio wrecked and all you hear is incredibly loud white noise. I should also point out this is my only issue of this sort in the 5 years I've used discord.,5
com.discord,Alissa Hall,"Editing my review from 2 to 4 stars because I was able to solve the problem I had. Discord is a pretty good app. I can't say that it was as great as it used to be, since after the August update it's noticably slower in proformance, but it does its job. I don't really like where the call buttons are in DMs. I feel like at any moment I could accidentally call someone. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.",4
com.discord,Benjamin Greenwood,"A great place to get together with friends to hang out in video/voice calls, play games and stream movies/TV shows. I've made so many friends on this app and it's been an invaluable means of keeping in touch with people over long distances, especially during lockdown. But, it can be a bit confusing or overwhelming for people unversed in platforms like these. It isn't exactly a social media app like Instagram or Telegram even if it is certainly used like one.",5
com.discord,Laina Pup,"The app was great until the new update for Android. I hate it. It ruined the way fonts look for me, gave the entire app an unneeded jolt, and long or generally small images are practically unviewable now. My screenshots are all messed up, and you can't zoom in easily like you used to. It'd be great if we had an update where we could choose which version of the app layout we'd rather be on, because I'm currently having unneeded sensory panic. If you haven't updated, DON'T. It's for the better.",2
com.discord,mikaylarae locus,"I've been using this app for years now with almost no problems but only recently decided to download the mobile version. I literally CAN'T USE IT.

I LITERALLY CANNOT PRESS IT.",2
com.discord,Wyyverns,"I love what discord offers as a platform, but their mobile app keeps getting more annoying to use with every update. They've changed the feel of the app three times in what feels like less than a year, each time making it worse and harder to navigate. I will keep using it and wishing for it to get better because I have no other choice, but it sucks to suffer from unnecessary change.",2
com.discord,Teddy E.,"I usually love using discord to communicate with friends and family, but some of the most recent update changes have messed things up. The spacing between shared links and typed text is terrible, I can't easily link in chats via other apps, and for some reason when I get to the most recent chat post it doesn't update to get rid of the notification. I also can't turn off the link scan, which is highly inconvenient.",1
com.discord,J. White,"My friends and I use this app literally every day! I use it for D&D, video game comms, collaborative projects, and meeting new people! One of the only features I wish for is a noise-canceling slider; while trying to make sound effects my voice is often lost, perceived as background noise on the app lol But if you're looking for a great cross-compatible communication app, then oh yeah, you've found it.",5
com.discord,Aurora Ortega,"Before the recent updates, discord mobile was doing great. Messages would send, images would load AND compressed images would actually send unlike now. Even voice calls are annoying, video chat as well! There's too many new buttons and things added that its difficult to find what you're looking for. It's a bit disorganized for me, it looks like you guys crammed so much together. Discord also occasionally crashes randomly and it's frustrating.",1
com.discord,L.M. Allen,"The premium option for this app is affordable and worth it, and the free option is just as useful within its limitations. In the years since I downloaded Discord, I've found streamlined communications with friends over multiple servers, in multiple chats, and in voice and video chat. I haven‚Äôt had a single problem caused by a glitch. Everything is easy to navigate. It's all housed within a few pages, no features are truly hidden. And it all comes with a healthy layer of anonymity.",5
com.discord,Gakupo's Peacock (Mimi),"Before the big update, i do not like how the state app is currently is. It used to be smooth and connections were smooth but now i have issues reconnecting into the app, never had that problem before the big update. The format of text is smaller and the photo selection is more limited than before. When rereading old messages it doesn't stay in place, if there was an option to go back before the update or make huge improvements to make discord how it was before, I'll be greatful.",2
com.discord,BioResidentSKG,"Keeps crashing, can't even type before someone makes a comment or a notification pops up that instantly stops the entire app and having you to go back and retype everything. And for some reason when I open the app back up, text that I already sent magically re appear in the text box. This was fixed before but came back, and it's annoying. The app was perfectly fine before this and was a great app to chat with, still is. But these returning problems are ruining my experience.",1
com.discord,Alex Smith,"I finally discovered that the new discord update works with my phone, and as such I updated. So far it has been an ok experience. Still getting used to the UI differences, but there are also plenty of glitches still. Overall this is hopefully a better move to ensure no split attention between discord builds, and thus eliminate bugs. But until then I suppose I am stuck having to scroll down over and over as it resets my scroll progress.",3
com.discord,Novangst Media,"I love discord, but as soon as the latest update came out, I've only had problems. Rhe app, stored on my SD card (which has never been a problem), duplicated. One app didn't work, the other didn't stay opened. I closed the apps and uninstalled, but the icons stayed. No other app had this issue. Even then, the lag is ridiculous. Its impossible for me to type and hit send as it lags and takes extra time. Photos on bots delete, and take ages to re-add, only to delete again. So many othe issues too.",2
com.discord,Leonard Pryde,"Literally can't do anything when in call with someone. If you're in a call, it lags and freezes. If you're in a public vc, same issue. If you're doing literally anything on this new version that literally no one asked for, it freezes. Further issues include tapping messages leads to a jump in scrolling, video channels lagging more than before, events not showing, notifications and calls not going through in dms, and overall stuttering or slow response times which can be frustrating when frequent",1
com.discord,Sohom Das,"the new UI update is buggy and annoying. when you long press on a message, sometimes the popup pops up with a vibration, sometimes it doesn't vibrate but it still pops up, and sometimes it doesn't pop up at all. I like that discord's trying to make their UI more fun to use with animations and other things that the previous update didn't have, but it isn't perfect",3
com.discord,Kari Li,"I managed to get the email changed after some hassle. This isn't a bad app overall, but I feel like some ""ease of use"" concepts get overlooked? I suppose if you do run into problems contact support. It's at least pretty quick from my experience. Hoping they add a feature to opt to send verifications to email OR phone number in the future, just because my email gets real finicky.",3
com.discord,Cameron [„Ç≠„É£„É°„É≠„É≥],"The app was great for a long time. The first update of the new UI was more or less fine for me, despite it being kinda buggy. This latest update has had several bigger bugs that come up. Image thumbnails missing horizontal limits and run off the screen. A black section covering the bottom of the list of channels in my servers making many of them unaccessible. Discord really needs to get this new UI working as well as the old one before releasing it to us in this Alpha state.",1
com.discord,DJ Stomp (Salvo),"In the past month or so, the performance has worsened so severely that Discord has gone from being my favorite app, to the most frustrating app on my phone. It crashes every 30-60 seconds, and every time I update it just gets worse and worse. Devs, whatever you're doing lately, it's not working. Please stop breaking discord, if you really want to change it that much, make a new, seperate version so the rest of us who liked it just the way it was can still use it. Please?",2
com.discord,Vincent T,"Updated to the latest version and it's been an annoying app to use for the last month or so. Media including videos, images, gifs all act glitchy when using the app, Discord always has trouble connecting and loading chats as well. UI could've stayed the same if it meant the app functioned as it did just a few months ago. They've released several updates since then however none of them are solving the issues. Y'all might as well roll back. Not cool Discord. I pay for this app too.",2
com.discord,Scuderia Doggo,"The app back then before the updates were excellent and was done fine. I can upload videos n pictures with ease without it sending me to another tab. Lastly, the format was fine and well done. The new update however is broken. It takes so long to upload the pictures and such. Clicking on pictures is a pain because it sends me to another screen instead of showing me in the discord app. It always lagged so badly to the point it becomes unusable at times. Discord, please fix this.",2
com.discord,Andrew Savage,"Ever since the update the app barely works. Slows when typing, can't upload more than 1 file at a time, no matter how small, and even then it can take a full 60 seconds. Not the wifi. Every other app works perfectly, wifi is fantastic, and it's uploading to server no problem, but then it just says processing for a minute or forever and just vanishes without sending. Just use the desktop version. App is trash now. Also the Bluetooth recognition is God awful now for voice chat, don't know why",1
com.discord,Harris,"Discovered the issue with changing profile pictures. Pixel phones seem to like to save images as .webp files but displays them in the gallery as image files. Another issue I've encountered on my Pixel phone is that if I try to send a collection of images, usually between 6 and 10, it will tell me that the attachment data couldn't be found, even though it's under the 8MB file limit, so I'll have to go back and send each one individually.",4
com.discord,Ray,"Before the most recent updates (I think the last 2) this was a great app. Now it's genuinely, barely usable. It's laggy, crashes often, there are so many little bugs that end up making the experience of using this app, miserable. It was great before. I don't understand why you needed to change something what was fine and fixing the bugs that it had, instead of completely breaking it.",1
com.discord,ChibiLuka ChibiDuo,"I was enjoying the new update, the app was running smoothly. Then I was in a call one day and suddenly it dropped. I thought it was my net so I closed the app, but ever since it loops on load. I cleared the cache and data and still no luck, it loads on loop at the log in. The only way to fix this is to completely uninstall and reinstall. I've had to do this every time it ends up in a loading loop and restarting my phone does not fix the issue.",2
com.discord,Liam Waddleton,"Amazing app with everything I could want in it. Great way for me to communicate with friends. User interface is well designed, and the app has never crashed on me. Update notes are not only easy to read, but fun to read in many cases. I especially like how, in recent years, the PC version of the app will let you directly invite people through discord to join a game, like Halo Infinite or Borderlands 3. The app barely uses any of my phone's battery, and I've never seen it glitch out.",5
com.discord,Terabyte,"The app has been making a ton of changes lately to it's UI and it's not really for the best. Being no longer able to zoom in, photos and gifs take longer to load. In some servers like art galleries, gif finders and even just normal servers the app will crash without fail if don't turn off animations. Please revert some of these if possible and do better. I know you can.",2
com.discord,Random Wolf,"Communications app to connect with friends, family, creators and more. Discord had recently fixed the echo within calls but now when ever you use it on the phone. The call will not receive your voice at all so you must keep the screen active at all times. It was a struggle especially when gaming. Tapping the screen everytime it is about to fade into black.",4
com.discord,Addy,"The new layout and text is hideous. Also, I hate that you can't see exact timestamps on older messages anymore. What if I want to know the hour something was sent? Stupid. Updating with more issues as I've been unfortunately cursed to use the new version: - Whenever I open the app, it loads in light mode sometimes even though I have dark mode turned on. - Whenever I try uploading a new profile picture, some images give me an error and refuse to go through. ""No image data,"" or w/e.",1
com.discord,OreoEatingHusky,"Discord itself is a great thing. The mobile app, at least on android, is NOT. I have had increasing issues in the past two months of messages not sending, channels not opening and general connection to the app. This happens on both my data and my wifi. It is extremely frustrating to me. I still recommend the app but as of this review the app is trash.",1
com.discord,Bea Butter,"Discord was great before this update. Ran like a dream, usable UI, never any complaints. High quality chat app. Now, the app crashes (literally never before), the UI changes I might otherwise be able to get over- cramped channel view, keyboard not showing up for emoji or gif search, pulse feedback when I open or close a server folder, mismatched font sizes- are maddening, on top of myriad loading issues mean I just wish I could revert. I would do an awful lot for an option to do so.",2
com.discord,Seth L.,"The app has definitely gotten better and a lot less glitchy since my review of it in September. However now pretty much nothing related to media (emojis, profile pictures, images/videos sent to chat) will load. I have bad internet and I expect it to sometimes be slow but this is just ridiculous. I've never had it be anywhere near this bad prior to the UI update. App isn't completely broken anymore so it gets two stars instead of one but this issue still makes the app unusable. Please fix.",2
com.discord,sarcastic McSpastic,"This was probably one of the most stable, reliable, and transformative apps on the market for Android as a platform. I've made friends on it, I hoast events over it, and it's slowly made it's way into being an essential part of any modderaltey tech-savvy persons software toolkit That being said, recent updates have made this app one of the most unstable applications on the android market, featuring frequent crashes when trying to play or open video files now, and constant random bugs and hiccups",2

Several updates later and the issues are still there, still can't see when others are talking, the overlay is still bugged out. Please fix this. (Updated)",1
com.discord,Evaline Rose (Twilight's Melody),So the new update has made Discord on my phone practically unusable. When I click on something it takes longer to load or switch servers. If I'm on a channel when it gets a new message I have to mark as read or change channels and change back. Can't download images from it even after giving it all permissions in settings. And the channels and font size are way too compact it makes reading hard and trying to turn it up makes it too large.,1
com.discord,Leo Davis,"A few issues have been fixed such as the text zoom from what I have seen before the update but I still have express dissatisfaction. I would rate this 5 stars if it wasn't for the new Android update. It reset all my settings, the channels are way too close, and it is even more obvious who I have blocked has texted. Other than that, pretty cool. (Edit: I change this from 5 to 4 stars because of the new image UI. (Edit 2. Manually jump to messages. 3/5",3
com.discord,Dustin Alday,The new update has caused so many issues for me. The UI is terrible and looks bad. Gif don't show up nor do some pictures it's just black even if you tap on it just pulls up a black screen. The text is so small and adjusting it makes everything off. You can't even mark all as read without going through menues now. Plus everything is now lagging for no reason. This is just terrible and bad. Update: These issues are still here. And after last night's update it's constantly crashing.,1
com.discord,Tnomic Vierling,"Recent update seems to have disabled older builds, forcing use of a clunky, poor performance, inferior UI version. The older version was fine as it was. It worked as it should unlike now. Something as simple as swiping to the right bring up the server bar and left to close it no longer exists in this version. How can this be so lacking? bringing up server options shows a small portrait sized window which looks like a misuse of space. Surprise, the image sharing UI is broken in landscape.",1
com.discord,Carter ‚ÄúMuhammad Razavi‚Äù Nance,"This new update is absolutely horrid. Y'all really sat down and said ""Yo, how can we just ruin our app and make it a chore to use."" It was perfectly good before, you just changed it for the sake of change, and you made the app terrible. It's clunky, my vc audio cuts out, freezes constantly, my keyboard slows when typing, the entire voice and video chat system breaks as soon as you leave the app, other people's cameras glitch off screen constantly, it's slow, and doesn't feel fluid anymore.",1
com.discord,Leana Yomeiri,"The update has ruined functionality. I can't send multiple photos or take a photo in app. It reloads the entire app any time I switch between apps.

The mobile app seems to actually be slightly more stable than the desktop app, I enjoy all the features and ease of use.

com.discord,Booshie,"I will never understand why you have to pay to send higher quality images or videos, let alone stream in a higher quality. Many other apps have those features for free and frankly are easier to use with the new update they gave it. Being an artist is beyond hard when sending clients low resolution images or videos. It's quite sad, really. Please remove the lock on sending higher quality images and I might change my rating.",2
com.discord,xPjot,"Horrible new update. It is incredibly slower than before and takes so much longer to just simply load a channel. I can't click on any videos from my friends (especially Twitter links) because it'll either just be a black screen, load really slow, or just crash my app. Videos are also much easier to accidentally click which makes it even more likely to crash and lag trying to navigate through channels and servers. Fix please",2
com.discord,Chris Thomas,"The user interface was not obvious to navigate at first, however using the app for 30 min is enough get the gist of it. Additionally, closing the app does not ""hang up"" from a voice chat, which required a minor adjustment. After those lessons are learned, the value of the app is extraordinary.",5
com.discord,Spencer Black,"Listen. Actually do something right for a change. Every update you've rolled out has made this app worse and worse. I'm not done, keep reading. The app is slow, half the time it won't let me type, messages sometime fail to appear for minutes on end, it crashes frequently, and videos don't load half the time. LISTEN!!! Rollback to the Android version please. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY likes this update. It's been months, and you can't take a hint. Don't give me an automated message, just fix it.",1
com.discord,Alesia Green,"The app is rather buggy a lot of times and it would seem that even sharing basic videos is too much to ask from an app. Honestly have tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times just to see if it would run normally. A lot of basic features for literally any texting app are rather reserved for people who can afford $9.99usd a month. Don't get me wrong, it's a good app to mess with friends and stuff on. Still have friends who text me and say that they might not text because hackers.",2
com.discord,Justin D,"This app used to be fine, but has gotten MISERABLE out of nowhere. The limit for sending files is 8MB. It tells me I cannot send a video that's 4.20MB because it's ""too big"". Every video I send (still under 8MB) is horribly compressed, despite not going over the size limit. Videos sometimes just don't play unless I close and restart the app. This app has been getting absolutely terrible with each update. I would rate this 0 stars if possible.",1

Before the update, everything was okay and wasn't breaking. Now, videos won't play sometimes and I have to restart discord because every now and then, I get put in a ""Connecting..."" loop, where it ""connects"" for forever.

com.discord,Smash Bro,"Fundamentally broken. Decided to finally update after hearing the horror stories about porting the iOS version had mostly went away... and it turns out, they haven't. Uploads of multiple files, even small images, will seemingly hang forever and never actually finish, though uploading the exact same files one-at-a-time is near instantaneous.

com.discord,Laiba Ali,"As an aspiring UX designer, I have to say - Discord is a VERY friendly app. From ease of use, organization, and server control options, it's the perfect way to connect with friends, be aware of events, or even just organize your own thoughts. There are a few bugs here or there (recently I've had some trouble tapping+holding messages to react or respond to them) but they are always being fixed and improved upon. Succinctly put: I'm very fond of Discord!",5
com.discord,Cat Rose,"I love the layout of this app and the privacy features. My one complaint is the quality of calls. The audio tends to be glitchy, especially on laptops (echos, cutting out, and other weird noises) The video quality can also be glitchy and tends to freeze. Another complaint I have is the compression of files although I understand the hassle to have premium features since Discord has no ads. I'd say the app can be mildly inconvenient at worst. Messages send much faster than most other apps as well.",4
com.discord,F. A. MURPHY,"Well, I've created some very wonderful and...interesting things. There are still a few bugs that need work. Certain styles give weird results.

I do love the fact you can now have a stream pop-out so you can message instead of exiting to message. Other than that, it's alright, would love to see Discord optimized though.",3
com.discord,Lucy Christine,"An absolute cesspool 10/10 No but in reality, I use this to text with my long distance friend.

It's like another part of my life at this point and I wouldn't want to do without it. That being said, their updates are really breaking their own system. But to their credit, a lot of what has broke has been fixed. But there are still a large number of UI bugs compared to it's old system. And questionable UI designs.",3

A gif was posted in the last channel I was in and it's endlessly crashing every time I open the app. Outside of the bug from the latest update, I hate the new design that they've gone with. Scrolling through text channels feels awful for landscape, it feels like you need to make a perfect swipe down or up otherwise the info bar on the right is going to try to pop out, which is very disruptive.",1
com.discord,Ashlyn T.,"I've used discord for a long time and I've had very few issues with it. However, I find it extremely inconvenient that Nitro can't be managed on mobile devices.

But the app itself and ability to build within it is easy enough to learn and manage. Participating in servers is usually user friendly. Overall love the app.,4
com.discord,trever clark,I love discord and I've used it for years but after I was forced to update it I've realized this new update is terrible. Discord freezes all the time and crashes when I try to send videos or open certain servers. My gallery has been looping as well when I scroll for some odd reasons as well. I preferred the older version and I hope that if this new UI is kept that they continue to improve it because it's barely usable in it's current state.,2
com.discord,Trev Rey,"The app overall has been great but recently there's been some really troubling issues with half of the channels just disappearing, things taking forever to load, and my connection just flat out not working regardless of how long I leave it on and all of this seemed to have a massive spike with both the lag and the connection issues after the latest update. If it gets fixed I'll change my rating but till then it's a very big issue for me.",3
com.discord,Ethan Mills,"The app itself is fine, honestly one of the best communication apps I've ever used, however as of late, me and a couple of friends have had this issue where video files just have their audio completely replaced with an extremely harsh and loud static sound. It's not the end of the world but it's still extremely annoying as one friend of mine has been having this problem for months while I have just recently started to.",3
com.discord,Lakek,"Remove the newest overhaul, it doesn't make things easier and makes it significantly harder to navigate, especially with how quickly it throws you into a vcs text chat making it hard to even exit those screens. The text is now too large to the degree I can't read it too, and the scaling doesn't fix it since it's the actual icon/dm title text. Laggy to the point I've had to reset my phone three times as well, and it's hard to leave call when the VC is below everything bc of how the notifs changed",1
com.discord,Xana The Dark,"Functions enough on a base level but they completely broke the push to talk feature for voice chats. Sometimes it toggles like it should, and sometimes it stays on permanently after a single tap of the button. They also changed it to make a noise play when you tap the button which results in the other people in the chat hearing that noise everytime you try to speak, not sure why anyone would think that's a good idea.",2
com.discord,Tyler Poulin,"Not being able to share videos FOR TWO STRAIGHT WEEKS since the last update because Discord hangs at ""compressing files"" every time is pretty lame. Really scrolling up dozens of posts in the chat for no reason is annoying. Not following the text cursor when typing, forcing me to scroll down to see what I'm typing, which then - for reasons unknown - causes the text cursor to move to the end of the previous line is basically cancer. Don't roll out updates if you haven't tested them.",1
com.discord,Max McNabb,"it's a game that I've been playing for years at this point, and i recently switched from iphone to samsung. whenever i have bluetooth headphones on while joining game that has vc, the audio output goes to my phone. Ive been looking for a solution for this problem, but I've been unsuccessful. I'd really like to find a way to fix it, or if it's a bug on roblox's end",3
com.discord,Sam Jones,"The latest update changed the font style for usernames/nicknames, made the text smaller, and put all the channels closer together. It's a lot less accessible if you have any kind of vision issues since everything is now smaller, closer together, and harder to distinguish. Also the app keeps crashing and failing to load images/texts.",3
com.discord,Jathan Martin (Arthur Ritis),"Super laggy, message links don't work 90% of the time, videos/photos dont upload half the time after compressing especially if theres more than one at a time, and compression is counter-intuitive. Ill send a 3MB video and it compresses it to make it 8MB, seems kinda backwards right? Videos turn to static, crashes doing anything (opening profiles, going to settings). Discord has a simple purpose and can't even do it right.",1
com.discord,NovaTheEnby,"Updated my app last night and messages no longer send/delete smoothly. Please fix this bug, it's very rough on the eyes. I've preferred discord mobile for years because the smooth movements were easier to look at on screen and now they're glitching and are gone. I can't find anything to fix it in settings. I also can't disable bold names or make the message box smaller. Message display margins broke too and they are now shown further apart than they're supposed to be. Discord is usually great.",1
com.discord,Branden Ong,"Worked fine when I had an Apple device, but now that I'm using an Android I've been riddled with issues with the app. Video calls freeze, no exaggeration, every 10-15 seconds, forcing me to exit out of fullscreen and reenter back in so that it unfreezes. And most recently, I can't even see the tabs at the bottom which allow me to go to my friends list or settings. Very unhappy with this and it makes me wonder if Discord employees have Android users at all.",1
com.discord,Jonah Jeleniewski,"Since the switch to react native, the experience has been horrid. It's visually uglier than the native app. The UX feel is jankier than the native app. You launch the app or switch back into it and are immediately greeted with ""Connecting..."" and a shameful laggy load of recent chats. Sometimes the aforementioned ""Connecting..."" decides to just never ""connect"" despite being on strong WiFi. The list goes on.",1
com.discord,Morgan Zamzow,This review is to reflect the latest update. THE APP IS BARELY USABLE RIGHT NOW. Any time I minimize the app I need to hard restart it to use it upon maximization. It is so unstable and crashes very frequently. I am on the latest version of the app and android. Over the past couple weeks I've just watched these issues get worse. I'm not sure who asked for this or thought this overhaul was a good idea but it feels like a massive step backwards. Profiles look strangely zoomed in when previewing.,1
com.discord,Stahp,"Constantly having problems with this version. And not just the annoying ""connecting"" issue where the app refuses to work and had to be closed and reopened. Many times I'll type a response, send, it appears to post, then I find out later that discord ate my messages. ALSO, nearly all the buttons/icons/emojis/status dots/anything that is a graphic is not displaying. I've tried restarting the app, force stop + clearing the cache, and restarting my phone, but so far nothing has helped. üíÄüíÄüíÄ",1
com.discord,Rachel White,"Good app for big group/team communications. Allows for different channels with different permissions to help ease control of content. It's not the most intuitive for those managing channels though. As a captain on a club team I often needed to create new channels, assign roles, post announcements, etc. and this was not always easy to get the right people to see the right info with the right permissions. However, overall pretty good app. Will continue to use it. Custom emojis are pretty fun.",4
com.discord,Nate Robertson,"Not sure what happened recently but the app has been performing terribly. Failing to connect is the primary issue on my end, waiting for minutes at a time as the app simply states ""Connecting..."". Two stars because once it finally connects it's not so bad, but still seems to struggle with performance.",2
com.discord,J√§ger Bomb,"4-5‚ú®Ô∏è I've been a happy camper on discord since 2018, thankfully ive had little to no issues. But the most recent update has brought quite a few. I tried trouble shooting it myself but my main issue is that, when I'm on a video call, the videos from others in the call freeze or won't load every 30 to 60 seconds. I can usually the videos back if I minimize the call.",4
com.discord,Crystal Hay,"New update constantly crashes on mobile, and I get notifications only half of the time. I unintentionally ghost people because I just never get a notification from them. The crashing is multiple times a day and there's no option to send a report. Pressing down on messages to react to them is also acting weird, too. Very annoying and would love to see a fix to these. Edit to my review: Updated the app like they said to do and even reinstalled it. Still crashes.",1
com.discord,alpha wolf,"the new layout looks amazing! but it sort of broke the app for me. Channel names will be either completely gone or the words will be out of place, and its really slow for some reason? it isn't my phone. this has never happened before while using the app. it's most definitely because of the update. it will freeze while im trying to type or trying to switch between servers and stuff.",3
com.discord,Sashkin Pashkin,"After the major overhaul back in early September or late August, everything has been consderably worse in quality. I cant send multiple photos at once anymore, even with super duper fast internet! It just breaks and doesnt send. My stream quality is super bad and only runs at like 2 fps, which is again not the fault of my device(s) or my internet. Ive said this once and Ill say it again, dont reinvent the wheel, it was perfect before the overhaul, please go back to the older version.",1
com.discord,Sabo (8l172),"Not sure what they did to the app but it is awful to use now. It takes around 4-6 minuted to load into a single server/group chat/DM because you get stuck at the ""Connecting..."" Message at the top; Sending photos is even worse as you have to press the send button at least 3 times to get it to send, and even then it usually crashes the app (same issue happens with sending nornal text messagws but it hasn't crashed me, yet). Edit: Now I can't see peoples names or online status as its stoll bugged.",2
com.discord,Devastator325,"Way worse ever since the early August update, took two months to go back to the old image system that worked perfectly fine. Discord is a prime example of incompetent developers breaking things that worked perfectly fine before, or changing things that didn't need to be messed with, and this time it seems to be just because they were lazy, and didn't want to work on two separate codebases for IOS and Android respectively. They still compress mobile images with the option for that turned off",1
com.discord,Kylee Cameron,"My review was 5 stars for years. Now I feel generous giving 3. Since the last big update, Discord does not work properly. At least twice a day, Discord will say it has lost connection for no apparent reason and it takes its good ol time reconnecting. The search feature no longer works at all. As a moderator this has made things 10x more difficult. For voice and video, setting output to default doesn't do anything. I have to manually change it every time. Tldr; do better.",3
com.discord,Coyotezzz,"Gif-finder, upload gallery, video watching all unusable due to lag. Sometimes attempting to download an image doesn't work. Easy to get flooded with notifications. Clearing pings takes too long. Emoji sorting system is counterintuitive. Impossible to tell server folders apart. Text size and spacing is atrocious, zoom function doesn't help. Features irrelevant to me are unhidable. Only reason I'm still using this is because Discord is essential to my life and older APKs are now broken.",1
com.discord,S. Quinn,"This is the best app for everything from small chat servers with friends to big public servers. Voice is clear and easy on the data, and you can smoothly move from using it on your phone to using it on your computer. The only thing I don't like is that it's a little kludgy if you want to re-share an image or gif that has been shared in Discord, because it gets turned into a Discord link, but it's not hard to work around that.",5
com.discord,Grey Cruz,Love the app but the newest update sucks. The font is too small or too big no matter how many times I've tried to fix it. When messaging a friend it asks if you want to report them before the chat loads. My slide for photos doesn't even load well. Edit: Now another problem I have is that I can't even log on. It says that my email doesn't exist or the password/ email is wrong,3
com.discord,James Keo,"Whether it'd be from a recent update or not, the current UI is absolutely scuffed compared to the previous. Some functions, such as checking emote origins/descriptions/users, are missing. Text and voice channels go missing, or covered up past a certain point frequently. Things just aren't as functional as they were previously.",2
com.discord,Michael Renna,"Updating to version 147.16 ruined a lot of what I use Discord for, removing options and features for no apparent reason, namely image compression. Previous versions of the app let you turn that off in the settings, there are *videos* of people showing where that setting used to be. So since I can no longer change that (with it being turned on permanently,) I tried to cancel my nitro subscription. Thing is, you CAN'T DO THAT on the app anymore either! Why would that be removed??",1
com.discord,kiielmao,"before the recent update, everything was good and easy to navigate and use. Now, there are bugs that makes me frustrated. There's this thing where if I upload a funny video, the audio turns into static noises and it annoys me augh. that's the only thing that I want to be fixed right now, cus it's not very enjoyable.",2
com.discord,Chloe Taylor,"The newest update wiped my favorite emoji list so I had to redo that, and of course the app is slow and buggy right now. 11/14/22 Update: the app is still buggy and slow, and its the only app doing this. The keyboard takes 10 years to recognize my inputs, and when it does, its often incorrect inputs. I would give this app no stars if I could. The devs did not help me",1
com.discord,Faera Rathion,"I would've given this 5 stars a few months ago, being a long time user, but these recent updates have made the app extremely frustrating to use. I get randomly put into channels when I open the app, they scroll me back sometimes hundreds of messages, it's impossible to see all the channels in some Discords, doesn't clear notifications without having to try to fully scroll through a channel I was mentioned in to the point of having to refresh it multiple times and many more consistent issues.",1
com.discord,Thomas Angus,"Ever since an update they released about a year ago, the app has steadily become worse, and my opinion on the app has also decreased. The first bad update prevented me from watching 90% of the video files uploaded to the app. That was fixed, but only a few weeks later. Every update has had some sort of problem. One of the more recent ones creates a 50/50 chance the app will just not work, and I have to restart the app. For now, I give the app 2 stars until it is finally fixed.",2
com.discord,Avoxx Nepps,The new update has made it borderline unusable. It is extremely glitchy and a lot of times doesn't even work properly. Can't even join a voice call without it leaving and rejoining by itself or muting me for unknown reason. The new video system absolutely sucks. All of the minor inconveniences the previous version had is nothing compared to this update which looks like it was thrown together by a team of teenagers in Middle School in a month for a school project.,2
com.discord,Arthur Ford,"Entire UI was changed for the worse. There isn't any animation when receiving messages now. UI is much more laggy and some animations seem to not even support 120hz anymore. I enjoy the app for the most part, but would very much like to see some of these changes reverted or at least an option to revert them client side. I have since been prompted by the app to give a review even though these issues persist. I would like to see older features added back such as communication mode toggles.",1
com.discord,True Night's Edge,"I am having an issue where if I try to send more than 1 attachment at a time it will clear the first phase of it uploading, but then during the second phase it will freeze at around 2% and it won't send the attachments.

I can no longer save images, it gives me the ""Save failed, please check system network and privacy settings for photos app"" I have tried multiple solutions to this, including uninstalling and reinstalling. Still not",3
com.discord,Goodra,"The Discord app used to be great, but recently they've run it into the ground because they're trying to push Nitro subscriptions. My available photos don't update when I take pictures, half the time when I try to send a photo it rapidly selects and deselects the one I tap, the app forces my phone to mute and unmute when I open it while in a phone call even if I'm just in a text channel, the app frequently puts me in random DMs when I open it instead of the DM I was last in, and more. 0/10",1
com.discord,Daniel Kaspo,"Can no longer upload videos. I manually compressed my videos but now the app tries re-compressing them and they turn out 10x bigger (5mb turned into 50mb!!) This prevents me from uploading a lot of small video files! On top of that, everything feels like it animates and moves at 30fps when it previously was buttery smooth. Sharing things is such a hard thing to do. I can't edit the message well in the single text box for sharing. I'm avoiding the mobile app like the plague.",1
com.discord,Time Escaped,"I love this app because there is just SO much potential with it. I feel it's not necessarily the easiest to navigate due to the bot system but that's just about it. I think having a nice, little manual to always have access to would be helpful but overall a great app. Also could recommend a little bit of an easier system with trying to add friends since some people make it impossible to friend due to funny fonts in the usernames.",5
com.discord,Laster Caster,"Getting worse all the time. Thanks for firing your Android team, by the way. Your iOS team has really delivered an excellent challenge to those who need accessibility.

com.discord,Financial Professionals,"After the Oct 3 update, everything sucks. I can't upload more than one image at a time, the keyboard lags whenever I try to type more than 3 words, the media menu that comes up when you want to select media requires you to use your device's back button to get out of it, when before it had an easy little down arrow in-app, and when I scroll up to look at past messages and hit the arrow to return to the most recent one, it doesn't just snap there like it used to, it scrolls down, taking longer.",2
com.discord,Girlfriend FNF,"Discord overall is amazing, and I don't mind how PC users get more features [as it's easier to add to PC] but recently I've been having issues. Before the most recent update, Discord would randomly stop loading messages and I'd have to completely close out discord and re-open it to see new messages. That always worked, but was extremely annoying, so I checked for updates and updated it... now Discord won't even open no matter what I try.",3
com.discord,Orel,"I dont know what happened but the app has been terrible. Constant freezing, I can only send one image at a time and when I go into my gallery while in a call the whole app crashes but the call continues until I force stop it or try opening it like 10 times to no avail. I don't have these issues on PC, but the mobile is practically unusable.",2
com.discord,Sophie Harrison,"New font is horrendous. The old one is fine, there was no need to update it. It just looks like something that would come out of a word document, so I'm refusing to update discord until that font is either removed or can be changed. Also, there's so many bugs.

Unsure what could be causing the new issues, it is my main way to communicate with people so the lag is rather frustrating when trying to move between conversations.",1

Even aside from that, the app is complacent being a lackluster substitute for the (also worsening) desktop version, lacking extremely basic features (like copying text from statuses/bios ?), inconsostent performance for seemingly no reason, and needlessly complicated UI & settings that sometimes don't work, making it a pain to talk to friends with lives through no fault of their's, consistently. A shame",1
com.discord,Bradley Talley,"Issues that I have encountered in the last week: -Push notifications do not send when screen is locked -when pushes are sent, they are sent in bulk. Then when tapped, the app opens but the messages do not appear until app is restarted -when sending an image, new images do not update until the app is restarted -keyboard auto opens on dms, can type, but cursor is not on the text, can't backspace until the textbox is selected",2
com.discord,Tommy Walker,"I never had a problem with the app until the last month or so. Now I have channels that won't mark themselves as read after they've been viewed, server channel lists that don't populate until I scroll the list around, pictures that won't load, etc. It's not unusable, but given how high quality the app has been until recently, it's frustrating.",2
com.discord,Your chunky foot fungus,"Everything works pretty well! I haven't had any problems in voice calls and I can talk to my friends easily. Though when they or I send a video, I can't hear the audio; so I have to download the video and then I can hear the audio. I've checked my settings multiple times and my earbuds and speaker don't have anything wrong.",4
com.discord,Mary,"Everything works fine for the most part, except they took away the ability to add photos to the chat via your clipboard on mobile. That was the only way I could spoiler pictures. Now I can only send pictures if I go to my gallery, select the picture, click share, select Discord, then search for the channel I want to send it to (this option won't give me the option to spoiler pictures) Much more tedious than just saving a picture to your clipboard and adding it that way.",3
com.discord,Kuro,"The new UI is HORRIBLE. All text looks smaller, categories are closer together, the notifs at the top of the screen just float there *and* you can no longer save a notif by swiping down because that removes it now. I only didn't give one star because the platform still WORKS, I just wish I didn't have to use it now. EDIT : It ALSO reset my notification settings set by my phone settings for it, so I'm getting notifs from servers popping up on my screen. I've changed my mind about two stars.",1
com.discord,Eric Wood,"Almost perfect platform, I rairly have issues with discord and most of the time they are resolved quickly. The one issue I do run I to is when I try to upload a photo taken on a modern phone at 108MP I get a poop emoji on both the preview picture and the original when you click on it. Tried nitro and still have an issue. Also tried support and unfortunately they say it's a limitation. So remember to take a nice photo and a lesser quality photo if you think it will go onto discord.",4
com.discord,Christian Twichell,"I hate the new android update. It's slow, glitchy, I don't like that it doesn't save the specific time of messages. Can't send more than one file/image/gif, it begins sending but never loads or actually sends in. I dislike that you can't send videos because of the nitro subscription. I understand it, I just dislike that those who can't pay have much less freedom. But I do love the video chat screen shrinking and staying up when multitasking features. Its just not as smooth anymore. Please fix it",3
com.discord,Charles,"Absolute garbage on most recent update. It notifies you of messages in Android auto with no way to turn the notifications off, making android auto unusable with the stream of notifications . Any time you attempt to send multiple files in a single message it hangs after processing the first file. Notifications are completely unreliable. Terrible keyboard hangs and frame lag when scrolling are extremely aggravating. I find myself not talking to friends because the app is so terrible to use.",1
com.discord,Edward Lorrain,"Bad app, but everyone uses it :/ A lot of bugs on my end. Currently won't update attachments for long periods of time, making it annoying to send screenshots or photos to my friends. Each 'response' to this telling me to update the app just proves Discord doesn't care; either the response team doesn't care or is overworked by people who don't care. Cache builds up >1gb so fast; app slows down ridiculously.",1
com.discord,Willy Pete (Willy Pete),"Overall I like this app. The various levels and tools available for organization are phenomenal, the colors aren't hard on my eyes, and it's easy to navigate through the app. If I can't figure out how to use a stylized font like strikethrough it's easy to Google the commands or formatting I need.",4
com.discord,Tanky Crobat,"Newest update for October: the buttons for the call overlay is back again. On top of that, when flipping between inner screen and outer screen, it adjusts the app sizes nice. The last thing that could be fixed, and I don't know if this is a discord thing, but when I'm on discord call and switch to audio based social media like TikTok or YouTube, audio settings ""adjust"" microphone and speaker sounds just for being on the app. If that can get fixed. I'll give this a five star.",3
com.discord,Evan mortensen,"Notifications no longer swipe away the way they used to, DM pings show up as 2 notifications instead of one. Emotes don't always work when you hit them, and server switching is laggy and jarring. Sometimes the server members list pops up when trying to send a message. Unlike most I'm optimistic about the changes, but this definitely should have been tested and bug fixed before they switched the UI.",2
com.discord,"You Slumber, Cucumber","Android version used to be better before the update a lot of Android users talked about. Before, I had no problems. Now, there's moments where I have to flip my Wi-fi off and on to get chat to work. Usernames and profile pics are slow to update on servers, the file/image uploading menu is too small, doing something(?) causes the keyboard to pop up incessantly and requires closing and reopening the app to fix it, and overall things feels slower and glitcher than they did before the update.",3
com.discord,Peter Kelley,"Used this app for years but with the latest series of updates I am forced to use my computer. My device (Asus ZenPad) is an older one and after the changes it is highly unstable. Changing servers or channels too fast? Stops responding. Typing out more than 3 words? Stops responding. Browsing too long? Stops responding. It is virtually unusable in this state where I am constantly forced to use my devices ""power & boost"" function to free up ram in an effort to not crash. Old version was better",1
com.discord,ThatPinhead,"While I find most of the application usable, the issue lies in the fact that it cannot send images properly. I send an image to a channel or private conversation, and it sits in a ""queue"". The queue ""loads"" all the way, but the image doesnt send. Only when I turn my wifi off and turn on my cellular data, does the image send. Even then, I cannot send more than one image at a time. It is not a huge issue, but if it involves the programming of the app, please fix it to your earliest convenience.",3
com.discord,JustJack,"With the newest update to the mobile version of discord it has been an absolute nightmare. Random crashes, videos not playing sometimes requiring you to close and re-open the app, making sending media absolute hell with limiting how low you can scroll and how it consistently resizes the attach file menu. I have no clue why you ever decided to change anything, in my honest opinion the old version we had was perfect, no bugging issues the layout was fine I could stuff freely. Anyway. please fix-it",1
com.discord,Nicholas Brown,"Great, I just hit the update button and am deeply regretting it. It's extremly laggy now and prone to crashing on my device, likely because it's an older one. I wish you guys were considerate of people with less powerful devices, but I know I'm just shouting in the dark with that comment. Edit: Wow, on top of all that, now any videos I send, the audio just corrupts into what sounds like extremely loud static. Edit 2: Actually posted a bug report before the devs answ. we'll see if it gets fixed.",2
com.discord,PandaMonium,Every time I try and use my phones camera to live stream myself the video freezes after a few minutes and then the screen just goes black with a loading symbol. I can still hear everything but can't see anything. This is only a problem on mobile. It happens to myself and two of my discord friends. Anytime I use pc I never have an issue. Please fix its been this way ever since the new update!,2
com.discord,Joe McKenzie,"Continued adventures in the new non-native version: Call ringing sound played through my Bluetooth headset, but when I answered the other person's voice played loudly through the phone speaker! I hung up, disconnected and reconnected the headset. Then I rejoined and it worked properly. When we both hung up, the green ""connected"" bar at the top remained. I repeatedly tap the hang up button but nothing happens. Other person comes back and it plays through the phone speaker. Output device select???",1
com.discord,Morx Da Grape,"Redoing for the current update: It's improved since my last review, but the push notifs tend to not work. The app is still generally sluggish compared to the versions before the UI change. Also still some bugs. To touch back on the push notif issue, they worked before the UI change. I dunno what was changed for them to just not work, but it's a little annoying to not know when a friend replied to me.",2
com.discord,TJ Wilson,"Discord is an app I use very frequently whether it is on my PC or on my phone to keep in contact with communities and friends. For the app, I've enjoyed the features quite a bit and it is a really good mobile companion app. The only thing keeping this rating from a perfect score is that the voice chat functions can be ""hit or miss"". Other than that, great app!",4
com.discord,Zenixark,"I cannot fathom how awful the quality of this app has become, desktop and mobile... imagine a place, where instead of adding any useful or highly-asked-for features for server owners, they add endless amounts of bugs, crashes, errors, there is no escape. This genuinely may be the buggiest app I have ever seen, and don't even get me started on the desktop versions bugs... it's like the devs just gave up on the integrity of their service and only cares to add 1 feature (mostly nitro only) a year..",1
com.discord,"Nebulous Seriphim, Paranoid Obelisk",Fix the update please. It's still so so so bad. I can't send images and I'm an artist hahaha. I've been on discord on the old format pre update until it couldn't support it anymore. Now I'm updated again and it's so awful. Why did you update it? None of the changes are useful. Everything is annoying. As a wall text typer the red number limits are actually worse. Trying to use certain features crashes the app. Some things are way to small now and don't change with size adjustments.,1
com.discord,Nikita Ficklin,I love discord it's great for socializing and making friends however I HATE the last update it did seemingly nothing exept make things harder for me. One of my servers has a ton of categories and tons of channels within each one and the categories keep dissappearing and I keep having to remake them and put the channels back where they belong. This is where the update makes things difficult. After the update it got harder to move the channels around so it's nearly impossible to fix things.,2

This app has been completely destroyed and is almost totally non-functional at this point.",1
com.discord,Seth CH,"Since the new update, a few things have been fixed but I still have some issues. Images are still compressed and and load weird, same with GIF's. Sometimes my messages won't send at all despite having a strong wifi signal, sometimes they don't even show up, even tho I know I entered a message and sent it. Audio calls are weird and sometimes it won't let me mute and unmute at all. Also message requests They're great and all but I don't get notified for them, please fix this.",1
com.discord,Lumsy A,"The recent upgrade made this app unusable unless I'm on wifi. It just hangs and keep saying Connecting. Useless when I'm away from home which is not good. I need to use it daily and frrquently when I'm out and about. We need to have this bug fixed ASAP. I thought it was something wrong with my phone, I called my carrier and troubleshoot for a while still nothing. I removed several apps on my phone just to free up tons of space thinking it was a storage. or memory problem. Others have the problem",1
com.discord,Joshtheostrich,"The updates have only made it less stable and more prone to crashes, I have to close and relaunch the app at least twice before it finally decides to load, if you use any other app or anything while in a call you get disconnected, the menus will sometimes glitch causing images too be way to big and the only way to fix it is closing and opening the app. Please fix your app discord",3
com.discord,KrakenKing,"Most recent update trashed the Android version. Channel lists disappear and take forever to load, swipe on some screens doesn't even work, it just wants to slide up or down. Channels hang really bad and loading is a nightmare now. Apple does not have these issues with the update and they have had it longer. Makes using the app a chore.",1
com.discord,E B,"The Aug. & Sept. update for this app is awful, I wish I could go back. The biggest headache is how slow this app is. Log into discord on Edge if you want a collapsable side bar and higher speed. On the app the time log info is not always accessible--you need to go on PC to see all of the times messages are sent because some times are missing. I need to access time logs for D&D games and the side bar gets annoying when I am playing games in split screen. Apple's version of the app is much better.",2
com.discord,Kaitlyn Nelson,"Discord is something I use a lot to chat with friends, but I have some complaints about the new update. Mainly that it seemingly no longer has a single mute for all notifications. Every time someone DMs me I have to mute them individually, which is frustrating. Edit: Changed the review to 4 stars instead of 3 because I resolved some issues, but now I and others I know are unable to send multiple photos at once. 2+ just gets stuck on ""Uploading"" until Discord eventually auto deletes it.",4
com.discord,SketchyKey,"The app was good before the update. Now, anytime I get off Discord (even for a few seconds), it's always reconnecting as if I lost connection to wifi, despite my phone using service or having a wifi connection. And the new UI is overly animated and sometimes slows everything down. (Edit 10/09/22): Now I can't download images or videos directly from Discord, instead I get a message telling me to ""Check my system network and privacy settings for the Photos app"" which is super vague.",2
com.discord,Sebastian Conant Guy,"Discord has been my go to app for a long time, but as of the recent update cycle, there have been major issues. These include camera feeds freezing on mobile, discord freezing several hours in the past and refusing to update, and minor quality of life downgrades, such as the camera no longer broadcasting while using another app. It was working just fine before, but somehow y'all broke it and refuse to just roll back your updates. 2 stars for the memories, but no more until you fix your app.",2
com.discord,Yuri Borden,"It a really nice app, and I've had little to no issues, however I do get an issue occasionally when I'm on a discord call. The screen won't work, a it will blackout and flicker, but I'm on so few calls it hardly matters. It might even be my phone anyway. This is delightful and thrilling to talk to friends and such. There are servers, friends, people to talk to across the world. Rest assured, I believe that you can enjoy this app too.",5
com.discord,Nerdy Dude,"5 star service, 2.5 star app. Image sharing is a nightmare in the update and the app doesn't accept shares from outside the app. Also, turning animations off in accessibility settings doesn't seem to actually disable them. Last but not least, during voice/video calls the app stops listening (not a connection issue, the app stops recording) and I have to change my mic back and forth between my headset and the phone. Please test releases more before pushing updates!",3
com.discord,Brandon Eason,"The most recent update has caused a bunch of bugs. It never loads my local gallery, so instead of sharing an inage by clicking the + button, I have to go to my gallery and share from there. When I switch channels, there's a 50/50 chance that the UI rescales to 2x the notnal size and I have to close the app to continue.",1
com.discord,Colin Wyvill,"I wish I could rate this higher, I'm running into multiple issues now because of the new updates, first of all whenever I take a screenshot or download something it doesn't appear in my recent images or anything all it shows me is pictures that I took using the picture function and even then the images constantly reappear and disappear like crazy, the second issue is whenever I try to make a role, I can't press x, finish, or skip this step and I have to close out of discord to chat, fix this",1
com.discord,Eclipse,"Discord has become my main means of communicating with friends. However, the recent change in colors used has caused the app to not be so easy on the eyes.

com.discord,Trisha_x167,"The new updates make discord slower and slower, I can barely send images let alone click on them without my screen freezing for 3 minutes. Not only that whenever I send videos that are less than the file limit, somehow they exceed the limit?? Old discord was better to be honest, much easier and quicker to use.",1
com.discord,Kayla Is Fandom Trash,I don't know why but for the past few discord is giving me the connecting... bar even when my connection is totally fine. First it was just a delay in sending messages but now its doing the connecting thing almost constantly and I keep restarting the app and my phone but that only solves the problem for about a couple hours. Also the new format of things isn't pleasing to see. In your status if you try and use the emoji you can only see a part of it.,2
com.discord,Arthur Hypernova,"Ever since Discord rolled out a new kind of image/video sharing update around Aug 2022, sometimes the message won't even load. Like when you loose focus of the app, the messages won't load and missing out important conversations. Clearing cache, reinstalling, clearing system cache, using a different Android device doesn't resolve the issue at all. Issue persists on different networks like with/without VPN/proxy, on WiFi/Cellular 4G and 5G. Currently the best workaround is to restart the app.",2
com.discord,SY 907,"I dont usually leave ratings but this new update is getting annoying fast. The text is smaller, the notification pop up just looks like messenger now. And now when I try pulling up my keyboard it ends up just swiping the screen left and right over and over. Or when I swipe the keyboard pulls ul instead. There's also the fact it's slower now. I can't even send two pics at once, it has to be one by one or else it just loads forever.",2
com.discord,Nicholas Carpenter,"Discord itself is obviously fantastic, hence the rating. However mobile discord does seem to not alert as frequently and can have a hard time networking. Of course, I'm not really sure how much of that is the app and how much is the way my phone handles background processes. Either way, when it is working then it's working great!",5
com.discord,Grace Payne,"Discord, I BEG OF YOU. Make an actual update fit for Android devices. The app crashes countless times. When it does work, I get no notifications, the text changes size constantly meaning I have to restart the app, which leads to more crashing, I cannot connect to anything, when I do, I get disconnected constantly, and many many other issues. I will buy nitro for 100 people if these get fixed. I am that desperate as I use this app daily. I cannot use it when it's like this Edit: Nothing fixes it",1

There used to be a setting for this but has since been removed. Photo is only a couple MBs, which even a free user can send, and I'm in wifi, but the app keeps crushing it down to a few hundred KBs in what could only be described as the worst compression I've ever seen. Have also canceled membership because why should I bother paying them for a service they won't deliver.",1
com.discord,google user,"After the update, UX has taken a nosedive. Not only is the UI worse, but the app is constantly loading, and messages often fail to send, despite being on a perfectly stable internet connection. I'm often unable to send images taken from my camera because of the 8mb upload limit: this is intermittent and leads me to believe it is up to the whim of the application whether to perform compression or not.",1
com.discord,SMARTMAN,"The app seems to be a little less buggy now, but the reason I took off one star is because before when I had the display language set to Spanish, EVERYTHING was in Spanish. This was very beneficial to me for immersion learning. Now, a lot of stuff in the app is using the system language for the phone (English). This doesn't really ruin the experience for me, but I'd still really like to have that back.",4

com.discord,Kayden Macey,"One of the best apps ever made. So much care and detail goes into Discord. I've been using it since 2017, and it's always been quick and reliable. Having multiple channels and threads for texting in a server is so useful and helps to organize discussions. My only gripe is when I use Discord on my computer and my audio doesn't go through in voice chats. This happens semi-often and is never a quick fix. But regardless, Discord is my favorite messaging app yet. Glad they keep updating it.",5

Trying to watch a video in full screen never works the first time, gotta hit back and try again and usually works the second or third time. Search function is much worse now with pages. Trying to upload a file is nerfed as well. UI looks ugly to me, like it's just small changes but I hate it. Oh yeah, launching discord also puts me in random servers or pms I hadn't been on in weeks.",1
com.discord,Vex,"Discord is great, for chatting/connecting. I don't know of a better message service, currently. But the UI could use work, both on desktop & mobile. There's a lot of wasted, blank space that causes both versions to take up too much room. Beyond that...Nitro is too expensive for what it offers. I enjoy the ability to use custom emojis...but that's worth $2 a month, max. The image/text size restrictions for free use are way too small, and the other features are useless to me.",4
com.discord,Sleepy Panda,"Usually works just fine for my simple purposes - doesn't want to work at my job, but that's probably because of selective signal jammers and isn't Discord's fault. Sub-categories would be cool, but I imagine that community request has been ignored for years for a reason. ^^; I don't watch clips or videos much, or attach files too often, so I haven't run into the bugs I've heard complaints about, but hopefully that gets sorted out.",4
com.discord,Wyatt Elam,"Within the last month, this app has started having unusable glitches and bugs that happen constantly, like you can't attach more than 1 file at a time even if it's below the 8mb limit, if you upload videos it will completely nuke the sound, notifications show up hours after you should've got it, it will mark messages as unread even though you just opened it, the animations are slower and clunkier, none of these problems existed in the past, and they haven't been fixed at all since appearing",1
com.discord,David Ortiz,"What a terrible update as of 9/16/2022. The layout is ugly, gifs keep crashing or do not work at all, text sending does not transition properly (almost as if the app is struggling to send message). Plus, everything is big!

com.discord,Zipper Stripper,App became absolutely horrible for Android. I tried waiting a bit to see if the updates would fix it but there's always some new problem that shows up and it's getting on my nerves.

com.discord,Ricky Hernandez,"After a few updates none of these was fixed. After the update it made the app so inconvenient to use on my fold. Granted I'm a minority but this wasn't an issue prior to the update. The app doesn't know if I'm in tablet mode or phone mode anymore until I close the app completely. Not to mention simple things that isn't specific to my phone like pressing and holding to try to reply or edit, navigating channels, and posting a gif has become more difficult to do for some reason to name a few things",2

No longer really compatible with the multi-window function; Before, discord would adjust to the side required by the multi-window function. Now, it refuses to change sizes and is rendered unusable when you use multi-window because the send button gets cut off.It crashes more.

com.discord,Aku,"With this new update things have just gotten worse. Discord is more buggier than ever, not to mention sending pictures is a pain now. It keeps saying it's compressing my images and never sending. Same goes for videos, if I send videos in portrait form it just scrunches it up and ruins the quality. With calling you can no longer turn your screen off and still have you camera on. As well as there is a huge delay with Overlay and how it shows you when you've spoken. Please Discord fix your app.",2
com.discord,Morgan Freeman,"Ever since the last big update, everything has been a buggy mess. I have to reload everything if I want my notifications to go away. The gallery doesn't like to load my newest photos. If I choose to go back to an old message, it will load me back onto that message every time I click on the chat unless I restart Discord.

com.discord,Hayashi XIII,One of the easiest ways to chat with friends hands down. I've been using Discord for around the last 8 years and staying in touch with friends has been really smooth. It's also probably the best system to use while playing games with friends. I'm about to graduate college and having class discord servers has helped immensely with keeping up to date and getting to know people.,5
com.discord,Robynn.Ninjah,"Love this app. I think that the price is fair for the nitro, particularly if you use it for group activities like DnD or game nights, but the free version is great too. It's easy to use, I like the keyboard shortcuts to emphasize words and sentences, and the custom emojis are always fun. Discord is my go to app for communication. Highly recommend. My ONLY wish is that I could send larger files like videos. But it's not enough of an issue to rate any less than 5 stars.",5
com.discord,Jake Mullins (NintenJake),"I've been using Discord for 4 years now and I've never had this many issues before. Since the update I've experienced multiple issues such as sending photos that I could send all at once, but now I have to send each photo individually despite me being a Nitro member that paid for Nitro! I prefer the old layout that Discord had before the update. I used to recommend Discord to every android user, but because of the update it's harder to recommend to friends who do not have it. I hope it's fixed!",3
com.discord,Ryan Nguyen,"Some weird discord beta feature that had to do with forced image/video compression had a lot of issues. The compression raised the filesize (from 5mb to 10mb one time).

One is that the app can no longer play videos, they either load a couple seconds and stop or are just black screens.

com.discord,KizzelFerrizzel,"App works just fine and sometimes even pretty well on my older device, but the newest update brought a bunch of bugs that's been really annoying. Such as the app crashing every single time I try to watch a video sent in a chat or my keyboard being stuck open till I close the app. These issues aren't present on the PC version. Please fix these fast because I don't want Discord to turn into a buggy and broken mess like modern Instagram.",3
com.discord,FrostBlueFire Frost,"App was fine until the recent update. Porting the iOS UI to Android is absolutely terrible. Messages are getting scrunched together, or when you send a message it'll show another user sent the message instead. When trying to scroll thru msgs, get white screens and lag. Whenever you click on the purple bar to jump to the first unread message, it jumps around 50 messages up. Sucks, please revert it back.",1
com.discord,Skplunkerin,"Discord is interesting when switching between desktop and mobile. Some things work better in mobile (like adding emoji reactions, where the recently used is actually correct where desktop it's not), and some things are worse in mobile (like clicking notifications to be taken to that message, but it doesn't and you lose the message and have to try manually finding it using the broken search input), and bad in mobile and desktop (msg scroll position is never where you last were, very disorienting)",3
com.discord,Evelynn,"I've been using Discord for several years now, and even though some of the visual updates make it feel like someone has gone into your house and moved your furniture by just an inch or two to make you stub your toe consistently, it's still the best messaging app I've ever downloaded.

com.discord,Rowan Emie,"I absolutely loved this app up until the newest updates, it's new interface is clunky and annoying to work with, it's constantly crashing, and it's lack of emotes for webhooks has made using discord with my disorder very frustrating.

Pretty much unusable.",1
com.discord,Ava Carrier,"I love this app because of how selective you can be with what you see, unlike so many other social platforms that just throw whatever is popular on your feed. It makes for a really safe environment. The private messaging and friend systems also add to that. It's overall a great experience. Never had a single complaint about anything.",5
com.discord,Samantha Mize,"Overall, love it. But the mobile app (the only version I use) give me trouble with joining voice chat. I have trouble hearing people and half the time, people can't hear me either--I've tried via tablet and phone, both use the mobile version and both have this problem. Also, the stream to voice ratio is way off. Voices too loud, stream not loud enough--even if I put stream volume to max. That being said, I use this app every single day and I'm so glad to have it. The dark mode is really great.",4

I hate the update model of ""add things a minority of people asked for and give no robust or detailed options opt-out."" I had not updated Discord for two years on purpose because I know they do this. I got the ""connecting"" error even though new messages would appear; forced me to update. Unnecessary, timewasting, resource wasting animations you cant turn off, and they changed UI text positions to be harder to read. Needs a 3rd party front end.",1
com.discord,Anthony Rodriguez,"I use discord on my phone daily as my primary messaging platform. It was great. Now, it's not. The recent updates have integrated some new features that would have great for quality of life, however, now I have to open and close discord 2-3 times just to get the app to actually connect. It's become trash to use discord on my phone, which is where I used it 90% of the time. Very frustrating. Fix this please, I've been trying to be patient with it but it's been several weeks to a month now.",1

My phone is stupidly laggy every time I open the app, audio output and input randomly jumps between my phone's built-in speaker + mic and the ones I WANT it to use (MY HEADPHONES) without warning, cameras being turned on in call crashes the app, it doesn't even show what I type while I'm typing it and takes a solid 4-5 seconds to catch up, and sending images is a hell I won't even get into since I see so many others complaining about it already. FIX IT.",1

It seems to take forever for the in-app image system to load whenever I try to send an image, and I'm only able to send one at a time. Also, whenever I try to share images from my photo app, discord just won't let me send them. I really hope this gets fixed in the upcoming updates.",3

Not only is the UI still awful & the app still underperforming; now anytime I try to send a (already compressed by yours truly) video, the app also takes the liberty to bitcrush the audio so incredibly bad that it's nothing but ear ringing static and low quality in general. Idk if this is some elaborate joke, but you guys are truly testing everyone's will to keep using the app. I assume the ads I keep getting for nitro are a reflection of that.",1

My main issue is that it's a bit confusing to use at first, but you get used to it (would it be possible to add more clear instructions?). Also, sometimes the notifications work oddly. I think this is especially true on Android. Overall, great app.",5

I can navigate the sub-chats within each server just fine, but I click and click and click on a different server and it doesn't work. Rarely it works if I just keep clicking.

I am completely unable to send videos despite them being 1mb because ""the file you're trying to send is too big"".

It is meant to show who is speaking and when, but now it doesn't even do that. I am all in favour of progress. But this is just awful.",1

Such as making roles, putting roles on people, and trying to get images from our gallery. I do not understand these UI changes as I thought it was good as is, perhaps the devs are trying to make mobile more like desktop? If so please implement the ability for mobile users to edit out images.",2

com.discord,No Umbrella,"I can't even write a sentence with this app freezing up, making it hold down my keyboard so instead of pressing ""S"" I get this ""@"", deleting half (if I'm lucky) or all of my sentences due to daring to press the backspace button once. That's without a worse version of autocorrect coming in, just popping in for when I type a word correctly and used it correctly. Yet a red line appears underneath it and if I press anything it will delete my word outright then moving to the word.",1
com.discord,lover,"i mean its a pretty good app ! i use it to talk to my friends all the time but since the update that added more categories in the settings, its just gotten worse and glitchier and buggier honestly. it crashes so many times daily and i have to send pictures separately otherwise they simply won't send, this happens on my other phone as well that's a different brand from the one i'm using rn so i'm pretty convinced it may just be the updates",3
com.discord,Strider Zero,"Lately I've been having an issue that when I upload a downloaded video to discord, when I myself or my friends watch the video the only sound that comes out is static. Is this a bug? My phone and my friends phone works fine. We can watch the videos by ourselves. Yet when uploaded, the sound from the video is only static.",3
com.discord,Aliana Galloza,"When video calling on the camera of the other person always freezes and it happens to them as well. We have to get out of main screen of our call then go back in the call to unfreeze. No this is not an Internet problem this happened to me and the others no matter where we are . This started happening after the latest update. Second, all the status icons are gone and now unable to see statuses and don't have the option to include an emoji or gifs",3
com.discord,Doyle Manor2,"I'd say this app is amazing I've been using it since 2020 but the new update is laggy. it randomly disconnects me even when my wifi is perfectly fine. and sometimes when i close a DM or server my keyboard appears & i have to close and re-open the app for it to stop. same with trying to watch videos, it sometimes doesn't work and just freezes or my keyboard constantly appears when i pause it even if im not typing. calls are also glitchy, they sometimes cause the app to close or the app freezes.",4
com.discord,itx ‚ÄúitxCaize‚Äù Caize,"After this new update it has gotten more complex, there's nothing wrong with my wifi or my connection,it's just that everytime I try to send a stack of 10 images it will say it's processing but it won't send, and the only way for me to send is for me to uninstall or restart my phone.If that didn't happen my review would be high,all though the apps great for communicating with friends and stuff like that.",1
com.discord,Romeo x,"I wish I could just give this 0 stars and call it a day. Every new update fixes nothing and breaks something else; before the update, the app Froze frequently, made chunks of channels vanish, and crashed when I sent images. New update? Same thing, except now I can't send more than one image at a time or it'll be stuck in an eternal ""uploading"" loop. Ruined a perfectly good app with glitchy updates, and for what?",1
com.discord,Charlie Horse,"This isn't a UI complaint, it's worse. They lowered performance on mobile in exchange for VERY buggy image/video viewing, as well as text loading that's janky & weird. What strikes me as odd is this feels oddly similar to how discord loaded and functioned back in their first few years... call it a hunch, but I feel like whoever they paid licensing to use their loading software probably pulled the plug and they had to go back to their old software.",1
com.discord,Quea C,"I used to love discord and still do but lately its become frustrating to use as I can't send more than one picture/video at a time, gif quality drastically declines and they become very pixelly when sent, and its laggy. It's very frustrating having to send pics one at a time, especially as someone with nitro and thats my main complaint. I've already reached out to discord and they claim that they roll out bug fixes all the time but this is very incorrect if this has been an issue since Oct 3rd.",2
com.discord,Spiritpaw,"Discord is the Best Place for hanging out with friends, or your streaming community, or even family digitally. ESPECIALLY great for gaming, mind mapping, sharing content and art etc etc. I'm even using it to write books! It's fun and has the old forum feel but with a lot more intrinsic reward and personalization, fun and useful bots, and so so easy to use! I have friends and family around the world! Best part: No ads!",5
com.discord,Zar,"The app bugs out sometimes. If I'm uploading a photo, it doesn't load my files or gallery correctly. Sometimes notifications don't come through. I don't like the new function for how to change someone's volume in vc for mobile, it made it harder - unless my app was bugging again. It would also be nice if you can watch multiple people's streams on the app at a time, and server search on mobile would be nice too!",4
com.discord,Chaotic Mind,Been using this app from day one and lately the updates have been breaking features left and right. Right now myself as well as many more have been suffering from a problem where the auto compression completely destroys the audio in video files. Every file I try to upload is well under 8MB and I do have Nitro so I should be able to upload files up to 500MB. Not sure why this has been going on and it seems to be an issue that is being completely ignored. Due to this I am giving this app 1 star.,1
com.discord,Charles Coots,Needs to promote audio communication more so the system can be improved typing while gaming is extremely hard for certain games so even a voice to text programmed into it would be great for players who have no other option. Great job on the improvements I'll gladly up my review. Looking back you've implemented everything I thought would be great upgrades good job guys keep it up,5
com.discord,Lux Volo,"Does a wonderful job keeping in contact with friends and has plenty of features to make communication fun and lighthearted. With the recent changes to the mobile app, Voice Chats and Discord overlay don't work properly. In addition, sending 2 or more image files sometimes refuses to send, seeming to be stuck at something percent uploaded and never actually uploading.",3
com.discord,Chaotic Axolotl,"The gallery in the app no longer provides all images from the actual gallery, instead only providing recent images, and not even the same amount of images from the gallery's ""Recent"" section. Not only that, but instead of at least being able to reach the end of the gallery to be offered going to the literal one, it simply loops the photos repeatedly. Beside this you can no longer send multiple photos at once.",1
com.discord,Edgar Allen Po,"I love the app but the is update has definitely skewed over my Samsung tablet, it won't stay open on a chat for long before crashing constantly. It's even worse if a feed is full of gift and images, now I'm just stuck on a grey screen everytime I log in before crashing 3 minutes later. The new layout is annoying, I like just seeing a chat box without another window sticking out one end taking up space. Which I think is the reason for the crashes as it just stuffs my screen with too many icons.",2
com.discord,Tomioka Sam,"This app has been amazing! I have been using it for over 2 years maybe longer. It's allowed my friends from the UK, Canada and the US to connect, game and share our lives with one another. Great Developer and tech support and easy to support with low cost upgrades called Nitro that enhance your experience. I'm a proud server owner for this 2-3 years now and seems like it's only getting better. Thank you Discord team, for connecting us all over the world.",5
com.discord,TrinityTheLostFlame,"New update is still bad and given the old stable version has now had support cut I've been forced to use it. The lag is miserable, I can not send multiple images at once, and any servers with somewhat active chats I can't send messages in without it sending super late. This app is something I have to use every day and this unstable mess has made it aggravating to deal with. Both on pc and mobile I have these issues. Please just make the app run smooth like it used to again, I'm sick of this.",1
com.discord,‚Ä¢Kody Bee‚Ä¢,"The new update has really messed everything up, you can't even send more than one picture at a time without discord freezing and breaking. At first i thought it was my internet but everyone is having that issue too. Not to mention if you're scrolling up through a conversation and someone texts you immediately just skip to the bottom of the conversation, its annoying. Changing things like status or user names sometimes freezes discord when you use emojis or it shuts discord completely.",2
com.discord,Passive Lemming,"No longer a real android AP. For all intensive purposes this is just an iOS app that has been shoved into a wrapper app to make it run on Android. Many features that used to make discord mobile actually decent to use are now all gone due to protocol changes. My favorite example being the previously amazing pop out feature so you could use your phone but quickly go back to the call you're in and mute, leave, or so other stuff. Absolutely disgusting discord.",1
com.discord,Reviel ‚ÄúRevi‚Äù K,Discord is a fun app but has alot of kinks it needs to work on. Overall the past updates have helped but the desyncing issues as well as certain viewing of voice chat can be bothersome still on the app. It occasionally can crash depending on your version of phone (Both iphone and Android I have experience it.) Overall like the app just hope stability improves alot more with updates as well as better responses to Bluetooth devices and with certain headphones.,4
com.discord,DANA SMITH aka Jeff,It's pretty good. Somethings are bad since it's bugged. Mostly it's a great app. Only a few complaints on the app Itself. Among other recent bugs in the app. Still some bugs in the app but they always work on the app to make it better. other bots have been working with the slash commands. Disbord was the only one having internal failer it works now. I was told to talk with discord. I said I'd try my best. Thank you for reading. It keeps crashing on a certain profile.,3
com.discord,NoMoreNormalcy,"Excellent way to keep in touch with my online friends! The only times I have issues are when hackers and hate raiders hop in and cause trouble, but things like that just end up making the good Discord servers even more tight knit. It's allowed me to keep in touch with my friends when my computer panicked and got corrupted, requiring a repair. So glad I had this on my phone prior to that happening. üòÖ",5
com.discord,N e F i x _ C a r b o n,"the app is really cool and all, i can text and not have a problem, but i have a HUGE problem with calling. im always trying to connect my headphones, airpods to be exact, and it just doesnt work, it'll say its connected, and i dont hear any audio out of it.. only out of the phone. i would love for that problem to be fixed, because it is incredibly frustrating, not being able to talk without my headphones i connect. i cant do anything with it, its like it isnt even connected. i hope it gets fixed",3
com.discord,Iam Mysterous,I've used this app for a little over a year now and in the past it was phenomenal. Now in the past 2 months I would say it's gotten worse. I use both the mobile and pc version so I know how both work. The problem I currently have is on mobile where you send a picture or a group of pictures and it is just in like a limbo. Like it partially goes through but stops at some point in the Uploading process. I hate this since it only happens on my mobile. Please fix this problem and fast!,2
com.discord,Jayden,"Massive lag for the last week or so and the last update definitely didn't fix it. Especially when trying to load files into the app. The chat window keeps glitching when the keyboard opens and closes, when going into files, when selecting photos, when sending a message with a photo attached... You get the idea. It's a buggy mess. Also all the videos show as black boxes and new photos and videos often don't show until I go into all my files and find it there.",2
com.discord,Ean De Guzman,"Fairly great app, I don't exactly have any qualms with the app itself. It's Discord, that's it, there's not really much to complain about. My only real problem is with performance. Because it is just abysmal on Android. Servers and chats take forever to load, simply sending messages take forever, and sometimes images don't load. Would rate higher, but sadly the issues with this app in terms of performance ruin it for me. And it doesn't seem future updates will fix this issue anytime soon.",3
com.discord,Joofer Jupiter,"The app is generally ok and a very good way to communicate with others. However, there's this bug on the mobile app where during the creation of a role, at the third step, the app doesn't respond. Changing the order of roles is also not working.. Also, even after updating the role name or colour, the changes do not show up in the role list. Pls also make it possible to reorder channels on mobile and pls fix the bugs. However, you've done a good job and making this app. Overall, its pretty good!",4
com.discord,clumsy pots (Oats),"I recently updated the app and I've been experiencing lags and bugs while using it, it's not as smooth as before. I also don't receive notifications outside of discord sometimes and I've tried turning it on and off in the settings and restarting my phone. video calls sometimes lag as well. I had the old version of the app for a while and it worked smoothly, video calls didn't lag and notifications were fine. How can i go back to the old version?",2
com.discord,Yeminine,"Imagine a place where your app isn't broken, laggy, inconsistent, and hard to use. I shouldn't have to stay on a previous version of Discord for it to be a smooth, lag-free experience that doesn't have any buttons moved, or the design changed for absolutely no reason. I don't know what's going on on your end, but you guys really need to get your app together. I miss the days where updating Discord was like updating other apps, an actual real improvement over the last version.",3
com.discord,Lone Angel,"Personally, the app has been making really mad and frustrated. Anytime I go to use it, whenever it actually loads, I crash approximately a minute later. So, for me to be able to use it, I have to repetitively enter and exit the app. It also keeps saying that the app has stopped working. Its really frustrating and annoying. Also, whenever I get pinged or dmed, the app freezes and crashes. EVERY TIME. I used to love discord, but ever since the two newest updates, it sucks. Please fix it ASAP!",2
com.discord,retroishere,"These new updates broke the app. I've used discord for years and the app didn't have any issues back then, ever since these new updates came out. It's nearly impossible to use the app without having any issues. Like images not loading, can't send messages, can't send photos or videos (gets stuck at 100%). These issues happen to me when using the app for only a FEW SECONDS, i have to keep restarting the app JUST TO send images. Discord on PC has no problems or even my internet. Just your app.",1
com.discord,Lemon „É¨„É¢„É≥,"Ever since their """"""big"""""" update to Android users, pretty much forcing the iOS version through, the performance is terrible. The app freezes so many times by even just trying to send an image, and a recent update made it somehow even worse. This is terrible, please fix this. Overall the app is amazing but the Android version is awful in performance, it didn't use to be like this. Edit: The ""+"" button just freezes the app now while trying to open the gallery. Well done guys, amazing.",1
com.discord,AshTheArcticFox,"I updated the app not too long ago and the VC icons are finally working again. The app still has issues with the app window size glitching, and the same thing happens with images and videos in the app. I cannot wait for these other issues to get fixed. I am still waiting for when the performance improvements come along and the random freezing/crashes finally stop. Other than these few still remaining bugs, it's a good app, and I hope the team gets stuff fixed and make the app better for users.",3
com.discord,Matthew Bergman,"Definitely gone downhill - this app lags way more than it ever did. Sometimes when my connection isn't perfect, although every other app works this one sits at 'connecting' for 40 seconds. There's also this seemingly new 'feature' that removes the send button unless everything is connected properly so I constantly accidentally bring up emojis. Over the past few days it's frozen once or twice a day now. Edit:realized I'm being too generous on the stars, reduced to two. This feels like a beta",2
com.discord,Shanna Desmarais,"Unoptimized and very frustrating - it will randomly disconnect me from a call if I am browsing a different app without warning or telling me. When swapping between streams, it can be very unintuitive and frustrating to navigate. It has started to show me older messages instead of the most recent, and take longer to load the messages I am trying to view. I love discord and it is my favourite method of communication with my friends, however the mobile version compared to the desktop app is trash.",2
com.discord,Craotic Gaming,"App is totally awesome, keep up the good work. I can stream just about anything to my friends and we can voice while playing games. Basically a really good app. The streaming bit can use a few sound tweeks. Sometimes when I do a stream it does it without audio. Like screen share and stuff like this. Further no problems.",5
com.discord,Kaela Argue,"I do love discord as a way to form communities and connect with friends. But oh my god the updates have just making it impossible to use. It doesn't matter how stable my network connection is, it takes forever for anything to load. Even messages. Sometimes it wont even show the servers that im in until i open and close the app several times. Its just getting harder to use and its extremely frustrating to see more problems pop up with every update",2
com.discord,Accel Erator,"New update absolutely ruined the app. It takes several seconds just for my inputs to register when it comes to tapping and sending media, sometimes it just out right freezes for a full ten seconds. Whatever they did to this app it needs to be fixed, this lag is outrageously bad and it hasn't been fixed no matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall it.",1
com.discord,S1M C4RD,"It just gets worse with every update. They focus on adding shiny new features locked behind a paywall (nitro), yet have clearly abandoned and ignored bugs interfering with the main features of the app. Calls have been absolutely dreadful, using a webcam is just no longer an option as any side just freezes on repeat. Whether you reset or redownload it's same thing all over again. I'm sick of this.",1
com.discord,Stormtide,"discord continues to push this new UI while it continues to have issues like not being able to upload files under 8mb because they're ""too big"" or the entire app freezing/crashing when i do certain things, especially when trying to select media or even just typing a message. this review will stay 1 star until they revert the UI update. i can't say i'm happy with the app until then, i don't even like how it looks.",1
com.discord,Douche Baggins,"Updates like these are what makes me anxious about updating any apps on android and it almost always turns up to be a mistake. The entire UI is slower, less responsive and it keeps crashing randomly. But the popups askng for money work flawlessly. And for some reason, years later half of the settings dont carry over when updating/logging in and out. Now I need to browse alternative ways to bring back the old version cause this clearly demonstrates they started cutting costs in QA.",1
com.discord,Michael Fabian Dirks,"Not recommended. An update roughly a year ago completely broke the mobile compatibility, as menus appear in random places, typing randomly doesn't work, embeds don't play at all, and other issues. This issue has persisted across all Discord updates since then, and is present on all my Android phones. Support is unresponsive or dismissive, and/or outright harmful to your device at times. Best case, you get told to write a votable request, worst case they ask you to reset your device - insanity.",1
com.discord,Laura -,"The newest update is cheeks. Aside from minor bugs it's just not as user friendly as before. It's janky and the issue where my phone massively increases my volume when watching a video at the same time as being in a call with speaker on is back, despite my media volume being at the lowest setting. It reset all my notification settings. Things take like 1-2 sec to load so it's nowhere near as smooth anymore. Do y'all even test your updates before releasing them?",2
com.discord,Feki Batotanete,"The UI on Tablet is bad, it cannot hide the channel section(left side) and the result is when you want to upload pictures the options is cut in half, cannot pick or see them. Also when trying to use floating windows (MIUI 13) the discord is on landscape mode instead of potrait (no options to change neither), which resulting very weird UI and responds. Hopely these bugs will be fixed in the future.",3
com.discord,Curtis Robertson,"I try to log into my account, it asks me to enter the 2-factor authentication code but it never sends me the code. Either to my attached email or to the phone number tied to the account. It doesn't even give me an alternative option to logging in. The app is completely useless if I can't log into it... UPDATE: my issue has been resolved thanks to the discord support team. Only problem I have with the app now is that the 2 factor authentication doesn't work with it and had to disable it on PC.",4
com.discord,coffee226,"Recent updates kept getting more and more laggy, with compounding bugs. The most recent patch made it so that the media share no longer update after adding more into storage; I have to open the file explorer to find the new media. I'm seriously wondering if these changes even get beta tested before getting pushed to live environment. The old media share was fine, I see no reason why it had to be changed. If you plan to do changes as big as this, atleast give us the option to toggle back",2
com.discord,Amagarrd,"New update made sending sluggish, editing shared links a nuisance, videos randomly black out sometimes when played, and videos randomly stop playing in the middle of it, having to either hop between channels to fix it or just entirely force stop the app and clear cache. I've done this method way too much that it's just a tedious task to do at this point. Please revert to the previous version that was much more favourable.",2
com.discord,Mekayla Anog,"Ever since the recent update, Discord has become borderline unusable. The camera freezes every three seconds no matter how many times you restart the app. The buffering is worse. Now when I leave the app the camera also turns off in calls when it didn't used to. This new update has made me prefer video calling on Instagram, because you can always see the other person even when you leave the app. Discord needs to catch up to their competitors.",1
com.discord,Yami Hime,"App has become increasingly more buggy. My audio has suddenly changed to me sounding like I'm in a tunnel with bad connection when It used to work fine. When I check chat messages, the voice chat window takes forever to get back into, I have to click it multiple times before it responds. When trying to click on people's icons in voice chat to change their volume, it takes multiple times to click it and when trying to use the slider for volume it is broken.",3
com.discord,Isaac Bryan,"It was good... however, the most recent update has screwed it all. The mini-video overlays appear where they shouldn't, my friends' videos freeze after 20 seconds (I have to go off the call screen and reopen it to fix this), there are no video settings in the settings and everything is super confusing to navigate now.

com.discord,Jack,"Reviewing again to say the app is in a worse state than it has been for a good while. My app regularly freezes when I attempt to send images, forcing me to close the app and share directly from my gallery instead. Text box still doesn't scroll like it used to as you type which sucks. I sometimes can't remove notifications even after reading and sending a reply. 1 star until its fixed.",1
com.discord,Selena,"This is a good app to text people, but the new font is ridiculous.

Also, sending images and videos take a long time. thank you for reading and have a nice day !!",2
com.discord,Paolo Catanho,"The PC version has been steadily getting worse and ever since the last major android update, it has started to reflect on mobile devices too.

The react interface is particularly bad, constantly jumping up/down inside a channel whenever I try to tap or hold on a post for more options, glitching out and closing the menu when I'm selecting a reaction, etc etc - basically every single user in my server has complained about this new update making the discord interface sometimes completely unusable.",2
com.discord,M C de Ath,"Worked fine until most recent update - appears to be choking on data now, changing server takes ages - that's if it even opens, at the moment it crashes on launch.

com.discord,Xyde,"I didn't really mind the update where everything changed and it changed like idk, server but this recent update made me lose it. this GODDAMN app doesn't let you see the recent picture/videos you downloaded, and you REALLY have to click the ""view all"" to see it, another thing is that the app has gotten so much slower in terms of loading pictures or videos, making ME have to reload discord for the 10733936th time, the old and og version was better in terms of overall performance, no exceptions.",1
com.discord,Azza,"Every update something new gets broken. It's like the devs don't test anything before pushing updates out. They never should have forced the desktop version. It's a broken mess.

com.discord,Joe L,Flexible but does take some getting used to. I prefer other messaging systems but this is a pretty straightforward streaming platform and it's easy enough to set up servers. I suspect there's a lot goes on behind the scenes as it often tells me about features that I don't really understand why you'd want them but they are easy to ignore which I suppose speaks to the simplicity of the app.,4

com.discord,Pahroce Sanctus Valen,Borderline unusable for the time being; Downloading videos often results in faulty files that cannot be opened outside of Discord; The compression system ruins most video files and when it doesn't it somehow raises the file size above the post limit so it cannot even be sent after compressing; The app crashes frequently with messages sometimes not even showing up after being sent and downloaded pictures missing from the quick send bar; Notifications just don't even appear anymore at times. [How],1
com.discord,hermione yes,"New update has completely ruined my experience, it was completely fine before but now its literally changed the whole app for me. It has random freezes, videos unable to be play videos, video calling always freezing when both me and my friend have perfectly fine WiFi, and I'm constantly having to restart the app due to it being way too laggy for me to even use. The amount of times today I've had to close down the app and restart as well as this happening to one of my friends - Please fix asap.",1
com.discord,RJ,"This new update is garbage, slower animation, messaging animations removed, extra condensed channel bars/messages so that I can't easily hold to select a message or channel to interact with it. And now there's new haptic feedback with a bunch of stuff that I CAN'T TURN OFF. Roll it back. Now. 12/11/2022 Update: The above review was given on 3/9/2022. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.",1
com.discord,Neff Sang,"Used to be fine, but as of late, attempting to send any pictures results in Discord going extremely laggy, to the point where I have to wait a while until I can click on an image, and even more to hit send. Sometimes, the keyboard even comes up but the message box does not, meaning I can't send some messages.",2
com.discord,Victor Kohli,This app was working perfectly for 3 years and was crucial for me in getting through lock down. I now cannot open the app. It constantly crashes. My phone software is up to date. All my other apps work completely fine. Discord no longer works. If the app does open its stuck in a connecting loading screen forever. Feeling disappointed because I may have no way to interact with my friends who gather weekly in group calls.,1
com.discord,Vincent Zawmek,the most recent update has trashed the whole thing. videos wont play anymore. if you try and open the image sending function the app freezes every single time without fail. and its gotten a lot slower. edit: its been months and nothing has gotten better. sending images causes the app to crash over and over and over again no matter what and its borderline unusable at this point.,1
com.discord,Maya Stray,"its okay. there's a stupid limit on the amount of mb you can send for a video or photo. i recently started getting a new problem where now, every video i send goes in bad quality and doesn't look good. please fix this, and the annoying limit of the videos and photos. ive come back to edit; i was just about to watch a video my friend sent but it now won't even play the video. please actually fix these stupid issues that people shouldnt even have to worry about.",3
com.discord,Winston Fan,"Since the last update,the app becomes useless. Whenever I'm trying to send video in the chat, it freeze at opening the system builtin File app. What is even worse is then my entire mobile phone is affected. I cannot see details of photos videos and cannot even play those videos.Also back to the Discord app, I cannot see my avatar and anything image or videos anymore. Closing and restarting the app doesn't solve the issue. I have to re-start my mobile phone every time. So tired of doing this!!!!",1
com.discord,elisabeth ristmets,"After the new updates it's so bad. I have to keep refreshing the app to see new messages (even one's sent by me) because otherwise it just doesn't show up and keeps saying ""connecting"". And even though I'm sending files that are way below the max 8mb file size without nitro, it still says the files are too powerful. It also keeps crashing whenever I'm in vc's. The app is just so buggy after these new updates and I hate it so much.",1
com.discord,ravinrabbid123,"Awful update. Uploading photos is now agonisingly slow and lags my whole phone, the app will always say it's connecting even though i never closed the app, sharing links direct from a site to discord doesn't even show my servers/friends, just a blank page, and I have to back out and retry, calls now mute me without warning when my screen goes to sleep (and it isn't my settings, i've checked). Even the desktop app has problems; rclick pasting no longer works at all. Sort it out.",1
com.discord,Miljenko Staniƒá,"So discord was a really difficult one for me to rate. Because it is free and offers basically EVERYTHING you want for an app like this. Streaming, it's free, team speak... But... The service is so unbelievably clunky, slow, weak, the connection breaks so often, the stream quality is often degraded. It offers everything,but what if offers in my experience is so awful and slow. Idk what to recommend. Use another app. It's really slow and bad. This app has it all, but is bad at everything.",1
com.discord,Mahir,"I don't know what you guys did but this compression thing gotta go. I be sending 3mb videos then this compression comes up and makes the video wayyy over 8mb. And when the video actually sends the quality is absolutely horrible, I literally delet the video coz it looks so bad. This is not a problem on pc so this 100% has to be a bug. Please fix this as soon as you can.",1
com.discord,JT Bassmat,"The app's services are great. There seems to be an issue where on mobile, you can still have being in the voice channel running in the background, however it'll automatically close itself after a certain period of time. When you open it back up again, it'll automatically connect you back into the voice channel you were in. Not sure what that's about, but I'm sure it's an easily solvable bug. But other than that, the app is great for meetings and friend gatherings.",4
com.discord,Neon Tube,"This is an amazing app but... The new update is simply awful. There has been crashes, lag, the layout is confusing now and it's not user friendly, pictures doesn't work properly as when you scroll down if you go too far, it resets but it doesn't say anything or hint or anything and it doesn't even stop scrolling it just goes back to the beginning like nothing happened. There is an option to go through the phone's files and pictures but every time I tried it, it crashes. Option to choose layout!!",1
com.discord,Silver Sniper (TheMinecraftMightyena),"I used discord for years, it's been my go to for years. But the recent update (on android at least) made a lot of visual changes that are ugly, blocky, and makes the whole thing look clunky. You notice things you don't want to notice (like the Background of folders) and the font on the text box is of a different size than what's sent. This won't stop me from using it, but I do hate how it turned out visually. Especially since before it copied the smooth look of how it does on pc. Disappointment",2
com.discord,Thanakon Brosh,"Discord was a fantastic app that was really intiutive and enjoyable to use. But ever since the major update it has become unusable. Its slow, crashes, buggy. There are a ton of issues and each update only seems to make it worse. Its bad to the point where I went from using it constantly on my phone to not at all. I would uninstall it but I still need to be contacted when Im away from the pc.",1
com.discord,Unknown User,"Okay I have to edit my last review and change it to a 1 star, new bugs are appearing out of nowhere, images missing, gifs not being the same size at it was before which is an eyesore, and what's worse is everytime I send a video with sound now... All you can hear is static from an old TV. I'm actually disappointed since I've been using Discord for years now, I've gotten used to the new look, but try to look into the problems and fix them like how they used to operate before. Thanks for reading",1
com.discord,Tarnpreet Kaur,"The app is great, however it isn't as compatible with most Android phones as one would hope. Discord does provide a great space for communication but it isn't a smooth ride along the river Nile, it lacks transitions in-between Bluetooth devices and requires the user to actively figure things out on their own rather than give a helping. Not that it is hard to figure things out, but it could be better.",4
com.discord,Caridee Vince Camat,"It's kind of awful now, it's more laggy, and doesn't really feel as pleasing to use as it did just a few updates ago. But it's still very usable, though. Sometimes I'm not able to view videos, GIFs won't play, attachments overall are pretty buggy. Every time I switch to a channel it starts to lag a lot more, before actually loading in the messages a second later. The UI feels doesn't feel so right anymore.",2
com.discord,Radoslaw Genew,"The app keeps increasing the font size on its own. I set the font to small and after some time, various channels in the left bar server list start ""growing back"", until they are back to the default font size (which is too big for my screen & eyesight). I have to restart the app to get my setting back. This could be a bug with some accessibility feature, being forced on everyone. I can read small text just fine. Stop doing that!",2
com.discord,Victoria Tremblay,"The app has been subpar for a while now. It has trouble connecting (each time i open the app, it says ""connecting..."" with a sort of loading/network bar, which never used to happen.) Sometimes messages simply won't load or appear on the app, whereas they'll appear on the computer software. Oh, and this is more of a personal nitpick, but I miss the ability to quote messages because it allowed you to reply to something specific within a large block of text. Please look into these issues!",2
com.discord,Zoro_ Only,"I do not like the new discord update, it's super laggy and it always crashes in the middle. I can't download any pictures or videos sent on it, it keeps giving me an error even though it was completely fine before, I have even checked my settings and I found no problem. It's processing speed is super slow. Whenever I restart it, it takes a while to get started. It loads way too much. Please fix this new update as soon as you can!",3
com.discord,Muse,"Similar issues to other reviews, having a lot of bugs, crashes, and freezing since the update. If I get more than four or five messages backed up in the in app notifications, the whole thing will freeze for anywhere from ten to forty seconds. The text size slider seems to not be working, I struggle to read my messages. Also can't see a large portion of the new emotes from mobile, they just show up as blank space. Not sure what big change happened, but at least on Android, it was for the worse.",3
com.discord,Seth,"The entire time I've used this app has been great (except for watching streams in calls). But this recent update has been 1 step forward, 500 steps back. I liked the larger grid when selecting photos to upload but it doesn't matter when it doesn't load properly to begin with and that's just scratching the surface of this ""update"". Edit: To the dev that responded to this, it's not a network thing, I've already tried that, it's just a buggy mess.",1
com.discord,Adam Baitup,"I'll do a review update, again. Even after reinstalling the app, it still has the same issues. Random freezes, not being able to play embeds half the time, can only send a single image per message. Minor stuff too, like it not picking up from the same channel I left it, it just decides a random point each day and keeps returning to that instead. It's just...frustrating, and tiring. Because I can't switch to any alternative, and it USED to be (near) perfect. I just wish it worked better.",2
com.discord,Yohanah Venuti,"Discord has been getting downhill since they started uptading this year. The calls are ending themselves, I'm muted out of nowhere and the camera doesn't work if I'm not on the app anymore (this could be a privacy configuration, not default). The audio quality of streams is impossible to bear with. These are only some of the problems. I use the app way more then the PC version but lately it has been almost impossible to do so. It's a frustrating experience. Please go back to what it was before.",1
com.discord,Eloria Nekoi,"It was incredible until it wasn't. Just received the new update and tge app is now unusable. It has crashed trice in twice as many minutes. It lags and doesn't respond to swiping when I try to change channel. The new visual (spacing, size, font) has messed up my brain and I can't find anything. It makes my old phone crawl. The only thing better is the response time for the bots, but that might just be my connection. How do I turn it back?? I don't want to pay for nitro if I can't even use it.",1
com.discord,Orfeas prountzos,"Been using it for years. It's efficient, I've had little to no problems with it (and they all were minor so nothing to fret over ) . I just wish the the UI when you join a voice channel could be a bit more user friendly when you have to switch between push to talk and voice activation. It's nothing major but it can get annoying. I realize how difficult that can be to change so I'm not really complaining.",5
com.discord,Delise Stoltz,"Great app, been using it for a while now. I have a problem though, I'm not able to change my pfp. This have been going on for the past 3 months. I think there was like 2 occasions where it actually let me change it, other times I was sent back to chats or got kicked out of app. It doesn't matter how many times I try, it won't let me, and its frustrating.

I can't pause the video without watching it in full screen anymore, right out of chat, and it will keep playing if I scroll down, which makes me open it in full screen again and tap in that teeny tiny corner just to pause it. Not to mention I just can't even send videos I downloaded somewhere else anymore because it's showing an error. Image view is broken too. Barely usable at this point.",1
com.discord,AllegroBenRitmato,"I'm disappointed by the changes to the image selection system on mobile. The feature is broken as by the time I have selected an image, the app has timed out; even if I am fast and do it in just a few seconds. I am limited to sending only a small selection of the most recent images in my gallery and the feature is therefore utterly unusable. For what is in every other way a well-thought out app, I beg to know why this change was even made in the first place.",1
com.discord,OwlPower669,"Lately, the android version of the app has been horrible. It was already laggy once you decided to switch the UI to the IOS one, but now in the recent updates there have been the most ridiculous glitches, like not being able to send multiple files at once (that is now fixed, but it to so long to do) and now I can't even send videos that are under 8MB due to Discord compressing them and saying that ""the files are too big!"" when they aren't. I really do love this platform, but it's getting tiring.",2
com.discord,Al Javier,"Good, but there's a bug where it just gets stuck at ""Connecting..."" even though there's no network issue. To solve it I have to restart the app every time. A little annoying but it works most of the time. The recommended methods to fix this seems to be just randomly throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks with little technical merit.",3
com.discord,denlix cutix,"The app is really good for socializing, meeting new people and making servers/groups. The only thing that takes away a star from me is the constant crashing of the app that happens inconsistently. It happens sometimes whenever I press a button, but ""I'm sure this is just a personal problem for me"" and you won't need to worry about much else other than maybe the UI.",4
com.discord,Ivy K. Parpholia,"Ever since I decided to update the app today (rookie mistake), I can't upload media (images, videos, etc.) without having to disable and enable my internet through my phone over and over again, as they wouldn't send automatically in a second (maybe even a minute) as it was supposed to. Sometimes it will work, and sometimes it wouldn't. The app has gotten pretty wonky entirely as well. Please revert and/or fix this.",1
com.discord,Claydel (Isaac),"Discord today is a staple of online communication, its not without its flaws and bugs at times but its very hard to find something else that competes with it. There might be a bit of a learning curve at first for some but its very convienient to use.

com.discord,Star Light,"I have never thought I could see Discord going horrible, but here we are. As many people have echoed, the interface took a turn for the worse. But that's not my main concern. I cannot seem to connect my Bluetooth earbuds to Discord, at all. There is no way of changing the output to Bluetooth earbuds on the newest version (144.17). Hopefully Discord changed the interface and fixes this problem.",1
com.discord,Hawk,"Recent update completely ruined the experience for me. When I am uploading files, a static loud, ear-screeching sound starts playing. I do not know the cause as the video audio is completely fine, rather it is the process in which discord takes the video before it ends up in a channel. I can only assume it is because of compression or the sort. I ask that you please fix this, as prior to this the experience was 100√ó better. I cannot even enjoy memes with my friends anymore.",1
com.discord,solysteri,"new update broke a lot of things. the UI is slow and clunky, calls are unstable and I get disconnected very often, I haven't had any issues with pictures but videos are downright broken, they used to just be a black square when you played them but now they don't even play most of the time and show up as errors in the media browser, among many other issues. point is, PLEASE. fix this horrible new ui. I've been using discord since 2018 and have never faced this many problems with it.",1
com.discord,totitolis,"I respect and love discord. The issue is that after the update, the screen turns off even when you are in a call. That is an issue because when the screen turns off it puts your phone to sleep. It makes it pointless to call through mobile. I know it is probably for power consumption but maybe add it as an option? I would really appreciate this to get fixed.",2
com.discord,Anna Schipper,"The latest update is a major step backwards, and all I see is the support team replying ""please make sure you're on the latest version"". I'm on the latest version, and I've never had a worse experience on the Discord app. The font is too small, the categories and channels are cluttered together, and worst of all, the +/gift icon in the chat moves as soon as you start typing. How this ever got released, I have no idea. Please hire better testers.",1
com.discord,Milqmochi Arts,"The new update made it impossible for me to send multiple pictures at once, so I often had to spam images one by one.

I've accidentally sent messages when I wanted to open the emoji keyboard and vice versa, which is frustrating. It also crashes a lot lately.",3
com.discord,Torrent Amador,"It used to be pretty decent, but a recent update made the app borderline unusable. You have to constantly fight against the app to make it do what you want.

Idk what intern made this update, but it needs to be reverted, man.",2
com.discord,Maya,"I don't get why discord devs have a bad habit of changing things that doesn't need changing anyway, if it ain't broke don't fix it, Sure there were bugs that needed attention, but changing the whole thing just creates more unneeded fuss. Before the update, the app was pretty smooth, in comparison to the one we have now that takes thrice as long to connect, things take longer to load and sometimes it just doesn't load at all. The update is bad, real bad.",1
com.discord,Rani Duarsa,"It's a good app most of the times. But sometimes after the recent big update, they got rid of the font size and zoom scaling which is unfortunate, and the replacement just doesn't work as well because it often changes on its own. The mobile overlay on Android doesnt work quite well either after the same update and no help has been given from support about it.",4
com.discord,V,"While the desktop app gets better and better with every update, the mobile app just gets worse and worse. Terrible state, would not use it willingly unless I have to. Lags constantly, refreshes and puts you in a different channel after solid 5 seconds of loading, removing features that worked well, not being able to upload two files at the same time, stuff like .webm (or other video clips) that can be compressed to 4mb get converted to a 40 mb MP4, preventing you from sending it. Just bad.",2
com.discord,DUJEP_,"None of the future updates don't fix some bugs that exist since the new design. For example, the app just keeps saying ""Connecting"" even though I have the strongest Internet in my house.

One of the more recent bugs is when searching for a user it seems to search several times, so when I found the user and is about to click on the name, the search is still retrieving results so it shifts the results list and I click on the wrong name. This happens a lot and it's annoying. If I knew the search is still running, I could wait clicking. Perhaps a searching indicator?",4

My only issue is that it sometimes to often crashes randomly, when I type something my keyboard would start glitching, popping up and down for a few seconds, it's annoying. Sending messages is still abit difficult, it's like it prevents you to send something in a quick speed, typing it is still abit slow",3
com.discord,Moondweller ClaireFirefly,"Wow after accidentally updating the app, I've decided to give it a 1 star instead. The layout sucks, it's super laggy and buggy. It's not the internet, it's the app itself. I'm happy to see the timer again and the idea of changing it to be similar to web browser is fine, but it was executed poorly. It's like this update was rushed. It's all clunky and clicking on channels and servers feel so slow. How could they mess up this bad? It feels like a downgrade than an upgrade.",1
com.discord,Ian C,"Normally a fine app, but the latest update absolutely broke image sharing and uploading, at least on Android as far as I know. You can no longer share images. The options to set it all up are there, but there is no way to actually send an image. Pasting images from the clipboard no longer functions either. Only directly uploading from your saved files works. Until these bugs are resolved I'd stick to the desktop version or use something else.",2
com.discord,Leo 26,"There's a problem where one can't send in many images in one go, like we're having the hassle ourselves of putting one images at a time, which is improper as there will be others who'll use a certain server.

I hope you resolve this issue ASAP.",2

No more ""connecting"" each time you reopen the app. My biggest issue is the huge sound bug. When in call, every other media sound coming from like youtube for example, becomes extremely low quality even when I set the video or sound to 4k / 24bit sound.

Keyboards dont automatically pop up while editing anymore, the video navigator is so low on the bar that you actually cant use it.

It doesn't scale properly (landscape videos are cut off, images are 2x bigger when you try to send them so you only see 1.5 columns instead of 2) videos don't play in landscape mode. Also now when you want to search you have to tap on ""load more"" instead of it automatically doing it? Clicking on the image does nothing either, you have to click on ""jump to message"". Definitely downgrading to an older version",2
com.discord,Dylan Edwards,"I've been a Discord user since 2015 and have always loved Discord since I first moved from Skype. Though slowly I've seen the app here become less and less stable, more bugs, crashes, loading issues and much more. With every update seems to introduce more bugs than features or fixes, it's slowly becoming less and less usable. The whole thing feels like a poor port never made for Android. I really hope things do change for the better since it's one of the biggest issues with Discord in my opinion",2
com.discord,Rain Dizon,"The app is great, its just that there is a bug on the mobile overlay that doesn't show the icons; ex: mute and disconnect. Although the icons are invisible they still function, but it would still be a great help if this bug got fixed, especially since I use discord with my friends alot. And during the times i talk with them while playing games, so its kind of a hassle when you try to mute and end up leaving the call. I do hope it gets patched soon!",4
com.discord,R√äAP√ã≈ò,"Barely usable due to constant lagging in the app. Before it was decent, but now its incredibly stressful, especially switching channels/servers. Also, the images in messages are smaller and pixelated, as someone who can't see well, i don't appreciate it. Might download an older version to be able to deal with it.",1
com.discord,hersa wex,"When it work, work like a charm. But when it giving you trouble, you will curse the app. Sometime the voice chat will bug out and no one can hear my voice. Same thing happened to my friend too. This is extremely annoy. Imagine you are in the extreme quest/event gameplay and comm is require to conquer the quest. The pain that you need to attend the game and fix the voice chat all at once. Very painful experience.",4
com.discord,The Nixer,"The latest update has essentially killed the app's performance and feel on my Android device, and it not only drains my battery life at a record pace but also seems to have a significant delay and difficulty in switching servers. Some touchscreen components are oversensitive, other parts are undersensitive, and it'd likely feel better if it was reverted to a prior version and built up from there rather than this new version.",3
com.discord,Andrew Lum,"The latest update is absolute garbage. Voice calls are unbearable with all the added sound effects. There's a loud noise whenever you mute or unmute, and a loud noise whenever someone joins. Text is really small, especially in the categories, and the only options are to make the text overly huge or leave them too small to read.",1
com.discord,Faggo Frankfurton,"Worse than PC version, missing features like text to speech messages, ability to adjust channel order on a server, needing you to rely on someone on PC to fix it & can break when trying to upload more than an image at a time. The selection of images cuts off on tablets so no point. Control scheme less intuitive as well, instead of a widget at the side of each message you have to tap & hold on the message then swipe up when nothing but emojis appear in order to see the options you have. Use PC.",3
com.discord,Cookie Koko,"It was a great app but recently it's downgrading. Not only that, but you keep shooting yourself in the foot by sabotaging the bots people like to use. And the people managing these bots can't even get in touch with discord to fix the problem. Getting in contact with discord is almost non-existent. If you want to run a good app, keep it consistent and keep the dialogue options visible. This makes me want to terminate my nitro again.",2
com.discord,Matt Connell,"Incredible app, i love it dearly. I have made so many amazing friends thru discord. I only just wish it would allow for controlling the quality of streams and cams incoming, or the ability to disable cams of others in order to save data. I have no other option but my mobile data, and discord eats it all up every month. I wish there were more ways i could use it, while saving on my data use.",4
com.discord,Nick Ouellette,Not sure what's up with this company lately but ever since the awful mild redesign a few months ago the general user experience on my end has been awful. Between random times the app decides to become unbelievably laggy and stuttery and random glitches with refusing to connect to the internet at times or straight up not loading images. The latest bug seems to be I now need to force close the app for images I've saved or taken to appear in the send list. Gone are the days this platform cared.,2
com.discord,Biscuit,"Ever since the big compatability update, to make android work the same as IOS and PC, the app's been broken, to a point where if I leave the app even for a second, and come back, it completely breaks and I need to restart it. This happens WAY too often, it's SUPER annoying, and, don't even get me started on the connection issues (it's not my WiFi, I get out alot and every single WiFi connection I try is the same, the app just keeps breaking). Sometimes I type a paragraph, and it just deletes!",2
com.discord,Genius Bang,"giving a 1 star. first of all, the lag when scrolling through servers,even i put most of them in one folder to lessen the lag. but it's still the same, AND sending messages is unresponsive like when i was replying to a friend the send button is not responding to me even how many times i pressed it. You update sucks, the older versions are better",1
com.discord,Martin Valchev,"It is a nice app overall, but i have some annoyances with it. For example, when I am using samsung dex with bluetooth keyboard and mouse, I always have to use the mouse to send the message i wrote.

com.discord,Spring lock zombie 115,"This app is great but the new update has literally removed the icons for the buttons so now I can't see the buttons for gifs, stickers, images, call buttons, what things I've selected and I can't even see the small icon that tells me who's active or not.

It's look is nice and not that different from the computer's look, while also with the same amount of fetures available and good quality of voice chat as well (also depends on the phone, but fine in general). Same thing for started, the app is very nice and good for chatting with others and friends.",5
com.discord,Saniya,Every small tweek has been makeing the app worse and worse over all Optimization is really low causeing major lag and crashes.

If I was on my old phone I doubt I could even use it anymore.,2
com.discord,Creec Winceptor,"Since updating to latest version attachments handling has been super broken. It does not show all the files, has no refresh functionality and also makes entire app unusable for several minutes or just crashes when you try to select files. Is there a way to rollback to older version? Right now the app works so poorly I do not think paying for Nitro is even justified. You can do better than this. And yes i have tried a clean installation of app and it did not help.",2
com.discord,Zairin,The new update ruined the initial load speed. It takes nearly 10 seconds of waiting now when it was instant before. Text font and spacing is so odd and does not feel good. Edit: it's further degraded. It now has times where it is infinitely stuck on 'connecting'. Why is it now that it does this? Why'd they break it after that update? Edit2: Now randomly crashes in addition to all previous issues. What even happened?,1
com.discord,Jovana Deviƒá,"Messages are not appearing right away when I receive them. For example, I get a message on my pc, open it. But on my phone it doesn't appear instantly.

Great app, hoping for a quick fix with this one!",3
com.discord,Axel Kyara,"I love the app... texting is easy, calling is fine and overall everything is nice. BUT this new video feature sucks! Like- listen. I respect that they REALLY need people to buy nitro, in order to make profit. But come on? I want to be able to send as many videos as I want, with whatever duration I want. In this way, your pushing your users to go to WhatsApp- or Instagram in order to text. Losing alot of customers in the process. Hey, all I'm sayin' is that you should remove the duration feature.",2
com.discord,cesar molina,"everything about the app is free. the paid features are cosmetic and improvements that are just convenient like larger file transfers. their is one thing i do struggle with and it's discords dislike for dynamic XLR mics using an audio DAC with a virtual input it often needs some settings to be played around with as it doesn't always sound as clear as it should leading to some unique issues that are very specific but inconvenient. however as a Voice,text,video,scareen sharing application best",5

Once I convinced her to use this instead of SMS, we were able to connect so much better.",5
com.discord,David Gray,"Discord Inc like to break this app, then improve it, then make the UI bear slightly more resemblance to a good design and then break the app again. This time, my installation is back to breaking Bluetooth audio, in which case there's no option to force it to choose an audio device, so I'm stuck with it not detecting headphones which work in everything else. It's getting ridiculous.",2

Otherwise a fully functional communication that has far more then zoom with better quality for video and noice reduction.

It is the most full fetured suit out there.",5
com.discord,John H,"Not always reliable. On a couple of occasions the app has got ""stuck"" showing the same content on the right-hand window, even when I move between servers. Forcing stop and restarting it didn't fix this, and I had to clear the cache and storage to get it to work again.",3
com.discord,Zircon Thecrystal,"Two stars, don't get me wrong, I love the app. I also love the android exclusive features. The reason why I award the app two stars on the playstore is because of the recent choice to make it more like the IOS version. This has made the app incredibly glitchy. Various server settings don't show up correctly, role editing doesn't work. You can't type emojis or capitals sometimes for no reason. random channels disappear, it crashes repeatedly trying to take photos. Discord pls fix, or revert :)",2
com.discord,Grim Lock,"The app has quite a lot of issues, primarily being. 1) Server building is nigh-impossible, rearanging channels/roles is either not a feature, or simply bugged as you aren't able to do it. 2) Moderation/channel swapping isn't implimented well, sometimes the app will reset and you'll end up accidentally banning someone. 3) No support for external mouse/keyboards.",3
com.discord,Christen,"This app really gets uglier every update. To be honest, I like the new layout of it. It's just that when new notifications are showing above the screen, it gets lagging until the app receives a notice from the system saying, ""Discord isn't responding."" Same though if when my friends chat to me and receive a message thru DM, it goes very slowly - very lagging. Can you please fix this issue?",2

Sometimes ui elements draw out of order, which is noticable when you're waiting 30 seconds for an item or ui element to load. Sometimes you'll select an item from your gallery to send, wait ten seconds for it to register and then it unselects the image before you can hit send, forcing you to start over. This release is a nightmare and should never have passed QA.",1
com.discord,Real Name,"Absolutely horrendous ux, the update to make it more in line with IOS was such a insane choice considering how much worse its worked since then -- constant new issues around not being able to click on random buttons such as edit or send, random crashes, the slower performance.

com.discord,Amy :3,"I never, and I truly mean NEVER, give bad reviews when there's a few bugs, but this new update has entirely ruin my experiences. The app itself still looks and works the same, with a couple of changes, however it's now SO painfully slow that it's embarrassing, it feels like this is a knockoff cuz of how bad it runs. Writing a message freezes the app and I need to wait a few seconds to continue, and the app crashes randomly. Everything is just slow. PLEASE fix this issue, its ruining the app.",3
com.discord,Joseph Kirby,This new update is horrendous. The effort it must have taken to systematically make it near to completely unusable is phenomenal. Was anything improved because the sheer amount of problems masks any improvement. They're not even bugs but full useability issues. There was lag before but it was bearable but now it's frustrating. If I didn't have to use it I wouldn't. Discord actually got in touch. Advice was download latest update. That's the issue and over a month later still is.,1
com.discord,Rayan Ngo,"Latest update is very inaccessible, send button moves all over the place up and down instead of being in a static location so it's hard to hit it.

com.discord,Apurv Sinha,"Every update these days comes with a lot of bugs and I mean seriously a lot of them. Use beta for updates and testing before rolling out on live. Live isn't meant for testing and fixing. The bugs are so annoying, every other time I open the app, the screen splits or crashes or starts acting weird. And mind you, that's the case with just Discord, every other app just works fine.",1
com.discord,morgan jones,"On OnePlus 5T, Android 10, Oxygen OS 10.0.1 Significant quality loss. Recent update made uploading pictures directly within app impossible, and in the past few days it won't send multiple images, just an endless queue, or ""finishes"" uploading but they never appear. This used to be a great program, but now since it's missing key features on mobile I'm left wondering whether I should cancel my Nitro subscription, as clearly they're getting more out of me than I'm getting out of them.",2
com.discord,TheTokenBrit,"Edit to previous review as app has gotten worse: it's laggy and freezes on Wi-Fi or data, I end up having to re-close and open it way too often to reset and fix it. Jumping to a mention always 'jumps' to message above or below so you have to scroll anyway and defeating the point. Slash commands have no scroll (either down for more commands or across for other bots) which makes it a huge pain or impossible to use some if you have a lot. Also, let us manually re-arrange threads and forums please.",2
com.discord,DisPlays,"I have been a user since 2019 and you somehow managed to make it practically unusable! Uploading images is a nightmare because Discord crashes and burns every time I try, and it feels like I'm trying to navigate the stupid app on ice with a pair of socks for how unbelievably high the sensitivity is! Please make your app more manageable, especially for older devices that cannot handle your constant ""improvements""!",1
com.discord,Saky,"I really love Discord but it's been really irritating me lately on mobile. Before the update, it was fine for me. Now I'm unable to even view a single chat with someone who sent a file; whether it be images, videos or even gifs. otherwise, it crashes me instantly. I tried to fix the crashing but nothing worked, it's the app itself. whenever and everytime I also type messages, it tries to crash me. I spent hours yesterday trying to avoid what was crashing me from my friends' DMs. please fix this.",2
com.discord,Reda ‚ÄúSepums‚Äù Kattoa,"Text sizes and spacing in the new update is all over the place. Viewing media is unresponsive. Video player controls are still terrible and now slip under the system controls, making it very easy to hit back and home instead of pause/play or seeking. Please revert to the previous UI, it was working fine and wasn't an eyesore.",3
com.discord,Jean Claude Victoriano,"After the Update Oct. 17, I was no longer able to use the Discord App Mobile. For some reason, I am no longer able to scroll through messages, tap the buttons alongside the chat box below. Quite ironic given the fact that this was a Bug Fix Update but yet this happened after the fact. PS: Would update the rating once fixed. Had a problem but the Devs immediately suggested a fix, it worked, basically just re install.",5
com.discord,Arthur F. Amante,"It's really great, a few problems however. First I can't send 2, or more images, plus I can't send videos, even if the video file is low, it still won't send, Second the loading of a single file takes so long, and Third whenever I watch a video it won't have any sounds, instead a loud scramble like You hear at a TV without a cable. Please fix Them",3
com.discord,Fox Taylor,"They swapped all android devices to the IOS app for some reason. Everyone I know is now experiencing major issues with crashing, lag, and overall the app is almost unusable at times. I've just had to reinstall it on my phone because it now gets stuck on uploading video files causing infinite crashing. A recent update has somehow broken image uploading so uploading more than one image at a time causes it to get stuck. It also automatically compresses all videos often destroying all sound.",1
com.discord,Maximus,Just terrible. The new UI is garbage and when I send a video or something like that it takes ages to upload. Instead of just scrolling and sending I now have to go into my whole files app and find something from there. Please revert back to the old UI because it was much better. Not sure why you did this.,1
com.discord,Mohamed Aminur Rahman,It's a great app to get News & updates from the game group/community. I think the Develops should add translation option in the chat option or auto translate to a specific language that the user select. It's a pain to translate each chat line by line when you're in a group chat from different parts of the world. It would be a lot better & easy for everyone to communicate with each othe.,2
com.discord,EpicSkrub730,"App used to work fine but after who knows which update, the scaling is all ü§° Every time I share something to discord the size of text and ui just exponentially gets bigger, making it impossible to use the app unless I reset it. Extremely annoying to deal with. Uploads also take ages to upload, seems it happens to other users as well so it isn't my wifi.",2
com.discord,shiberx.x,"I swear this update is the worst. The app is even lagging more than before, it also glitches when I'll try to put it on pop out mode in mobile. The audio in the calls also glitches and stutters even when I have good connection and some of the pictures/videos I send can't be seen from my point of view, unless I need to close the app and open it again. I can't even hear the music bots anymore because the app lagged again! Please fix this.",1
com.discord,Mason_does _cos,"I love discord, I really do, however there are two issues that are a large concern to me. Typical a phones battery will drain 10-20%(max) in an hour, however when in call I've noticed it rapidly depletes the battery. Also while in call the phone will begin to heat up, earlier this morning I had burnt my hand which is extremely concerning. I have talked with a few people with different and the same phone as me and they have this problem as well. Overall the app is great, but not sure it's healthy",2
com.discord,Friendzoned by Fubuki,"The newest update feels so slow and sluggish on my phone, I've checked my device and connection but there's nothing wrong with them. also video streaming and pictures upload now feels VERY sluggish and cumbersome.

com.discord,Basil Bristow,"Used to be my favourite messaging app, but the update to the iOS format has completely ruined it. The text looks weird, emojis in statuses are weirdly cut off on my phone and most annoyingly I can't send pictures from within the app anymore. I click the + to add a photo and just grey squares show up where photos used to be. I've been constantly checking for updates, even uninstalled and reinstalled the app, tried resetting permissions, everything. Nothing works. Change it back, please guys.",1
com.discord,Aransiola Bosede Christiana,"To be honest, I doubt if the update version was tested at all before it was being released. This update is so worst at frustrating, it lags a lot, to load messages is war, it takes a very long time saying connecting even though there's good network connection. To reply to messages is really very difficult, and at times what you press is different from what will be pressed. kindly do something about it cause everyone with updated version in lamenting. Or give us the old version",1
com.discord,Jayden Mayne,"Recently updated and it's just trash now. Laggy, unresponsive, sometimes just shows the same channels text even if you swap channels. Used to be great. What is going on. Edit: Updated again. Still the same. GIFS take ages to search and load. Sending a message is slow as well. Tap seems to be super sensitive and will open images, tag people when just trying to scroll. Phone constsntly flashi g a green light is annoying as well. Older versions were fine. Now its slow and un-user friendly.",2
com.discord,Angie C,"Used Discord for years now and for a long time and its the only platform I use to text people on. Yes, it has its occasional bugs but they are easily dealt with. It's a good app w/ a navigatable layout. What saddens me is the removal of Discord Nitro Classic. Friends and I only used for the emtes and anim pfps- seems like a lot for $5 a month. I've considered the $3 one which seems more valid, but there's no point w/o the gif. 10 for all perks seems like alot. althgh unsub, will still use disrd",4
com.discord,Erica Hartman,"The latest version was somehow a downgrade for me. Text for individual names was smaller, emojis have two different looks, it changed my notification sounds back to default, it vibrates when selecting emojis, and when opening the app it sometimes flashes for a brief second the channel I'm currently in (never did before). This is why I never update my apps lol",1
com.discord,HECATELUVSDOGS,"Very good app for talking to your friends, meetings, clubs and stuff like that. I would just recommend more customization settings for the app. Maybe like instead of it being just white and black maybe let other colors be chosen like blue or purple or something. I would most likely be a nitro feature but still.",4
com.discord,Aizumi Moriko,"Best social media ever :) No ads, easter eggs here and there, and it's really easy to find people with the same interests as you.

com.discord,Venice T.H.,"Still broken, still laggy: Still crashes almost anytime I end screensharing. Still fails to connect sometimes, despite never having this issue before the overhaul update - infact this is an old bug that came back with it. Still lags & crashes when loading multiple images.

Tell your PR team to stop using dank memes and slangs until this is all sorted out, otherwise It just adds insult to injury, seriously. Terrible.",1
com.discord,Mavic Bangsal,"This app is the best and really good to meet some new friends online. But there's one slight problem ever since some updates released, the videos in the choice area (where you press the ""+"" button to pick a media to send), the videos there just appears to have a grey type of screen only, you need to go all the way to View All and scroll through the file you need. The older updates, i just had to press the + button and then choose the video i want to send. This makes identifying videos harder....",4
com.discord,m1dnight,"This app was the best of best for me, not until it got updated, and for me the update was not that bad although I have been experiencing problems with it one of my main problems about the new update is that the screen keeps glitching out then you'll have to wait at least 10 seconds to open it again. Sometimes it gets very laggy whenever I react to a message or do something, kindly please fix this problem so that it won't hit it's rock bottom, Thank you.",2
com.discord,Infinit FF,"okay, this version is definitely the worst so far. i would say i don't hate it but that would be a big lie. it's triggering me so hard. you can't add emojis to channel names, can't drag the channels to another category properly, and if i send gifs the entire page lags a lot. please fix your app! it was close to perfection before, but now it's not even close. you could've made something big and better, but decided to make something buggy, laggy, and annoying. :/",1
com.discord,Hak Bak,"I only use it out of obligation. The iOS version isn't that bad, but the Android one was written by hamsters with brain damage.

Make it right. 1) Keyboard keeps popping up and it won't close down. I have to close and open the discord app again in order to stop it from popping. - ‚ùó‚ùó Most annoying! 2) Emotes tab lags - it's mild lag but you can fix it. 3) The app takes around 50 secs to 1 min at times to connect and display the content when you close it completely and relaunch.",2

Messages don't automatically mark as read when you're literally looking at them sometimes, gifs and video files are broken and just show a black screen so as opposed to just showing the actual gif or video. Your keyboard no longer automatically appears when choosing to edit a message or reply to one which makes things a bit less user friendly it'smade things worse.",1

com.discord,Marcus Mathington,"Discord overall is pretty bad at times, like when create an account(using the app, and browser version) it will require a phone number and detect suspicious activity, as if verifying my email wasn't enough. And when I am in vc, my screen constantly lags. Other than that, it's alright",2
com.discord,Salima Serdalieva,"The latest update has made the app barely usable. The overlay is wildly different and unfriendly. The app now has a ""smooth"" feeling to it when scrolling/switching through things, but I miss the snappy feeling. The app tries to be smooth, but often fails and just looks like 30fps junk. All of the text channels and chats look very different, and I don't think I'll ever get used to it. It honestly looks like what discord looks like on ios- and it is not a welcome change.",2
com.discord,Kat,"honestly this version of discord is absolutely terrible I would highly recommend finding a way to reverse updates. It constantly glitches out, the keyboard repeatedly pops up, you cannot scroll up chat when others are talking because it will send you back down everytime someone sends a message, recently when I try to send images it will show me pictures and videos that do not exist on my phone and when I send it it's a completely different video or photo and overall it just seems lower quality",1
com.discord,Fre drick,I enjoy Discord but these new updates have been really messing it up. Some issues are being unable to play videos and not uploading them either despite their MB being below 8MB (Without nitro). Another is having to send one photo at a time because it won't let you send two or three. Please fix these bugs soon! Edit: This update made it..worse (Edit#2: I had deleted the app and restarted my phone but still nothing was fixed ;-;),1
com.discord,Mango Kun,"As soon as I updated the app it starts to become very buggy and laggy, the app always kicks me out if I try to view a video or a gif, I sometimes even have to clear out the app data to even try and message someone or move onto other channels, dms, servers, etc. Sometimes the icons doesn't even show itself, so I can't see where each button is supposed to be on but they still do work the same",1

In this state it's unusable on mobile, while the PC version works fine. And please don't bother with the automated ""dev"" response, just fix your app.",1
com.discord,Richard1379,I really like this app and i had no problem with it. It has a lot of good fetures that even some random user can use. Like create a server where you talk to youre friends. And it is one of the platforms i am the most active on. However maybe it is just my phone glitchy because i crashed it a little but in the app all the icons have gone missing.

Don't pull what Amazon is doing. They don't function with the websites they make. Also, Google play shows they responded, but I can't see the response.",1
com.discord,No one ever,"If the application had a more pleasant name, it would have been a more pleasant place. Discord manifests discord. I really like the many possibilities to stay in touch on this App, so it pains me to leave. However, if theres no change made, i will need to take my mates with me to telegram. I wished the entire layout would welcome harmony above frenzy. Best regards.",3
com.discord,ivona,"Very very frustrating. Asking me and also others I've talked to, to upgrade to nitro because videos are too big (8mb limit), but they are not big at all. One was 5mb before compression and 2mb after. How disappointing, I hope it's a mistake and not backing people into a wall for cash And images do not send if you select more than one Discord was once very easy to use and convenient and now it is more of a hinder. I'm considering switching to another app or not spending a cent",1
com.discord,Artic Jay (Jane Clark),"Laggy, slow, updates content within the app slowly and clunky, it used to be fairly functional but now it often takes 30 seconds to several minutes for content to load when it's near instant on my PC. Loads poorly and all around is unpleasant to use. If i had an alternative to use i would. Have considered just remote desktop connection to my pc for a more stable discord experience.",1
com.discord,Gamer Max,"app was good to use until the new update, the GUI is clumsy, text messages and emoji reactions lag a lot, app closes for no reason and there is a lot of screen freeze too.. the previous search function was better than the current one which is as same as the browser versions. new update does not let u hover over an older message while sending new messages, it moves the screen to the last sent message rathern than being in the screen with older message like the previous versions. hope you fix it",2
com.discord,Lympha Llama,"Can't send multiple pictures at once. Also, the fact that I can't send more than 10 images when I have nitro is dumb, even when the total file size doesn't exceed 10mb. The explicit content filter doesn't even work right. If you can't make it perfect then at least enable an option to turn it on or off.",2
com.discord,Zachary Zee,"Discord is very useful when it comes to connecting with a friend whenever I need to! It looks very good and is really easy and convenient to use!

com.discord,Chad Graham,"Good app, there exists a few bugs I'd like to talk about, however. When playing a video or tapping something, there's a random chance that the channel will just scroll up really far for no reason. Something else is the same 30 or so attatchments just loop in the selection menu, instead of other ones on my phone.",3
com.discord,Jowsen,"Last updates makes app frequently crash, not load icons. Incredibly slow now, seems like it tries to load the whole chat from scratch every time I open the app. Infrequently just instantly shows messages like before so the functionality must still be there.

com.discord,Grace Senpai (hell rose's grace),"It used to be better before but now with each update it is getting worse, like I can't screenshare with audio on , i am disconnecting when i stop screensharing, my friend voice or mine goes randomly off and we have to reconnect to the voice call to hear each other's voice and the ai blocks some images even though they are not exploit images. Please fix discord first then I will change my rating",1

Nothing.",2
com.discord,Austin Lie,"this is a great app that ive used over a logn time and all i can say is that it was incredible and it has a nice number of features and usability that i think makes it pretty good. however, in the latest updates, the mobile version, for me at leadt, seems to now have issues dealing with messages. i used to be able to let messages pile up in the background and read them later, however they seem to self delete the notificatikns and no longer appear. other than that, i can say its a decent app.",2
com.discord,Petra Simon,"I gave discord 4 stars before, now I only give it 2. Ever since the new update the app only got worse, especially when it comes to calls. I hardly can stop the call or get out of the server call or if I use my cam during it, then I have to tap the button 100 times, because it just doesn't sense anything. If I do that, the whole app frozes and it takes few seconds to get it back. Very dissatisfied since the new update. Won't recommend to anyone",2
com.discord,Lucifer ‚ÄúVulGrim7‚Äù Bates,"Discord just keeps getting worse every update. It's now absolute garbage. The new layout and everything looks nice but it's so damn buggy and consumes so much more ram now. I used to be able to multi task like 4-5 apps while on a discord call and now I can't even use Discord itself properly without freezing multiple times, let alone multitasking other apps. And also the internet issue, even if I have a great ping it's always having internet issues. Other than that there's a buncha random bugs.",1
com.discord,Jaime Guzman,"They just gave up on developing an Android client and half-patched together the iOS one. The thing now is slow at best and weirdly buggy at worst. My image upload just straight up broke through the normal menu. This is EXTREMELY LAZY from a company that has these amounts of money and begs for more whenever it can feel it can get away with it. EDIT: You were right, I wasn't using the latest version. It's more broken now Add VC will randomly decide to mute + UI layout will break with keyboard",1
com.discord,Todd Rosewater,"Its absolutely insufferable to have bad design choices put into the site that a wide amount of its userbase dislike with absolutely zero way to opt out of it. The new font looks absolutely abysmal and with no way of toggling it. it's absolutely the worst experience on the app. It's honestly really inconsiderate for them to not even give a passing thought to those who are vision impared who might have trouble reading the new font with how close all the letters are, and i hope they fix this soon.",1
com.discord,Neville Bamshoot,"The last several updates have made this platform damn near unusable for mobile. The chat window constantly jumps around, videos and images break, the new UI is just ugly and things that the devs introduce, generally have not been an improvement. And the worst part is cant even uninstall the updates to back to a more user friendly version of the app. Very bad in my opinion.",1
com.discord,sabrina m,"really nice app! one suggestion I could make is when it comes to searching for images sent within chat, Can you make it so that once you click on an account, it reveals the images sent within the profile? And upon clicking, it reveals all the images sent? (from both profiles) I think this would be convenient! (: It's sometimes a hassle looking for an image and not knowing what the date was and having to click through 80 pages worth of images",5
com.discord,Margarita (Marga),"So, in my opinion this is a very great app for chatting. The new updates are pretty good but there is one minus. When sending videos (even those that are under 8mb), discord automatically compresses them and makes the videos pixelated and unpleasant to watch. I have this feature disabled in my settings but it didn't change a single thing. Please, fix this. Just incase, I'm using discord on android.",4
com.discord,Rapha√´l Ferrazza,"I'd like to start this with saying that my previous review was inaccurate. Though I think this is a truly fantastic app and service, it truly lacks in customer service. The support can often take many days to get to you and after a few hours of research, I find that the support team often blocks people who spam for help. Unfortunately, there are also people who are stuck in an endless bot answer loop who didn't spam and are getting unhelpful answers. This is still a fantastic app for friends.",3
com.discord,Logan,"The new update is awful! Things are utterly too close together in channels, you can't even use emoticons without it turning into an emoji, aswell as being unable to use emojis when making channels! It's stupid for us who may struggle with using laptop's, restricted to mobile and are unable to press the correct channels due to them being so close. I'm honestly trying to figure out how to go to an earlier version of the app because I despise this update.",1
com.discord,Oinkers Bacon,"We are now months into this dreadful version of this app. Things have only gotten worse since launch. Now additionally role pings aren't the right color, I get pings for messages I've already checked multiple times over days when I reopen the app for some reason, and more. Foldable phone support is nonexistent and I have to frequently restart the app to fix screen scaling issues. STOP TRYING TO PUSH THIS HORRIBLE VERSION! You'd be insane to convince yourself this app is in a presentable state.",1
com.discord,Richard,"I've not had as many bugs as others but I have one massive problem. Auto rotate has no way of being switched off.

Also thabk you for the popup recommending I leave a review, great idea.",1

I have no wifi issues with any other app either and my internet service is fiber. So how am I supposed to use this app at data-less spots where I only have wifi? Chat is also laggy now and I always get that apple ""connecting"" screen. I get notifications for already read chats and chats will sometimes load conversations from last week instead.",2

com.discord,Zekas,"The recent update to standardise discord across devices was far too premature and has made the app utterly miserable to use.

I was trying to use the individual letter emojis and when I would select more than one, it changed the previous emoji to a white flag with a question mark.

com.discord,Tali Erickson,"Overall great app, been using it for years, but recent update had nothing but annoying changes (visual ""upgrade"" was more of a downgrade, and the pop-up menu on messages that lets you edit them, add reactions, delete them, etc. is much, much harder to open). Hopefully those are fixed or rolled back soon.",4

More bugs than I can count, constant issues and things not working in android, visual glitches, files not uploading, bizarre UI decisions, obvious issues with app state, screen fliskers.

How can a company the size of Discord not have a QA team that checks these things before pushing updates to production.",1
com.discord,It‚Äôs ya boy Jerry Seinfeld,Its an ok app but theres alot of problems. My main problem is that notifications just dont work. Ive messed around with all the sertings so it would make noise when a notification pops up and it never does. Also when people ping me those notifications dont work sometimes either. Theres also the fact that when im in a voice channel it freezes quite commonly. Overall its ok but if i had a pc i would much rather use discord on there than on mobile any day of the week.,1
com.discord,Lia Guillaumet,"I have loved this app for years, still love the browser and pc version of it hence the 3 stars. But latest update made it so I can't use it anymore on my phone.

App is excessively laggy and unresponsive, audio just stops working entirely, or the app will disconnect from my Bluetooth headset and change to speaker when it shouldn't. I've tried 2 full reinstalls of the app and it hasn't fixed it. Having to restart my phone every time it happens. Please fix this Devs!",1
com.discord,Kyle Hallam,"Maybe if you didn't work on an iOS version and then create a bad port to Android we wouldn't be having this problem. As it stands I can not send any videos to Discord as it compresses the video before sending and destroyers the audio with all that I am left with is a video with static noise. Same with other features breaking in the mobile app, it's ridiculous.",1
com.discord,Zack Wilson,"Wow! So many great features! Like holding on a channel icon to move it? Who cares if you have to do THE EXACT MOTION TO SCROLL THROUGH THE CHANNEL BAR ANYWAY! 80% of my frustrations with this app comes from holding a micro millisecond too long and rearrange my channels instead of scrolling through them. Seriously, why is this even a thing instead of an option in the menu?",2
com.discord,Alejo Balduzzi,"Since last update where the appearance changed, the app behave very slow and freezes a lot. When I touch to write, it takes a lot to open the keyboard and to put what I'm writing. Switching channels or servers also takes lot of time and freezes every time. I tried reinstalling and deleting all data but nothing changed, I use a Redmi Note 7",3
com.discord,Mile Palacios,"In this app you can have like 100 60 or more servers and you still have space for more! The calls and chats are really good and fast, it's really easy to find a friend here and you can put whatever name you want on it with emojis or not you can, not like other apps that you can't use a name with emojis or something else and you can have a banner on your profile. That's all I have to say here. Bye!!",5
com.discord,Salma Salsabila,"The latest update made Discord laggy for some reason, it was totally fine before. I thought they'd fix it by now knowing it's been months but it still stay the same. It crashes often, sends picture slower(doesn't even want to send sometimes unless I try several times), the gallery is bugged, interacting with someone/your own messages take quiet awhile because the app going to lag whenever you want to do any actions on it. My wifi is definitely not the problem, so does my device. Please fix it",1
com.discord,Claire Welsh,"Used to be amazing but their update completely broke it. My main issue is when I post photos on it from my phone, the text in the thread, the menus and the channel list etc becomes bigger with each photo I post. Its terrible for accessibility and I can only fix by restarting. Adhering to accessibility standards is a legal requirement for many companies and should be the top priority for devs in their next fix. I want to be in love with discord again, not irritated every time I use it.",2
com.discord,Aitor Perez,"New update really messed everything up, even more because it forces everyone to use the new broken version and the old versions that worked won't connect to the server.

com.discord,Im saying Jack is Back,"An awesome app, is easy to use and you can invite your friends to chat or even meet new people. But it has it's issues, like audio issues, people can't here you or you can't hear them and past texts not showing. Overall the app is pretty cool.",3
com.discord,Sunao Gomi,"The recent UI update has broken a ton of features. Random disconnects (I've tried data, several different wifi networks), connectivity issues (taking forever to connect or not connecting at all), incorrect chats being loaded (personal chats showing in place of server text channel), camera freezing issues during video calls (issue persists on different device), and message notifications not showing half of the time (completely random if the notification shows or not despite being enabled).",2
com.discord,TheNamelessOne,"I personally love this app! You can communicate with friends, it has normal group chats, and servers allowing you to make costume channels, roles, and more. You can create public chats aswell. There are multiple communities and public servers for you to join. There also optional bots which have multiple fetures. There are no ads, and even though there is premium (Nitro) you can still do alot with the free version. There are multiple other features I don't have room to add. Really enjoyable app!",5
com.discord,Sylvain Laverdi√®re (Slymm),Still the best app for gaming. It's been improving alot over the last couple of months. Still disappointed with the lack of special stickers unless you subscribe though. And it's still a little hard to navigate tbh. for example silence notifications are in each channel or u silence the server. seems to me that you should be able to select channel mortification straight from the server notifications... if that makes any sense lol,4
com.discord,FlootGuy,New update and UI is VERY bad. GIFs do not play immediately and the interface freezes or becomes unresponsive a lot of times. It always keeps 'reconnecting' and lobbies takes a lot of time to pre-load. Chatting at a fast pace or spamming commands is nearly impossible as the chat keeps on lagging behind. The previous version was WAY MUCH BETTER. Discord is a GREAT app and I know that the dev team is doing their best to give its users the best experience. edit- i uninstalled it,1
com.discord,Dean Summers,"i can't see any icons, not for servers, not the button for putting emojis, and not even for availability statuses... now i can't switch channels or servers, it just shows me the same messages from the one channel/server i was already in, even if i close and reopen the app. This is the most busted thing I've ever used in my entire life.",1

(Samsung Galaxy j2) I've tried over 6 networks, various image types, and 3 updates! Is this just me, because in order to upload a photo, I have to email myself to another device that can upload pictures. Please fix this, because I know it's not my phone, I've uploaded pictures before, there's no reason to suddenly decide my images shouldn't be uploadable.",2
com.discord,Eli,"Wow, the last month or so of updates has murdered this app. Can't share images or links to individual contacts consistently, share contacts don't update (most frequent / most recent are all scattered), tapping a notification doesn't open to that chat, app doesn't open to most recent but seems to pick a channel it likes. 2/5 only because it still works for sending and receiving messages, just not at all conveniently.",2
com.discord,W G,"after the las update, I've been having trouble with opening gifs. they don't play probably. i also cant upload images using the + sign because images don't show there. if i want to send any, i have to click on the ""view all"" bar and open the album.

I dont know what differences were made but it's terrible, PLEASE devs fix this",1

This beautiful place used to never be this mainstream, and I am overjoyed nowadays that it is. In all honesty, there's so much functionality to it that it's just limitless. They've made changes for the better. Making servers on mobile didn't used to be this easy, but now it is easy and doesn't need a computer to do so. Chill time is instant if you have a few or one person.",5

I was notified the developer responded, but since it was wiped, I can't see that at all. The issues with latest updates have thoroughly upset me because I rely heavily on discord.

Will update stars if fixed.",1
com.discord,Alex M,"This update took so many steps back from before. Individual volumes from people can no longer be adjusted separately and is now just universally 1 volume control (this is awful), the overlay feature is a bugged mess, icons disappearing from the overlay feature, no indication of users in the call talking (icon popping up in overlay feature) and the app is generally slower AND BUGGIER than before.

Don't know if it's just a weird bug but it's super annoying,1
com.discord,Cody Kuntz,There was hardly enough room to scroll through your images when uploading and now they've shoved even more huge bubble boxes in with the quick gallery.

com.discord,Minkeei,Discord has always been a reliable platform for my gaming friends and I to stay connected and communicate when playing together. Creating customizable servers are a lot of fun! It's also very useful if you and your friends play on different consoles or PC. Discord is always evolving to meet the needs of it's users. I highly recommend it.,5

It's been running very slowly since then. This was not in the changelog or update text, I've never regretted clicking update so much. Please roll this back so that I can use the app I use most without getting a headache. Edit: the appearance and behavior of the entire app after the update is just bad. Edit 2: the latest update, pictures broke. Stop breaking discord!",1
com.discord,Jeevles,"Originally rated 5 stars but ever since they've updated it a few months ago for android users to have an experience more like apple users its been a buggy mess. Images not showing when sent, people's messages not showing until I restart the app, emojis not showing correctly in people's statuses, the list could go on. I have no problem with desktop so please show more respect to your android users.",1
com.discord,Soap,"I really like the app, im also the Amino app, but honestly I would have to say discord is easier, and better in general, but I wish you could send stickers, and ofc it's nice that you can send pictures but I also wish you could delete them as well, and voice calls are pretty good I wish it would pick up soud just I bit more, but overall the app is great.",5
com.discord,Vanessa Gochenour,"My mobile version of discord has basically broken. Its completely impossible for me to make or reorder roles in any of my servers. When i make them, Ill get stuck on the member list, finish and skip dont work, and even if i select a member nothing changes. I have to close out of the app entirely. And when I order roles, the same happens. Ill move the role and itll jump back and wont move, and if i click finish itll go to normal but wont let me enter the edit mode again.",2
com.discord,E. S.,"Was perfect before the update. Now it's ugly and hard to read/navigate, and it won't let me send images. I have to go into my photos app and share them to discord one at a time from there, because the attachment menu doesn't load any of my images. Seriously, between this update and the crypto/NFT BS you were going to pull, I'm considering migrating back to skype.",1
com.discord,CHAOS DOCTOR,So the app overall isn't terrible but now with the new Android layout? It sucks. It runs HORRENDOUSLY and you don't have many pictures you can store otherwise it turns into a complete loop. You can only store around 25-30 images and access it quickly through discord and i think that's absolute tomfoolery. Stop screwing us over.,3
com.discord,Kirsten,"Discord is a great free way to connect with many different communities, and meet people with common interests. The developers are constantly updating it and adding new cool features. The only issue I've ever had is the pricing of discord nitro, to use a few emotes and stickers it can be very expensive for users, but it isn't essential to throughly enjoy the app.",4
com.discord,L√≠cia Albuquerque,"The app in general is great, but lately me and my friends aren't getting our notifications delivered unless and we open the app to the unpleasant surprise of missed text, sometimes important ones. Also this week the app has been lagging a lot, even closing itself sometimes for not responding. I don't know where else to leave this report, but I hope these issues can be fixed soon.",3
com.discord,Spencer Frank,"Was a great app, but recently I think has been declining for us android users. First they switched to the iOS version, which i guess I get.. But now I discovered, peoples profiles when you click on them have changed - now instead of the dark gray, it's pure black cutouts with pure white text. It's minor but I find this high contrast harder to read and uglier. I feel us androids are getting unnecessary ""improvements"", especially to the UI, that just make it more clunky. Leave it be! Good as it is",3
com.discord,Flavio93Zena,"Not a coincidence that the reviews for this are completely dropping... Over time it has become slower and slower, taking ages to connect, plus that issue with videos freezing entirely on fullscreen? Such a thing should never ever pass QA or any sort of testing. You keep ""fixing"" it but it's not really improving.",2
com.discord,Mygirlaccount 2,"This app is great, but there are some bugs like, the appearance settings changes automatically, and the video calls sometimes when I try to end it discord closes automatically, they are other bugs but I don't know what to do, should I delete all updates? If you want to answer me, type ""Master Beluga (no or yes)""",2
com.discord,Monique White,"Often when switching rooms, the app marks all messages read as soon as I open the room instead of waiting until I scroll to the bottom, and loses the last read message bar. This makes the app very frustrating to use, as there are rooms I very much want or need to read all messages from, but I can't press the ""unread messages"" bar to get to my last read message if it marks the room read on opening.",2
com.discord,Nathan Thus,"App sucks after the most recent update, video's dont load, startup time doubled, messages take a solid 10 seconds to load in per channel, Bad image scaling. On top of that, the menu for sending gifs has a 50/50 chance to bug out and hide itself off-screen. Considering where the app was before, it's in an incredibly sorry state.",1
com.discord,Vales Septiano,"The update made everything, from quality of life, esthetics and usability, abismal. There are still so many bugs that needs to get fixed or address. The voice chat are finicky and unpleasant to use. It really saddens me that this only happened on Android. I use multiple device (PC and Android) but i only encounters all of the bugs on Android. I wanted to still use discord but because of this, i need to invest on a microphone (for my PC). Bad experience after the update that no one asked.",2
com.discord,Lost Sector Goblin,"Recent update feels like a pretty significant downgrade, can't change server profile pictures since every time I select an image it just resets the apps and doesn't apply any changes, same goes for wanting to upload literally any video or image that isn't recent and requires me to open the gallery on my phone. Some features just don't work anymore ever since. Really hoping they fix this or just straight up revert to a previous version since this ""new"" Discord is just so much more... janky.",1
com.discord,Revy Up,"The last couple of updates has made the experience using the app really annoying. Seems like the app locks up while trying to refresh the screen to upload files like images. Then I have to fight the app if want to text on it, if I had uploaded and image prior or while adding a comment to the image.",1
com.discord,X Cerix X,"its great! but it has become increasingly hard to find my friend requests.There is also something that bugs me alot,when you are talking to someone,you cant just stay specifically on the chat area,itll jus show me the channels and a small space for writing and if you swipe to the other side then it would show all the ppl in the group.i just want jt to fkcus on the chat area and only if i wanted to see.the channels i would swipe to the left or right. Thank you üôÇ",4
com.discord,Shadowreckt 430U,"Works ok, providing your not using it for video calls, if so this app is garbage, constant freezing while video calling, other apps are just better, then when you are sent a prompt message from the discord app asking how your experience was, their is no options available to describe how the video quality was, just options for how the audio quality was, not like thats hard to fix, 5 stars for pc use, but the app needs work, when video quality is improved exponentially, I will then rate 5 stars",2
com.discord,Len ?,"One of the recent updates made it annoying to navigate. It doesnt play videos every time when I click on play button. I have to reset the app to play the video. Sometimes clicking on an attachment, the app either automatically scrolls up or down for some reason.",1

I have to copy and save out messages and pictures to post them later because the app is always ""connecting"" it works fine on every other device, but my Samsung phone is always connecting. Been this way for years now. I just want it to work.",2
com.discord,Ryn Connar,"I use Discord every day, and while it has its blips, it is a great platform for communicating with friends and engaging with the community. The lack of star simply comes from its recent handling of the iOS/Android one-update merger, and the way it's handled it's roll out of some features, so it could regain it over time. Overall, Discord continues to grow in strength, and I am always excited to see the new features it brings!",4
com.discord,Midnight Echo,"As much as the update has improved, I'm still struggling with it. The app won't let me change my username or anything because apparently I'm writing the wrong password, I definitely am not, I use the same password for everything. It won't let me use it at all. Another problem, it takes me 2-3 times to get onto the app because it always says ""Connecting"" at the top of the screen when it's already connected so I have to close the app and open it again until it works.",2
com.discord,Bury Red,"The most recent update has completely destroyed usabillity on android. It now crashes anytime a picture or gif is loaded and considering that images and gifs are posted constantly, that means it pretty much crashes anytime its opened making discord impossible to use. Edit: Issue Seems to be fixed! Could just be me, so I'll wait to redo my review.",4
com.discord,Lisa Myhren,"The new update is horrible. The design is quite squished together now so server design looks bad. Gameplay audio isnt working properly when watching someone stream its almost completely muted cutting in and out, only voicechat audio works ok. Also a pain to see a stream in fullscreen cause it starts out zoomed out, so when you zoom in a bit the ""camera"" moves all over the place and not midcenter.",2
com.discord,Francine,"I miss how smooth this app's performance was back in July. Now, the app is laggy, always saying I have connection issues despite other apps on my phone not having problems with the internet, & crashes most of the time. It's very difficult to send messages while on vc because the app lags or deletes the message I was about to send on a text channel, & frequently freezes when I switch channels or servers. I hope there's a way to fix all of these so that Discord can be optimal for everyone again.",3
com.discord,Miika Tiihonen,"- Icons (such as download attachment, emoji list, add attachment) randomly seaco to load until you delete the app's cache. - Currently crashes when playing any video file, including tenor mp4 lol. - Pretty much every other time you launch the app it goes to connection error mode regardless of your internet connectivity, closing and opening the app again instantly fixes this. - Slide animations no longer follow your finger properly, giving a weird experience to some users. Also delay.",1
com.discord,Connor Smith,"Nothing but problems with the new update. Constant issues that range from minor annoyances to totally unusable at times. It shouldn't have to be like this. They've removed features from Nitro Classic, like changing to an animated pfp, even though they promised that Classic subscriptions would continue to be valid",1
com.discord,Kohi S.,"Finally bit the bullet and updated. It's as bad as everyone says. The app went from 4 star to just bad. The font looks cramped and doesn't fit. The old version had smooth animations, this doesn't; it jerks around weirdly. I am missing the way I could see on the left if there was update in another chat. Just disappointing.",1
com.discord,flagstar „Ç∑„É≥„ÇØ (Shinku),"This app is my most used app and loved it until the new update drops. I can still navigate like the old UI but it just feels... off. It didn't take me long to miss the old UI when it just works as I needed it to be. On the bright side, the TM trademart emoji is now viewable in mobile now. EDIT: It works fine now for me since they fixed a lot of stuff with the new UI. GIF still buggy and some pictures won't load after uploading",3
com.discord,Floofy Loof,"For God sakes the updates are getting worse, the icons aren't showing. Not even my status is showing it's color- like all of those little icons that shows what the setting/button is just grey gone, nothing, I gotta tap around to see which is which cuz it's just not there. The calls are worse, everytime my volume is up for my media I sound muffled or glitchy from my friend, or when discord Randomly hangs up for no reason is driving me NUTS. PLEASE take down the updates! It's ridiculous!",1
com.discord,Carmilla,"i love discord, but the recent update is horrible as everyone else has pointed out, you cant pick out images anymore without the app freezing and closing out. also im really tired of not being able to buy nitro with a non-reloadable card, aka giftcard. i really hope you'll implement that feature soon. not to mention i would also like to switch accounts on moblie and not just on the web version. i hope this app improves.",2
com.discord,Moses Hrangbung,First off. It's improved greatly in terms of connectivity. Less buggy and overall has much clearer audio quality. But the recent UI update is just very messy and not well implemented and my biggest problem is the new UI doesn't work at all with the mini window/app mode,2
com.discord,Pica,"I was about to not this app a 5/5 until i encountered a bug that annoys me ALOT. When i send videos, some of them will sometimes make static noises instead of playing the actual audio, i tested it on another device and it did the same thing and apparently a friend of mine also experienced this, meaning that it not a issue with the device but with the app itself, I'll probably give a better review if you fix that issue.",3
com.discord,Ren√©e Kools,"I love this app a lot and use it every day, but since a few months ago the app regularly freezes and crashes every time I switch channels or servers. Sometimes the app crashes when I get a DM. Bringing up the keyboard or the pop-up for uploading a file also takes ages.",1
com.discord,Ilinca,"The app interface just keeps getting worse and worse. Yes, the new features are cool, but the interface is trashier with every update.

com.discord,Sergio Mojica Jr.,"Newest update has this weird bug/glitch where when selecting images to send in a channel, it'll load the images on your device, but it'll also cause a lot of big lag for a certain amount of time. After a bit, it fixes itself, but it's faster to close/force close the app and restart it to get it working normally again.",3
com.discord,DarknessDev,"The new update to this app has made it completely unusable. There are visual bugs and things have been unnecessarily moved to hidden locations, such as the Blocked Users page.

Often times when I send something it disappears and I literally have to reopen the app which btw takes forever to load my messages too. And now I've discovered an even more annoying issue, my status doesn't show up anymore ?? In mobile it used to show my spotify, now even desktop doesn't work.",2
com.discord,Sanad Kamal,"I'm really disappointed with the new font and the new Ui, as the old was more efficient when it comes to both usability and lag compression, the new discord had not just destroyed the experience but has also made the main look of discord worse, the text sizes are inconsistent as well as annoying to use, did I mention the lag? As of yesterday when I try to post a small text it lags my entire phone, and don't forget the gifs, the entire thing just became not as good as the old before August.",2
com.discord,Kane,"Recent updates are actually terrible in how many bugs they caused and I can't believe that it still didn't get fixed for more than 2 months given how much users have to use this app. I have yet to see a messenger app that would have so many bugs in it, which ruins the experience, the resolution consistently messing itself up, the videos that don't play and cause you to restart discord every time, the channel names disappearing, etc. - users shouldn't experience any of this in the stable version",1
com.discord,85Min Hachigomin,"I used discord on a daily basis but the new updates were terrible. The icons from the overlay are nonexistent so i don't know where to press. I have to send images one by one and when i went to use the share feature, the enter button doesn't seem to function as a linebreak anymore and i can only see one line of texts from the message review instead of multiple lines like the old version has. I know you guys are working on a fix but please fix it soon cause a lot of us depends on this app",2

com.discord,Pyrope Heart,"Absolutely horrible, updating the app has been the worst mistake of my life, it took discord more than 10 minutes to send more than a single image, constantly crashing and lagging whenever I switch servers or chats, it never did those things a few updates ago, if you can don't use it and I suggest using only the pc version otherwise, I wish you luck.",1

com.discord,Anthony Bastiaansen,"Ok for small groups. Discord can't send push notifications to large groups of people. (Large servers). It also has an annoying banner at the bottom of the screen that suggests another channel if you're done reading the current one.

com.discord,Jenelyd Breta√±a,"It used to allow me to have my camera work despite using other apps while on call, but now it doesn't. Also, it disconnects on its own. During video calls, the screen keeps on freezing, and oftentimes, I experience some glitch. It's not a good experience tbh",2
com.discord,erin_keller,"Frequent crashing, and for some reason the ""skip this step"" option for making roles isn't functioning right and I can't get rid of the role on myself because it forced me to add a member to it because it wouldn't let me skip the step. And for anything to save I have to close out the app or else it will freeze",2
com.discord,Rainbow-Anthony Lilico,"Only thing I can think as a flaw (compared to other apps) is that the new user experience isn't all that clear. Since the way Discord works isn't like other apps, some people find it hard to get started with. Might help to explain the ""point"". However as an experienced user it's my number 1 choice and I love it.

These problems are particularly concerning on a social media platform.",2
com.discord,dusk327,"The app is still ok. However, sending images and videos is a nightmare. First of all, why does it take so long to compress? Second of all, why is my 2mb video saying that's it's ""too big to send""??? I thought the limit was 8mb for non-nitro users, and I think 2mb is WELL within that limit. It makes me feel like nitro is TRYING to be forced. Videos and gifs also decide they'll just stop working and you have to close and open the app to fix it. If this wasn't an issue at all before then why now???",2
com.discord,Catrina Awa,"I love this app, and I use it everyday to text my friends. It's practical and convenient but the reason I gave it 4 is because you need to have to send a specific amount of data when sending videos and pictures +etc. You have to get nitro to send larger files and it's quite annoying how I have to cut some parts of the videos I want to send because the files are too large, I don't want to buy nitro just to send larger files or send longer texts.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",4

Odd scrolling behaviour, sluggish UI, intense resource and battery consumption just to name a few points. If I was a mobile-first user I'd gladly cancel all of my subscriptions. They've also forcefully sunset the last Android native version to force an upgrade to this trash. Do not use until it's fixed.",1

Please you guys should do well to fix this up ASAP cause it's really beginning to get annoying.",2
com.discord,Jazzberry,idk what you guys did w the updates to this app but ya broke it. put it back... sending 2 images at once breaks the entire app now like it gets stuck at 100% but if i send them separately it works. it also occasionally randomly just doesnt show any of the chat contents unless i restart. it didnt use to be like this..... will fix my rating once this all gets fixed.,1
com.discord,Roscoe Lester,"Really like the app, it is amazing for me and my friends but recently when I'm making a sever, I cannot put emojis on the channel name. It's really annoying because I used to be able to do it and it's frustrating especially if your sever already has emojis in the channels because if you want to change the emoji or make a new channel with emojis to match it, now, I just won't let you. If this is a bug PLEASE fix it ASAP! Also, every time I send a video it just sounds like static! It's annoying!",2
com.discord,Pia Eugenio (kun),"Discord is just a great app all in all; good features, and everything like that. Except, ever since the update with all the new stuff, such as the designs and the appearance when you're in a call, it's been lagging for me a lot.

com.discord,avarine ‚ÄúAvee / Vee‚Äù,"(talking abt dc for mobiles) Last few updates destroyed this app a bit, literally. It became laggy and buggy. Earlier I was able to disconnect from the notification list, now when I want to do this, it just doesnt respond, and I dont know if I'm still on call, or not. Also the font size changes out of nowhere by itself, I cannot fully open the list of people that are on vc. Please, give us back old discord, new version is amost unusable :v ...",2
com.discord,Jess,"The newer updates still don't seem to have addressed any of the major changes from the last update that went over poorly. In addition, my phone will no longer go to sleep if discord is active AND the app changed how pictures preview and they're ridiculously tiny. You don't need to preview 30 at once.",2
com.discord,Dr. Derpy,"Absolutely stunning app! It's great for gamers, students, and basically anyone who wants to hang out online! This app is great for messaging, privately or in a group, calling, video calls and more! This app supports a lot of fandoms and points of interests so that anyone can find their place! And the grand thing is.. that it is all made by the community! You can easily create a server for any subject, add rooms, chats, and customize it as you wish! The app is cross platform, absolutely love it!‚ù§",5
com.discord,Fe,"Used to be my favorite chatting app, wayyy beyond it's time. But the new update is very buggy. 1. Unable to send multiple image together, they'll be uploading forever 2. When sharing from other app to a certain channel sometimes it doesn't get shared 3. Opening channel is somewhat buggy and it will open other channel instead The new features and design are kinda nice but they're not worth the bugs the new update introduced",3
com.discord,Cnord Chan,Discord is a good app that it allows me to join server with bunch of friends from text message to voice message and even group video call plus watch video together at the same time! Developers are also working on the down sides and fixing bugs on Discord from time to time. They are also adding in more new features which currently is still at beta stage. It did take a while to get use to the functions but believe me you will fall in love with Discord!,5
com.discord,Jason Addison,"New update barely works and some useful features have been removed. -media takes longer to load -filenames removed(why?) -gifs dont work -profiles showing wrong info and barely loading (no banners on most) -often getting black screens when trying to load videos.

com.discord,MrseCode,"Although some problems were fixed in the recent update, which I commend, changing someone's nickname still requires an extra step compared to before. There's also the reactions are slower, and sometimes you cannot enter your texts, or react to another text, and many many more.

We tried several other programs, like Google Chat, and Microsoft Teams, but none were even a little bit as good as Discord. I personally enjoy how well the calling works and the incredibly plentiful features. I love how it is completely malleable to my preferences, and it seems there are infinite ways to use this wonderful piece of software. Good Job.",5
com.discord,HalimKairin,Auto log out after a while? Seriously. I have a phone and ipad noth using the connected to the same discord account and i rarely open them because of work lately. But the most stupid things happened! The discord on my phone decided to auto log out by itself and now i have to log in again but it's been a while and i completely forgot the details. Plus the 2 factor authentication is too much of a hassle. Now i can never be able to log in my dicord with my phone anymore. Thanks developer.,2
com.discord,E C,Great and easy to navigate app! Perfect for voice and video calls to hang out with friends. The sorting channels to have different areas of discussion are fantastic.

com.discord,Lisa Carr,"The apps great and usually works just fine, it's useful to keep in touch with friends from faraway and make new ones. Overall the apps amazing and would be a 5 star but recently all the new updates especially the visual ones lower the ratings, the new updates for discords visuals don't look that good it looks blocky or out of place and the colours often clash with the light gray background mixed with this dark black color just doesn't match well",3
com.discord,Claire Farron,"Awful UI in the new update. When I'm alone in the call it pops up this dumb prompt ""invite more friends"". What if I misclick? Then some random person on my friend list would get acess to my personal server? The audio bitrate bug is insane. I have to unplug my earphones all the fricking time to fix it. When I join the call - noone can hear me until I mute and unmute. Menus are buggy, buttons are buggy. No more OpenSL ES option makes it hard to use during calls with Bluetooth (low bitrate). üë∫",1
com.discord,mattias sosa-tremblay,"I mean the app is good and all for comunicating with your friends and all that stuff but i think needing to pay to send files over 8 mb is a little bit unfair.

I checked on everything else that i could send it on, it always worked fine exept on discord. I mean i still reccomend the app but a lot of bugs can happen.",3
com.discord,Simon Finch,"This discord app simply sucks, sometimes when i minimalize a stream it duplicates. When i quit a voice channel and minimize the app i join the same call that i quit hours ago. I have a bug when i'm talking with somebody the messeges won't load so i need to restart the app and quit the call in order to read something. There are lot more problems that i can't leave in this review.",2
com.discord,Tom Juarez,Use this mostly for voice chat for meetings and posts for communication/info. Pros: -easy to set up and use. -customizable -can assign levels of moderation Cons: -default is all push notifications so w/o changing settings you'll get push notifications from everyone about everything. -voice default levels are high. When someone new joins VC they're deafeningly loud until you lower their volume. -sometimes app can sap bandwidth from other apps. Can make online gaming challenging.,4
com.discord,Bwear Taffy,"So much lag in the new update!! It's so hard to upload photos, because it takes well over a minute just to send one photo. It gets me so frustrated that I just close the app. I love using Discord, and I would be so happy if you guys could fix this issue.",2

Camera still won't work, no proper notifications from calls anymore, having issues where there is a blank spot on the screen where keyboard supposed to be though not open, small the active and mobile symbols (have to squint to see it), not a fan of how big the text is when typing, if I type a longer message, I can't see what I'm typing, issues with replying. All too raw and not properly tested.",1
com.discord,Uluxa,"Adding more and more updates doesn't help. You ruined the app for the phone completely. I could describe exactly what exactly is wrong from the recent updates but here is in short: gif freezes, app crashes, videos failing to play, channel freezes. Also other problems like high quality gifs make phone commit suicide and lag ungodly bad. I have a new quite expensive phone so the problem is not that. Editing this now for 2 stars, some of the issues are fixed but a lot of them are still there",2
com.discord,Ken Li Kim Khiook,"Generally good experience but last update seems to have bugged the app for me. All the icons for menus, send button, etc were gone (servers specific ones were still visible) so i had to navigate the app by tapping around purely based on muscle memory.

Whoever came up with it should gst FIRED. -eleisp",3
com.discord,Ridgid Ray Penafiel,"The GIFs aren't sending fast enough on latest updates, also, the gallery option when choosing pictures to send kinda became lame, back then I can just directly go to gallery and Discord would remember what album I've opened, now, its just down right bad, like, I need to literally browse my whole freaking folders just to find the picture I want to send... It's literally a DOWNGRADE NOT UPGRADE",2

com.discord,Crazy Artist,"As much I wanna give this a 5 stars cause I've been using discord for a while now, Recent update isn't really doing well. I can't even send pictures normally without the app going slow all of a sudden then it slowly glitches until it just crashes itself.

When I'm editing a channel in any server, Discord doesn't let me put emojis anymore; I like to put emojis to make it easy for me to find, but he simply doesn't let me do it anymore, he erase any option of putting emojis. If the devs please could fix this, it would be just perfect. Waiting to put my last star in the review.",4
com.discord,Elise,"It's a really good app but I just wish the calls were a bit better! Because every time the camera is on it freezes every 30 seconds, it is very annoying but, it is a pretty good app for texting, so I will it give that. 3 stars!",3

Now the image uploading menu and profile viewer have both broken in new and interesting ways üòÄ Edit: Broken interface mostly fixed now, but the emojis remain broken. Why are they the system defaults, Discord has it's own custom emoji that weren't ever broken when part of a user's status. Just put it all back, this isn't worth it [12/3/2022] Nice coding. Absolutely nothing loads now.",1

com.discord,Ira Sood,Discord is my most used app but I must say idk if its a new update or something but all of a sudden the fonts have become huge and the names in particular r big and bold. I have been trying many things to make it change back including deleting and downloading the app and checking stuff on my phone settings to see if my phone has anything to do with it but I came the the conclusion that it wasn't my phone that did anything and that it was the app but I still don't know how to change it back.,4
com.discord,Raeleen Davis (Rae Rae),I love this app lots but they keep changing supposed bugs and making things worse when nothing was wrong.

It also got super buggy when trying to choose an image to send and opening and closing the app didn't help. durring that it wouldn't even let me leave a call for a while despite pressing end call. it's been bad for a few updates and has been increasingly getting worse which is a big disappointment counting how much i rely on this app for easy messaging.,1

Half tempted to just quit discord,2
com.discord,Werewolfgirl,"I love everything about this app, the easy quick messaging, the way you could mute just one channel in a server. The only problem I have is that I can't send most videos bc they're too large. I'd buy nitro, it's a good price, but it's not fair that I don't have the money to spend on it. Other than that it's fun to use! üòÅ",3
com.discord,Sleepy Son,Hello. I revently updated my discord app. But it's getting worse than before. The loading process is slower compared to previous version. The app try to keep checking my permission on every channel over and over and sometimes it doesn't load anything (due to; idk; but maybe because it can't read the permission (not about app permission) or whatsoever?) and must restart the app so it can try again. Goodness. I should've known to not update the app if it just makes it worse lol XD.,5
com.discord,Steven Schembri,"Excellent chat platform. Made for video game streaming integration, but even outside gaming, the voice chat and share screen features are all there.

I cannot post gifs or photos and I can see any ot shows the poop emoji and gives and error and I've already googled it and looked up reasons for this issues. I reset my DNS and it's not that.

Also the times to upload images is BLOODY long, the app is overall slow. It's not my phone as it's brand new. Please give the better 5$ nitro back instead of the cheap one.",2

Loading times are ridiculous, half the time the in app camera just Does Not work, and oh god I don't know why they changed the image picker but it's constantly flickering now and barely shows any images. I have so many more complaints but not enough space.",2
com.discord,Addy Y,Latest update is an eyesore to use. Where's the fluidity? Half the time I don't catch the messages of people replying to me in a busy server just because the UI is so bad and cluncky. Absolutely terrible. Also the spoiler is an eyesore to read. Trash update Edit : y'all keep doing back. Removed the mentioned tab for no reason. Poor decision,1
com.discord,Brandon,Terrible. The new update has broken everything. Video call with headphones? Call connection and disconnection plays through headphones but not the audio for the actual call.

com.discord,Aspen Scott,"I use discord daily, and with the recent updates my conversations will not update with the new messages unless I force stop the app and restart it, Same with images. If I go to send one I just took or saved I have to fully close down the app then reopen it just to share stuff with my friends",2
com.discord,Evan Laawson,"Latest Updates Ruined Discord. It was working just fine until the updates from this last month. Finding emotes was more organized and you coud just skip to the section you wanted. Another huge problem is thatbthe keyboard will randomly pop up randomly and then it will not go away. Get rid of""Wumpus"" if he's back and in charge of the app side of discord. Update: I keep getting videos I post with the sound all distorted",2
com.discord,Evezi Omuyeh,"The app is good overall and I like discord, but after the recent update the mobile experience has been okay bad. But something I dislike especially is how I don't have the option to turn off the sounds when someone joins or leave a calll, ir when I mute myself. Even when I turn everything down the noise from connecting to a call is so loud. Also big servers now run slow on my phone when they were running perfectly fine before.",2
com.discord,7992,"I'm not sure what's happening but I can no longer use the app. Edit: It's not that I cannot access the app itself, rather I cannot access my account, and/or reach out to people's servers or DMs. There's this eternal little bar on the top of my screen telling me I don't have connection, even though my Wi-Fi is completely fine. Apologies for my poor choice of words.",1
com.discord,ACE BRYAN,"Ever since the new update,all the video files I send in servers are automatically compressed by discord despite them being already below 8 mb size before I sent,this is very frustrating because there's no way to turn this file auto compression off and it makes the quality of my video files I send very noticeably worse,Pls add an option to turn off auto file compression in the app, that's my only complaint for now.",1
com.discord,Gray Peach,"I've had Discord for about 2 years now, and I've been a Nitro subscriber for about a year. Discord is a mostly pleasant app, and even though it does have bugs at least they try to fix them. However what's upsets me is that if you wish to make a new account not only do you have to verify your Email you must also verify by phone number. Both are required However it gets really annoying when I'm trying to make a alt account on my PC and I have no phone number, because then I cannot use Discord.",3
com.discord,Space Twinky,"Love the app. However, as of updating it on November 10, 2022, I can't even use the app. It doesn't load, and crashed after five seconds. Please fix this soon. Update: Uninstalled and reinstalling the app seems to have fixed the issue.",4
com.discord,hxneydaisy,"app was great, it's easy to talk with friends and other people. but the update on phone is not it. it sometimes lag when I'm typing, the text is always big and then small all of the sudden, the about me section is also too big.

com.discord,Shep,"gotten used to the new ui, still have nostalgia for the old one but it's not nearly as bad as I thought it was. Only thing I've been having issues with at the moment is whenever I take a picture or a screenshot it won't show up in my sendable media till I restart discord.",5
com.discord,real silverjunk,"Awful, solely because it randomly disconnects from calls. If you're having a sleep call and your phone takes your eyes away from the app, it kicks you from the call. Yes I have all the battery/app related things that could cause this disabled already. It's the only app that does this.",2
com.discord,Pris Heartz,Used to like this app until they changed it to look like the pc version. Ever since there's been bugs. Right now there's a glitch where i can't cancel my subscription or change my subscription. When i did use my balance in Google Play it took the money but didn't update my nitro. It won't let me use the gifted nitro credit for my subscription. The subscription says to update it by October but its well past October not letting me cancel the subscription.,1
com.discord,Dr. Nerd,"The app has been so ridiculously buggy recently, everything is laggy I keep getting forced out of my menu to type, if I don't select an image from gallery in a certain amount of time it doesn't send, images don't show without needing to go onto gallery. I can go on and on but am not wasting my time.",1
com.discord,Captain Baku,"Discord refuses to let my bluetooth earbuds work, in voice calls, and when i select the option for bluetooth, it just goes to my phone's native earpiece.

com.discord,Jim Aubrey,"terrible app these days, can't send some 30sec videos without paying. file can be under 3mb and discord will ""compress"" it to over 8mb, somehow, just to try and get you to pay. add that to the inability to disable auto-emojis and its just garbage all around. tired of every app always getting worse for users, it was fine until a few updates ago and now it's just garbage.",1
com.discord,Moz Khiar,"I dont like this updates it have bug , lag , and ... 126.21 version was better and stable . In this new update, even the photos are loaded by force .

com.discord,Mark Woods,Everything works great except one thing which upsets me tremendously. The microphone will not speak and type. Microphone works on every device except for my note 9 mobile.

com.discord,Titan Long,"I made an account and hardly used it. Deleted the app. I just recently wanted to try and use it again but it won't let me verify myself. Yes I tried to log on 1st and it went straight to verify. Tried to make a new account... gotta verify. The verification won't work because the number is already used. Yes it is and the verification code the sent originally to verify my account wasn't valid. Sorry, I was about to rant some more. May you all that read this have a great day.",2
com.discord,Chaeli Leu,"You've been told so many times how bad the new UI is, and this new update just makes it a thousand times worse.

Fix. It.",1
com.discord,Lily Sousa,"why was the time of day removed from the timestamps of old messages. genuinely what benefit comes from that. bring it back please. not to mention each new update making the app more and more unusable. Why does the font size change every other time i open it? why does taking a screenshot make the entire image selection ui bug out? I appreciate android being given the same features as other os, but enough with these stupid changes, i just wanna be able to use the app properly :(",2
com.discord,Mann Patel,"It was the worst experience ever. I tried to buy nitro because of the perks. TWICE. I tried it through my phone, so it only gave me the option for google pay. One of my charges was running SUCCESSFULLY in google pay, but it failed in Discord. Then I tried again after 7 days. Same thing. The transaction is pending on google pay and failed in discord. Unnecesarily charged me twice. Refund will take 50 days to process. Support was not helpful at all. NEVER BUY NITRO.",1

Hopefully someone writes a better chat app soon. Never saw such a bad Skype replacement.",1
com.discord,Lucksure,"This app used to be really well made, Interfaces crisp, Functionality good, Issues little to none but sadly the ""New Update"" kinda ruined the app. In fairness the devs have tried to fix things however it's still barely functional. Especially now with the new BETA feature for profiles I don't want to have to scroll all the way down to check their mutual servers etc. How they could resolve the issues; Add an option to make the interface back to the old one before the update. Fix gifs lagging hard",2
com.discord,GRUMPY ANISE,"Latest updated broke it, it seems. I figured I should update because updates usually make apps more stable, right? But instead it became laggy: the screen freezes for a sec every time I scroll a chat, and receiving a new message doubles the problem. All the other elements that require scrolling/swiping are lagging too. It became extremely uncomfortable to use this way, sadly.",1

But all without any improvement.",2
com.discord,Lauri Jussila,"Overall I use Discord constantly on a daily basis and until the updates recently, it has been working just like it should: Smooth and quick. But the recent updates just messed the whole app up. The new look isn't too horrible in my opinion but typing is way slower since it sometimes just freezes when you try to type, sometimes you need to restart the whole app because the channels in servers just disappear and loading times are way longer than before. I'd be happy if even those would be fixed.",1
com.discord,Harshal Desai,"Really miserable experience after the IOS port update. Messages will appear as if they were sent by the wrong user, images will disappear as soon as they are uploaded and a restart is required to see them again, loading times are much worse and messages frequently fail to load... Not a fun experience whatsoever. I understand wanting to combine codebases but the user experience should have been prioritized more before the change was rolled out. It's like testing wasn't even conducted!",2
com.discord,Leo T.,"New version is full of problem, the new UI doesn't help. When sharing an image, grey lines appears on the screen (they go away when I switch between salon). The messages and reactions (of the salon I am currently in) don't immediately load when opening the app. Profile's banner now need loading time, etc. To sum it up, the app is now messed up and using has becom very annoying. Hope that the next update is soon (and actually change something).",4
com.discord,Pearoo,"The so called ""stable"" version is not stable at all. If you download a pic and want to send it, you have to completely restart the client if you want to send it. Loading simple messages take a lot of time for no reason. There are bugfixes for non-existant bugs, and the features that discord adds are features no one asked for. Borderline third world countries don't have localizes pricing, Hungary is at 25%+ inflation and 10‚Ç¨ is a lot for any subscription for lower-middle class families.",1

Downloaded it in 2018, picked up using it more around 2020 and haven't slowed down since.

com.discord,Diatrei Moon,"(Edit) So I got my discord working again. And then.... you updated it, it's alot more complicated then it needs be now, 1. I can't out how to add roles to people (mobile btw) 2. The general layout is just so different the then before, I think there should be an option in settings or something to be able to get the old layout back, 3. Typing is super annoying due to lag. I just want the old discord back. Thanks. (Oh yea, this was one of my favorite apps until the new update. Not anymore ig)",1
com.discord,Blaz Filip,"Decided to update the app, what mistake that was. Couldn't boot the app for 10s before it would hard crash, literally unusable. Managed to fix it with a bandaid by clearing my data to force it to log me in again, after which I immediately opened settings and under Text & Images disabled: sync, display when posted as links, display when uploaded, show embeds, and sticker suggestions for good measure. Figured due to gif from Discord supported tenor that was hanging. Hope that info helps. Fix pls.",1
com.discord,VGAHayden,"Discord continually reduces ease-of-use for things that work perfectly fine to the point they're worse. - ""Searching Emotes"" now requires the entire emote selection be enlarged & an extra button press. - Text Bar font is bigger than what the actual channels display. - ""Pressing Down"" on a message to bring up reply, mention, etc, now has a big delay & can even fail to happen. It's also multiple platforms & devices. These types of changes push us away because they make the experience worse.",1

It was forever connecting and didn't show notifications in or out of app. After switching to the updated version, it used to be good on a phone but ever since I updated it, it has been nonstop laggy and unresponsive. It no longer shows me the exact time I've been playing something for and images take an ungodly amount of time to even begin sending. Virtually unusable. Go back to how it was before.",1

This only happens on mobile and not on pc. please fix,2
com.discord,Mathieu Scharr,"New layout is still bad, completely unfunctional for landscape and generally poor for mobile.

The channels mostly disappear Whenever you go to your gallery on discord to send a message you cannot see the right side fully.

com.discord,John Cosentino,"Yeah, no. This new UI is sluggish and the roles don't even load properly half the time. The app performance got punted away to cut dev costs with React Native, and the users are feeling it. This is a giant leap backwards. Also, searching chats doesn't populate previous chats if you scroll up. This makes searching broken and completely pointless. Another issue: blocking should completely hide messages from blocked users. Also, they shouldn't be able to see your messages. This needs improvement",2

com.discord,Patrick Glenning (Frostwh1sper),The one thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is that you can't customize skin tone for emoji responses in the mobile app. This could be as simple as implementing a user setting in the app that changes the default for these few customizable emojis.,4

I do have couple issues with it though. I'm part of a system, and the emoji system broke, and Discord is refusing to fix it. It's honestly really annoying. I hope that this can be fixed soon.",4
com.discord,Senur Kabopkinin,"It was a good app until a recent update. Interface slightly more complicated, I have to reopen the app in order to see images (when I say I can't see images, I mean literally no message pops up), and I have to view a message like 4 times in order for it to be read.",1
com.discord,an enby french fry connoisseur,"Much like many other reviewers, the app has been left in an unusable state for me after recent updates. The app will periodically crash for no reason, as if typing and receiving a DM is now too much for the app to handle. The app also now refuses to let me post more than one image at a time, and minimising discord to open a new app - and then reopening discord - also causes the app to crash. I have to wonder if these updates were tested at all, as Discord has become unusable.",1

com.discord,Sticks,"Literally so buggy. Emojis in statuses aren't centered correctly and don't use the discord/twitter emojis like they used to. Uploading files is a huge pain because it refuses to load unless I send the files individually.

Honestly these updates just have made the app more buggy and a pain to use.",2
com.discord,Tempest,"Discord is an amazing app that I use daily and talk with friends, but recently in the new update almost every video I post, all the audio in it is just complete static, random lag & freezing and randomly getting kicked out of VCs and the app itself.

Please roll it back, it was fine before. Update: With every patch it gets worse and worse. Screen share crashes the app and maxes volume overriding the phone. Write over app discord buttons are a blank bar. Moderator controls just randomly don't work. Can't force DC, mute, deafening, etc. Just busted.",1
com.discord,Robert,Half of the channels are missing unless I do an update every other day and even then it still goes away after 24 hours.

The layout is incredibly confusing now and I have no options to adjust it such as adjusting font sizes, which vary between my keyboard, my messages, and the username of whoever im messaging. Emojis no longer function properly for me, and the app experiences consistent crashing issues and notification bugs. Was going to get Nitro before this but now i refuse",1

com.discord,Wildfire,Needs to go back to basics. It's not far off becoming Skype 2.0 reskined. You should have just sold it to MS and moved on. The recent heavy pushing Nitro ads everywhere and discovery of embedded trackers was what made me uninstall and look else where. Such a shame.,1

There's also an issue with sending MP4s that already fit discord's limitations. eg. I try to upload a video and it's 6.5MB, discord still tells me it's over 8MB and recommends discord nitro. There's also an issue with picture-in-picture when playing any sort of mobile game. Buttons on the text box go missing or don't register, and when I try to maximize it gets worse. I'm using a Moto G Stylus (2022).",1

The reason for my negative review is because there have been several issues I've had while using the app that other folks are also dealing with. These issues include images and videos failing to load on occasion, choppy or problematic voice chat sessions, random crashes due to poor app optimization. The new update has not helped whatsoever and it's actively taking away my 5 year experience.",1
com.discord,Richard ‚ÄúRichie‚Äù Walker Jr,Videos uploaded from Android phones now have an EXTREMELY loud static noise no matter what I do. I can no longer use the main feature Nitro of being able to upload larger file video sizes due to it being pointless thanks to the static noise that is being heard on ALL videos uploaded from my phone. This only happens on Discord. Any other app I upload videos to is just fine. Ever since they migrated the app to horrible cross platform instead of Native Android code this app has been TRASH!!!!!,1
com.discord,ReaI Aress (ReaIAress),"This is so great to chat with other friends and people in any server, DM, and some but there's something wrong with photo won't load, ""Failed to load, please try again"" it needs to be fix, everytime I sent it didn't load but other people can see it.",5
com.discord,Meera Sridhar,"The calls are glitchy sometimes. Sometimes the other people in the call can't turn their camera on and sometimes your own camera doesn't work. This happens randomly. Also, you can't view the other members of the call while streaming which is a bit annoying. Otherwise it's a pretty good app!!",4
com.discord,Johnny Lombardo,"Great for talking to people I know, however I sometimes have a problem if there is a large amount of messages where it will put me at the bottom. Or if I'm trying to read, and somebody sends a new message then it will put me at the bottom. Besides that, great app.",4
com.discord,Dark Wolf,Updates keep making the platform worse. Now Discord gets stuck in Landscape Mode on Mobile and using Voice Chat is just not possible. Playing a game while chatting with friends causes Audio to disappear and crashes constantly when trying to stream.,1
com.discord,MissMintea,"This app actually sucks when I try to login or change my name / password. I tried logging into my account and it said I have to verify it, I put the code in and it keeps saying rate limited or invalid. Even if I don't put the code In, it still says that. I tried copying and pasting the code and it still didn't work. Like bruh. And then before that, I tried changing my name and it took so long as it kept saying I put the wrong password in even though I didn't.",1
com.discord,Phoenix,"The layout works fine for mobile phones, but does not work for tablets in landscape mode. I have to slide it to the right to be able to type and scroll. Also, the app is unusable in split screen mode, but was fine before the new UI update.",3
com.discord,Matthew Devine,Horrible audio quality because devs force you to use the app in call mode. Group calls are pretty bad due to their poor decision to not let people to change between the different audio channels and the one feature that could fix it was removed by updates. Also can you guys fix the text channels forcing you down by like 20 messages every time you scroll up too far? Final gripe is push to talk can slide the ui so I pretty often cut myself off mid sentence by it sliding the ui on accident.,1
com.discord,Cristian Rocha,"A lot more difficult to use after it was updated for mobile, it's harder to create new servers and roles. It's also more difficult moving (""dragging"") roles to the correct area you desire. The screen will move by itself upwards into a channel which is extremely annoying.",3

Also the text size is so bad now, certain texts like channel name in channel list. there is only option for zoom not change text and the zoom just sucks cause it zooms everything. TL;DR - this new update is so bad please revert it , also please don't reply with some copy-paste.",1

Thank You",2
com.discord,aaa aa,"making a new review because it's gotten worse! discord will no longer allow me to send more than one god damn image at a time. ive tried updating, which only led to more bugs (automatically switching channels, crashing when i close a stream, text getting smaller on its own). ive tried uninstalling, only for it to tell me my login info is wrong. its been the same for 5 years. at this point the devs have absolutely deplorable abilities to fix their entirely dysfunctional app. incredibly hostile ui",1
com.discord,Chei Seri,"Dont get me wrong discord is a fantastic and free chat experience. I have moved off of actually textong people and started chatting on discord. It is so much better than anything else i have ever found. But mobile sucks. I dont have favorited gifs. The layout is a tad messy, managing channels on the go is alright but selecting texts to delete is a little frustrating. Overall a spectacular app that i couldnt choose an equal alternative to. Discord should replace all texting services.",4
com.discord,Mr. Smooch,"Very useful for group chats and more 'fun' options than some competitors but locks some good features behind a pay wall. If discord charges ya for it, Skype probably does it for free. At least to some degree since I've used Skype instead for sensing big files and things like that. Almost everything has a discord server these days though so it's very useful if you're a part of many communities.",4
com.discord,Kiela Ahearne,"Yes Just Yes Discord is a great platform with a great community The server features are amazing and I really think this is one of the best! Now it's not perfect and does have room for improvement, But it's up there near perfect.

com.discord,Katrina Morris,"Discord is one of my favorite apps for seeking out like minded gamers. It's so easy to create and manage fun servers.

Overall, I'd certainly recommend discord to a friend.",4
com.discord,Hekkaryk Kcalb,"Discord is de facto best communicator on market right now, and it's free.

com.discord,Talia Hobbs,"I use to love Discord but now this whole new thing is making me wanna change communication platforms. I've been waiting for at least 2 hours, some people have been waiting to change their emails for over a week, they might as well just delete their account.

UPDATE: It's easier than ever to learn the basics!",5
com.discord,A.R.B,"This app has dropped down in quality so fast after recent updates.

com.discord,Jimmy The Pirate,"Works great on PC. On android it is super buggy, it doesn't ring, it gets stuck in a call deathloop. It stalls a single users chat screen across all users selected. When it isn't buggy it is sweet though.",3
com.discord,Eva Savaria,"I love this app so much and I enjoy talking with my friends the way its let me over the years, but this recent major update almost makes it unbearable to use.. emojis are now automatically cropped 1√ó1 so certain emojis can't be uploaded without being cropped out, certain actions the app absolutely will not let me tap unless I back out of the menu and go back in (or just restart the app) and sometimes I have to restart the app to get images to upload in chat :/ maybe let's roll back one update..",3

The rumor is a poor iOS port.",2
com.discord,Naz_Novo,"Great app and a wonderful peace of software! One tiny problem tho... since the last 3-4 updates I've noticed that sometimes every thing just break down... like calls getting glitchy and I can't go into the community channels that I'm a part of... and no it's not my wifi, because every other app works fine, like YouTube or snapchat for example. But yeah if it didn't crash it would be more or less a perfect app to stay in tutch with your friendsüòä",3
com.discord,Caila ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Koring,Dear gods the loading any time I click a notification. I have no idea what you guys did but this app is very demonstrably worse for it when it comes to loading and general usability now. I can no longer add new emojis unless I only want half of them as the emoji. I have tried resizing dozens of time to fit the required sizes and dimensions. No matter what I get asked to scale it and it will not let me actually do anything. This is absolutely ridiculous and broken and has been for four months,1
com.discord,Kuba CeTe,"Discord drains so much battery! It is my main messenger and after 15 min of texting my battery drops by 10%! I can't have discord on my phone now because of how bad is my battery life. Also I've seen many other users complaining about that: OnePlus, Pixel, Samsung(me: Galaxy S22), Oppo users. It's clearly the fault of Discord not phones. This year's updates of the mobile app are ruining it! It is laggy, crashing, draining battery, loosing connection, freezing. Simply unusable!",1
com.discord,Gabriel Leung,"Much better. Ever since adding Android tablet support, now the app is no longer just a widened smartphone view. Now I could completely see all my chats on the left, alongside my voice channels. Only thing is that sometimes the app is still a little unstable and buggy.

com.discord,Zai Akio,"love this app, been using it so far for commissions, and for my friends. only thing i hate about this is the excessive lag, also is SO slow to send a message even with good wifi. please to also do bring the old layout back, its harder to make and finish my server(s) without the keyboard limit and the new layout. so far 2/5 as my ratings ‚Äî good app but new layout, lagging, alot of changes so far uh, well it suck. will change review once fixed :)",2
com.discord,Johny Amber,"All went well but the internal audio when screensharing, it has no internal sound except for the speaker one, and i'm on Android 10.

com.discord,ii_ Enivo,"Great app overall, however, strange encounter, happens rarely, if you use a foldable phone those from samsung for some strange reason instead of scrolling it moves your screen left/right, only way to fix this is by reinstalling the app which is strange, I'm not annoyed, it's just really strange how on other devices it works perfectly fine.",4

com.discord,Akina,More and more either discord down or it glitches especially the no notifications glitch.

com.discord,krbayis plays,I like the app I use it daily to talk to friends although I would love it if I could use it on my PlayStation it makes things so much easier than having to use my phone constantly and take up so much internet because of it if you guys could add a PlayStation version that would be awesome,3
com.discord,Nishad Nadkarni,"This apps really easy to use. I am an art teacher and use my Discord to chat with students on the class server and can easily create threads for them to submit homework. It's also easy to talk to friends, it's easier for the students to take help from me or just otherwise reschedule classes or adjust timings. I also use discord for supporting Indie game dev servers which is really convenient. My students are 13 year olds and easily learnt how to use discord within their first week of using it.",5

First off there's so many instances that the app would freeze, kick me out of calls, won't send any images/videos even after it says ""sent"" or ""100%"" I really adore this app so much due to it being the main source I use to communicate and play video games with friends.

I doubt it isn't a money problem anymore, just an effort problem.",2
com.discord,Master A,"Recent updates for this app have been absolutely awful. Before the entire UI update, I was able to use the app flawlessly and see everything from gifs to videos. Now 80 percent of all images videos and gifs no longer load and force me to close the app and reopen it just to watch a 4 second video. These bugs have gotten out of hand to where the mobile overlay doesn't even work anymore. For the love of God discord, if you're going to update the app at least make the update work.",1

Great customization for pfp, name tag, premium pluses etc. Its one I instantly reinstall everytime I get a new phone. Best app for chatting whem gaming with friends or discussing projects together. Could make their video call/chat signal better though, even with the best wifi on both sides I always get choppy voice back.",5

We prefer smooth experience over some laggy app.",1

My only issue is that with I've reached Master lvl in the Titan challenge so I've had enough to purchase necessary shards to upgrade ship. Only the last two evolutions increase my star lvl but I am not able to upgrade as it prompts me to upgrade again. Previously any ship you evolve at that max lvl you are able to upgrade more and I still do with other ships just not that one. Pls fix this bug as I have put time into the game and would hate to put it down.,4
com.discord,Krim Rowe,"So! It is quintessential to games, yes. The UI is built for ease of switching, you can get updates from other servers in your server, and link it to your game accounts, and your Opera GX can sync to your account. You can customize just about everything on your personal profile AND server profiles, and with Nitro you can do even more. With a 2k character limit it also makes Discord pretty great for roleplaying! Easy file sharing is a bonus. So! Discord = Perfect. imo",5

com.discord,Nathan Hyde,"The other person who said ""-3 for the buttons"" and the app developer responding ""sorry you're missing 3 buttons"": clearly didn't understand that it was a 2-star app rating because of the glitchy update.

Floating videos get stuck on stream, freezing vidoes in calls, the call to action for selecting user volume on calls doesnt work half the time, and freezing apps. Wifi or data and this all happens. My up and down is 250 Mbps. They really said let's slap the Apple UI and call to actions on Andriod playstore and sent it out. Edit: Mid Sept- October 31th and still minor improvements.",1
com.discord,Velo,"New updates are so badly optimized it overheated my phone to the point where I couldn't hold it properly. Had to take my phone off it's case, and in my disbelief the battery got inflated. I'm not sure which came first, but I had to get a new phone. Afterwards, same problem, but to a lesser extent because of more capable hardware. This app is pretty much a hazard. Reverted to the old version 126.21, and everything works perfectly. Everything is otherwise perfect tbh.",1
com.discord,Jason Amato,"Unable to use the app any longer. Using my Samsung A42. Discord has a new TOS that must be acknowledged but the ack button at the bottom is in the same location as the square that minimizes an app and takes user back to home screen.

They made a security system that they couldn't even fix the issue if it locks you out, I still love Discord, but until they fix that flaw, they won't get more than 3 stars. Luckily, my old music creation phone was still linked to my account, by Google Authenticator, which would only let me login using that phone. Removed 2FA, until that flaw is fixed, I'll stick with a long and complex pass for security...",3

App no longer dynamically adjusts size between front display and unfolded display on my z fold 3, I have to close and re open.

So disappointing",1
com.discord,Kel,I truly enjoying USING the app and have done so quite a lot but on my PC when I go to uninstall it it is not listed under programs. I also don't see an uninstaller in the folder even after unhiding things. In Googling I have seen a ton of people talking about the lengthy (at best) uninstallation process. I have gone to Google Play in the hopes it would give me an uninstall there but no. I am still working on this but this is a BIG issue for me and so I must rate it low. Please help.,2

It will close the push notification but will still show the notification and unread symbols inside discord. Kind of annoying that you have to go to each ping individually through each server.

There should be an option so you don't see anything from muted channels unless if you go to that channel specifically",2

Even then, you can join servers to socialize and meet new folks.",5

com.discord,Mason Emerson,I started using Discord during the pandemic. And initially I thought myself too old to actually be able to adapt to this new tool. But my children help me come in and I have now become at least functional in using it. There are still a few things that I don't understand about the tool.

Not to mention that I try to load photos and it won't even show them half the time either when I search my recent photos to upload. The update has made me seriously consider using another app.",3
com.discord,Nguyen D (DismalAmoeba),A shadow of its former self. Discord must have fired or ignored its QA team because this new version post iOS unification is nowhere near the original version. Issues include: -Massively spaced out user list to take up needless space -Instant showing of text -Read private message still showing up as notification -Random autoscrolling to earlier point in time -Not automatically opening up keyboard when editing messages -And more It's usable and they have fixed a few bugs. Wait and hope.,3
com.discord,Dark Striker 06,It says any file below 8mb is allowed to be sent. However that doesn't seem to be the case because even files that I have been able to send before have files sizes around 7.4mb. Now since this newer update I haven't been able to send them again.,3

com.discord,Jordan B. (Lazarus),"Been using mobile since almost as long as it's been available and this new update sucks. Images take far longer to upload, sometimes don't at all even with Nitro, and leaving the app for more than a few minutes puts you in a random channel in a different server when opening again.

This new look which I hear was literally just making the IOS version of it to the android version was a huge screw up and honestly more of a downgrade than anything. A perfectly fine app that worked cleanly and smoothly now runs like a potato when a gif is present in a message. I hope they listen to the community and revert this so called ""update"" completely instead of trying to make workarounds. The app was completely fine to begin with, why destroy it?",2
com.discord,Brad Wilkinson,Great for chatting with fellow gamers. Shame that when you 'long press' on a comment the options don't always work. Scrolling to the top or bottom of the list seems to help.,4
com.discord,CC55 the God of Bread,"Used to be great. These recent updates have been literal trash. Constantly lagging and crashing me and my friends' phones to where they just randomly restarts (the phones). Images and especially videos are extremely glitchy and laggy, some just having static for audio. Fix this. It was better before all the updates that came before March 2022.

Its so clunky and just feels bad it's almost unusable. It even effects my keyboard and makes it harder to type. Everything is annoying and there's just not a single aspect where I feel anything has been fixed. It looks bad, it feels bad, and it's only had mediocre updates after the logo changed.",2
com.discord,SOLAR SKIES,A very good app to interact with others and have a total fun! But one of the drawbacks is that (very common with all other apps too) the bugs and glitches.

com.discord,Cole VanHill,"It's better than any messaging app I've used. Wish it was more mainstream outside of gaming communities.

Overall, solid 7.5/10, would recommend.",4

Update! This latest update fixed my issue yay! Thank you!,5
com.discord,Aastha Kumari,There are floating notifs at the top of the app whenever u get a new msg from any server and most of the time it gets pressed on accident. Plus most communication apps have a voice note feature. Discord seems to be lagging behind when it comes to adding actual practical features.

In isolation the Android app only deserves one star because the codebase switch utterly ruined it. Terrible performance, annoying bugs everywhere, and inconsistent UI/appearance.

com.discord,Tanner Vaughn,"Things WERE good, but recently, Discord has seemingly dropped the Nitro file size limit to 3 MB instead of 8 MB. Anytime I attempt to upload something above 3 MB(For instance, 5 MB), Discord says the file is ""too powerful.""

I will give 5 stars once this is fixed.",4
com.discord,Hollis Schmidt,"Getta a helluva lot buggier on androids lately. Not updating/sending messages, constantly disconnecting from server despite having full internet connection.

I don't have Nitro but I'm honestly considering it because my friend has it and says that it's more than worth the money.

com.discord,No thanks,When I try to send anyone a downloaded image or video I dont even know what im about to send it just shows as a black screen unless I look for it in the files app which is very annoying and gets tedious. Also another problem ive encountered is when i reply to people from the notification I get on my phone not in the app then I check on the app to see if it sent it doesnt show what I said or what the other person sent. The last problem I found was that sometimes videos dont load.,2

They also keep wanting me to upgrade my OS, not realizing that that's unreasonable to request. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this app and how dictorial it has become. Do better.",2

A friend I have in the same server is able to add them, but I'm not sure why I'm not. It could be a bug to look out for. Overall, I think this is a great app and I highly recommend it.",4

In servers, users who use server profiles are glitchy, sometimes displaying their account profile picture instead of their server one.

Third it would be nice if music bots played normally through the phone speaker instead of mic. VC sound is horrible on mobile. This app is too...",2

com.discord,Emily Tomney,"Before the big update discord worked fine then it changed and became a problem for me and my friends, for example tho one guy friend has it updated the app will not work on his phone at times to the point of having to uninstall then reinstall your app. It interfering with my time with them but also cuasing my friends and myself issues so please work harder on fixing something that didn't necessarily have to happen in the first place",3
com.discord,Purple Girl,"Please for the love of God, fix the issue with the gallery from discord, when I take screenshot and I try to pick it to send it to someone, it doesn't appear. So I have to restart it every goddamn time. Please Discord don't fail with your app now.",1
com.discord,Jhessa Dranciang,"This app is getting worse. You will just got disconnected to a call for no reason, you can't even hear the Voice of the other people even though they are not in mute or in silent. Keeps on connecting even though you have good internet. It will just suddenly restart the app and its so long to load, specially when you visited other app for just a couple of minutes. It keeps on lagging if you swipe its lagging. It even take so much data.And its getting boring most bot doesn't work ANYMORE.",1
com.discord,X G,"i don't dislike the app, I use it every day but it feels like with every update everything gets slower and if I save pictures on my phone now I have to close the app and re open it just to select newer pictures, this was never a problem before the latest updates (approximately 2 months ago)",2
com.discord,AKIIIRA,"It was great up until the recent updates, they broke the entire app. Videos don't save correctly, it takes 5x longer to compress files than it used to with the same file size and internet connection, crashes randomly, and doesn't show me media posts I've made until I restart the app",1
com.discord,Christy Olson,"Been using Discord for years, and it's really become THE app for online game players to communicate more easily and get to know each other. The best features are that you can share pics/screenshots and gifs (where most game chat systems don't allow that) and it allows you to contact (ping) someone, or even call them, without needing to share private phone numbers! Highly recommend!",5
com.discord,Winky813,"I don't know what happened, but now anytime I upload a video with audio to send in a message the end result is the audio is boosted to max and very crackly. The files are fine on my own device, it only does that after they've been sent.",1
com.discord,Panjuure_bin_Rifaru,"simple word. since last big update, it becomes worse for mobile version. need to disable picture and video preview, sudden freeze. now i cannot even change my discord server name unless i do it on PC. one word, fix it. so far only my friends that keep me from unistalling discord. give a good fix so it was worthy to buy nitro. i will remove this review if there was a fix to solve this issue",1
com.discord,lilly snow,"8/5/22 Please rollback. While in a video call, switching apps turns the camera off in discord. This isn't a feature, it's really dumb. 9/19/22 Still did not fix previously stated comment. Once again, I have no idea why it's even a thing. At least give us an option to turn it off or on.",1
com.discord,Umbreon Tears,"I love, LOVE discord. I've used it for a while now and would be giving it five stars, if it weren't for the latest update... Since I updated it, I can't type at all on mobile and it keeps completely freezing on me. This is really really irritating because I don't have much PC access.",2
com.discord,Mya Schmidt,"I'm very upset with the new update, it looks weird on my phone, whenever I type out emoticons like :) it changes into emojis and there's no way to turn it off, it's buggy, things won't load, my notifications aren't happening and the font looks weird, I hate everything about it, I love Discord for talking with friends but these updates aren't it",2
com.discord,Soup Tomato,"DISCORD. NGL BEST HANG OUT APPS EVER. HANDS DOWN. Though there might be some issues related, like audio and sudden disconnected, with audio driver and also with the output/input. Which might getting annoying and frustrating. But, maybe if came from the conflict audio or something. But hey, so far I loved it!",5
com.discord,Courtney Wagner,"Ok app. Messages are a bit chaotic. Admins are annoying about rules of where to comment etc. Not really an app issue, just frustrating. Doesn't always work right. Right now it's not switching between different threads. There's also this extremely annoying ad now popping up. But I'm Glad to have something away from fb/ig where I don't know anyone!",3
com.discord,Sizzle Vegetables,"Well-built app & easy to use. Also, they don't spam you with ads/pop-ups. They have integration with ""bots"" that can make your custom Discord better, and there are soooo many free customizations available. Additionally, they offer better services if you wish to spend money. I have not spent any money, and I would 100% recommend.",5
com.discord,Moe McNeely,"I use Discord to stay in touch with people on 2 games I play plus the news feeds and official announcement rooms. It works great, never a complaint from anyone I know. I've been using it well over 5yrs, I can't remember. There are many other functions I haven't used.",5
com.discord,cherub,"usually good, but something has changed and now when i'm in video call the other person's camera freezes and i have to minimize the call then pull it back up to fix the frozen camera. happens about every 60 seconds. been happening since 10/24. also i can't press the ban button on my galaxy zflip4 when i need to ban a member in a server. it's unclickable due to the location.",2
com.discord,Christian Mattia,Only reason as to why im giving it 4 stars is because: 1. Most things are locked behind a pay wall with very limited things being free 2. There are still lots of bugs and stuff relating to calls and the sharing of images and videos 3. Also becuase they are removing most of the bots that were helpful or good to have in every server Otherwise this app is extremely easy to use and a great way to call your friends during a gaming session or just a online hangout.,4
com.discord,Divyesh Raje,"Discord is starting to get worse with each new updates. The crashes still occurs to frequently, and now with the recent updates, it is badly lagging. Can I please get the old version of discord back? It's difficult to use discord with all these issues now.",2

com.discord,√∏ Qriticc,This update gives me mixed feelings. I havent noticed any significant UI changes but now my app crashes whenever I play a video or even see a gif. Sometimes when I click on a chat that has a gif it'll immediately crash discord- then when I open it it'll be on the same chat and keep crash-looping. Its really annoying and hope it gets fixed soon,3
com.discord,Jocelyn G,Essentially it's a better version of Skype. It's becoming more and more buggy as time goes on. Now you can't even see if someone else is in a dm call with you on mobile anymore. Update: Recent updates (past Aug-ish of '22) have made mobile use infuriating. Every update brings a new bad thing. It's almost like the app is trying to die.,1
com.discord,KENLUXE,"Please bring back the old version. The new update is so buggy and clunky and just looks bad. Profiles open by themselves and I called a couple of people by accident. The only good thing is that people can see what I'm listening to on spotify on mobile right now, not just PC. Everything else - extremely unbalanced.",2
com.discord,Lemtil,"Mobile notifications are generally between 30 minutes, and 24 hours late. Useless as a mobile messaging app. Had to delete part of my review cause the developer response bot gets hung up on that part.",1
com.discord,Nicole Sanchez,"The recent changes have made this app super inconvenient, I no longer get push notifications for messages and have to force close the app to manually check for new messages, I'm not tied to my phone waiting for messages to get through, it's frustrating leaving people hanging for 2 hours because I forget to manually refresh discord, no app should work this way, especially when my push notifications worked just fine before, I'm glad I stopped paying for nitro if this is what your app has become",1
com.discord,Tristhan Lebag,"The app is very wonderful and very good for chatting with my friends and can talk to other peoples. my only problems is when you forgot your password at Discord there is no ""forgot password?"" button this would be really helpful to people who forgot their account password and the other problem is sending photos just a picture cost nitro which other people cannot buy it is really unfair just for sending pics and not letting people edit their backround profile please really add this. Thank you ‚ô•",3
com.discord,Organic Trash,"Horrid update. I absolutely despise the update's new design, bad functionality and UI. Bring back the old! All updates until now were tolerable, but now it's plain ugly and no longer UI friendly. Even the color change is peeving me off, as everyone who had the old Discord ""gray"" as the background no longer works",1
com.discord,Michael Bradley,"The most recent update is terrible. It crashes when I try to open notifications. The broken ui makes it impossible to join voice calls. Various media embeds don't work anymore. Unfortunately, there's no way to roll back my version on Android.",1
com.discord,skalatoor,"I still stand by discord being one of the best ways for people to interact with each other on pc but recent changes to the android version made this app look inferior compared to all other competitors. constant crashing and when it does work I might get stuck in ""connecting"", icons disappearing, images not showing up in the menu, the ui is clunky and everything just feels much slower",1
com.discord,folafolafolafortyfo,"Video cam too close to other periphials. Also, last few updates are very, buggy. The UI is not appealing anymore. It crashes, the loading screen takes forever to load. Can't preview links, gifs/jpegs are blacked out. I pay for Nitro and it's really only worth it, for the cross-server emoji usage.",1
com.discord,vener somthin,"Discord used to be a hell of an entertaining app, until now after like a big batch of updates it has just.. genuinely disappointed on the new look in the phone plus that large amount of glitches, update: the ""unable to send SMS"" doesn't show up now but instead it just doesn't send the code meanwhile saying that it did, wasted 30 minutes just waiting for the code arrive but with no results, hopefully you guys fix this anytime soon, thank you.",1
com.discord,Skylar Brown,Not mine but my boyfriend's: Last night he couldn't voice chat with our friends and I. He heard us but we couldn't hear him. Discord wouldn't let him speak and he tried everything from restarting the app and he was able to speak after restarting his phone. I'm not sure if this is a glitch but please fix it. It makes it unfair to everyone to be in a voice chat and not be able to speak.,3
com.discord,Precious Regine Galang,"Most of the updates are ok somehow manage to catch up with the web version. The only thing I hate is that when you switch in between applications and go back to Discord it would always say error in connection, you'll have to fully close a d open the app again to make it connect well again",3
com.discord,Ligma Johnson,"The lastest update is TERRIBLE. Makes the interface look like trash. How i had everything scaled used to be uniform, now only chat scales up and everything else is too small. 10/21/22 They removed the $5 Nitro option and brought it down to $3 and removed all of the benefits that made the $5 worth it and stripped it to bare bones. Now if you want to stream in HD or have a gif avatar, you have to pay for the $10 option. Terribly greedy business practice. I will never be subbed to Nitro again.",1
com.discord,Bruno Shiniti,"Its impossible to use it after last update, all the UI are overcrowding the screen and now i cant even change people's volume without struggling or when someone are sharing screen Edit1 - after update, the voice channel im in keeps flashing continuously and no bugs were fixed Edit2 - New updates, no bugs fixed and more bug appearing, now I hear an extremely loud sound every time someone enters or quit a call even when my volume is low",1
com.discord,TrueWeebNoShameGaming,"Please revert to last months ""update"" the newest set of updates was far from optimized. It was in fact a huge downgrade to the application and made a lot of things harder to use which completely defeated the point of even trying to implement a UI update and the other things that caused issues. Its having a ton of connection issues. Stickers aren't being saved. Thats HALF the reason I sub to Nitro just so you know. So im now basically paying for a downgraded app because of the recent updates.",2
com.discord,Tristan Battani,"Just updated and it went from 5/5 to a 1/5. The new update feels clunky, laggy, and the text itself looks too big and up-front on the screen. App was otherwise fine, worked perfectly before now its just painful to use. Everything feels like it takes too long to open and theres a delay on anything you do.",1
com.discord,Anthony,"This is the single best communication program and app I've literally ever used, it's superior in every way with features not a single other program I've used has, and features it does have that other programs have are done much better in Discord, like TeamSpeak has similar features for group voice chats but it has an awful layout, Discord is so clear and easy to use, and for people who know what they're doing it's ever better",5
com.discord,Angela Linn (Alali),"It used to be a really good app but after the most recent update (September 2022) it has become awful, its so glitchy, impossible to navigate and honestly just difficult. I hope this gets fixed soon because i really like Discord as a community app but it's becoming hard to continue to use it. I know the developers are working hard to fix it but a review felt right.",1
com.discord,Crys Magnolia,"Newest mobile update is very bad. Most of the icons and messages don't load anymore unless I leave a channel sitting open for 1-2 minutes. Using a Moto G Stylus. The previous app before all the aesthetic changes always ran smoothly. Reading comments, it seems others are having this issue as well. Please fix it so we can communicate on the go again ):",1
com.discord,Gold Heart,"I used to love this app but now it's an absolute pain to do anything. My discord keeps crashing, and when I'm on calls it locks up and shuts down discord. I can't put emojis on channels any more as a android user and I can't even scroll through my photos easily now without having to manually open up the albums instead of how easy it used to be. Please, I beg. I hope these bugs get fixed, it's ruining my discord experience.",1
com.discord,Stephanie Tang,"best form of social media in my opinion, though after the last update it became very laggy and difficult to use. my app is completely up to date and im sure to close all background apps. it randomly opens things like emojis and members list, then the send button doesnt show up.",3
com.discord,Dan Pilkington,"Awkward interface changes mean that now you can no longer drag and drop channels to recategorise them as this feature is now buggy as hell. Also, why remove the emoji keyboard for editing channel names? It just seems like a completely unnecessary change that just makes using the app more difficult.",2
com.discord,FelineSheep1982,"last update broke everything, the media viewer crashes often, jumping to unreads dont work, emotes in custom status are broken, video player controls are now stuck underneath phone buttons (home, back,). client sided video compression takes too long and increases the size, so non nitro users may not be able to send a video, remove it.",1
com.discord,NighmareMax,"Overall Discord is pretty solid. I like how discord is in sync with your phone when you have it on desktop and phone. I really like how theirs a bata version of Discord as it solved an issue. Personally I've had this app for half a year now and I have only ran into a single problem that got fixed less than 2-3 months. Love the privacy settings, support system is very helpful, the discord overlay in games very helpful to see who joined or who's talking.",5
com.discord,Maulana Rahman Ashshiddiq,"new UI & Layout very weird and increasing lag currently my phone 3GB of RAM, the previous version was stable and normal, in the latest version the screen often freezes when loading images and uploading images, I hope it fixes like the previous version to support low devices, and plus pls add some option for reduce mobile usage data (data saver) for auto play especially GIF and High Resolution Image.",3
com.discord,Jose Guilherme,"After the update it's been TERRIBLE FOR MOBILE ANDROID USERS. -Please fix microphone detection. Whenever I try to join a call I ALWAYS NEED to change to PUSH TO TALK then revert to automatic so my mic can work normally. -Please fix overall app, it's been buggy whenever I press server functions/options or even user options. What happens: Every time I press I gotta go back and then press again so it can work. -PLEASE fix how fast the app opens. If fixed I give a 5 star. As of right it's horrible",1
com.discord,V,"App constantly crashes in the past few months due to latest updates. Consistently badgers me to pay for Nitro to send ANY files, regardless of them being <8MB. Share function hasn't worked in over a month, and when it did it would constantly increase the zoom of the app to unusuable levels. Obnoxious pop ups all but demanding I buy Nitro every single time I launch the app. Notifications don't appear half the time or are delayed by hours. Chats desync between desktop and mobile by hours at times.",1
com.discord,PapaFredu,Fix the ui and make it take less battery seriously. And I've been having an issue where speech to text keyboard flickers in and out of existence and it's really annoying. It's nearly impossible for me to use the speech to text keyboard for anything in Discord at this point.,1
com.discord,cr33p pop,"been using the app since 2018 with no problems, updated it and now the app crashes when i try to send more than one photo at a time, no matter how strong my wifi/service is im always left with it ""connecting"" for 20+ minutes. and with this update i physically couldnt use discord until i got it. it would never load any messages or servers as well as kick me off the app all together. really wish i could un-update lol",1
com.discord,NightSabre64,"Edit of my review: Nothing has changed! It is still utter trash. UI is buggy and never scales properly, items are cropped off the screen. What's the use of nitro if I can't see all the emoji I could use. None of these updates fix anything. Roll it back to when it worked please.",1
com.discord,Jaden Speth,"Recent updates have made the app a mess. Development has focused on adding features and not performance optimizations/ bug fixes. That is great but it's getting harder to use because of all the bugs and performance hitches, even on a modern device Edit: it got worse",1
com.discord,des !,"great, but the recent update has given me a bug where discord won't show me new messages, sent or received, until i close the tab and reopen. most of the time even that doesn't show me that i've sent a message and i've repeated myself 3 or 4 times because i thought it hadn't sent. very annoying, please fix as soon as possible",3
com.discord,k8ne0456,"After the new update discord is much slower!! Its takes like 4 more seconds to open a server and to update a chat once you open it. Im unable to open videos without it crashing. I only updated discord because I had to because it just kept saying ""connecting"". Update is trash and images take so much longer to upload",2
com.discord,Finna woken,Images don't send. Plain and simple try to send any image regardless of file size it just won't send. It stops at an arbitrary percentage and leave jt for as long as you want it will never send. I'm sick of this. It's been 2 months and it's still bugged to hell and back. I'm glad to hear IOS users don't have to deal with that garbage yet,2
com.discord,Rachel Q,I love discord. I use it all day. But update 144 has completely ruined it. Messages won't send/update unless you completely close and restart the app. Gifs don't work half the time. Pictures don't send right. The new way they chose for the gallery is awful. Just as a long time discord user (both mobile and desktop) this update sucks.,1
com.discord,Randy Akers,"EDITED FOR SEPT. 9 UPDATE All of the issues I described in my previous review are still present. This new version of Discord with the React Native framework is simply not good. Discord folks, I really wish you would just roll back to the last stable Android version prior to this, because this one just is not working out.",1
com.discord,Sebastian Nevarez,"So, um, I have a different (ugly might I add) UI from my friends, this happened after I reinstalled discord due to a connection bug (it was stuck forever with the ""connecting"" banner and I couldn't type anything). My techy friend said it might be because I'm somehow on a earlier version of discord but I think this is new because the dev info has all the most recent stuff. Anyways, 4 stars, great app, weird bug, funny dev team.",4
com.discord,Skadi,"Terrible update, ever since they merged their mobile versions they massively hurt the Android user bass. This client is buggy in so many ways we never had to deal with before. Videos uploaded have their audio become pure static, chat messages glitch and flicker if you are not in the person who sent them's DM at the time of sending. And worst of all message notifications are entirely messed up and mostly never appear for anyone. You can download and older apk for this app and have a better time",1
com.discord,Ivory Raven,"The app is great, but the latest update is absolutely horrible. It made it run super slow, I can no longer use my talk to text, it undid all of my settings, everything is smaller. Messages and pictures load super slow. Please give me the old discord? It was a lot better before the latest update.",2
com.discord,Ezra Sotelo,"10/05/2022 Accidentally updated and that was a mistake. Still slow, buggy, can't remove the haptic feedback. The enter button is too small. Build 126 was near PERFECT and y'all have been a mess since. Took me three minutes to see a picture with the new update, with 5G and my wifi that was 402mbps at the time.",1
com.discord,Rinnosuke Morichika,"The UI is buggier than ever. The icons don't want to load up anymore. Lots of unresponsiveness and crashes. And all of that, because the company wanted to use half the effort by lazily converting their iOS app to Android. No amount of updates can fix that.",1
com.discord,Cacti,"The more I use this app the shittier it gets! I can't send multiple pictures, I have to send one at a time. Pictures send slow, messages send slow.

com.discord,Tubu,"Good on pc. Buw after I updated the mobile version it won't work. I have 6,000 unred dm's that make the usage of the app impossible. I have recieved over 15 differed notifications in the past 5 minutes and I'm unable to keep the app open for longer than 3-4 minutes before it crashes.

I suggest you fix this, even though I'm not sure if I'm the only one or not.",3
com.discord,Tman 25,"I'm highly disappointed. The last update was fine. Overlay for android mobile worked fine. The display was alright. And i generally had little problems. This new update rolls around and now everything is zoomed in and bigger display wise, i cant get rid of other people displaying their cameras now when it never NEEDED to be a thing, the overlay for mobile doesnt show who's talking anymore as well that the mute deafen and disconnect bar is blank now, and i lag MORE than before. Discord.. Fix this",1

com.discord,Shortbread Cookies,It has some issues with bugs and glitches happening since the last it updated. Pictures and gifs are having troubles loading and have to click in and out of the image or stay on the image until it finally loads. Another thing I've noticed and am irritated with is when a chain of pictures are sent in one message; when you go to download many from that chain it only downloads one image repeatedly despite clicking and downloading different images.,3
com.discord,Char and kai,"Everything works except the friend request. How hard I try every time, my screen doesn't look the same as other people's. When I click the person icon.

com.discord,Hatake Simper (Modecris Junior),"Love this app but recently (ever since the august update) the app is just unusable for me.

com.discord,Dyado Popets,After the new UI updates nothing works as it's supposed to. Sharing is broken. Videos don't play. Server settings are broken. Moving from portrait to landscape breaks most videos and images and sends you not where you were. Revert the UI please.,1
com.discord,First Last,"Honestly I love Discord. But the mobile app is terrible. For starters, minimising the app closes the webcam which is incredibly annoying. Secondly theres no reason a webcam or screenshare voicechat couldnt run in a small window when minimized like youtube or netflix does. Thirdly, being in a call massivley reduces the audio quality of anything else currently running instead of just reducing the sound level of anything else running. Like I said, I love Discord. But these are small issues to solve",1
com.discord,Micah DeFelice,Ah yes BUG FIXES nobody's mic is working so fix ur 'bug fixes' now the platform is great but this last update has destroyed mobile discord since there is no way to change your region. Its still good I'm just angry about these new 'bug fixes' ty for your time. Also on computer when you close out the app it won't open again so you have to use the trash web version. Dissapointing.,4
com.discord,Sophie Rein,"Discord has fixed a lot of its issues from the past. Its better at connection than any other call app i currently use.

com.discord,Faisal Mahmood,On my device (realme 3 pro) it just randomly decides to crash right in the middle of a call. This has happened 4 times to me at this point. Also the app smtimes just doesn't want to respond and goes black and crashes. So rating a 3 until you can fix these changes,3

I don't know what the hell you did to break it but the channel reorganization is BROKEN on mobile. I can NOT move my channels around whatsoever on mobile. Also the emoji button DOES NOT SHOW UP at all over WiFi. At no point does GENSHIN IMPACT require me to use my data, and it's even less laggy. Fix it.",1

com.discord,Jacob-303,"It's not social media, but it can be I can be a lot. You can set up bots in a sever to make a game or to monitor it and give you news hourly. You can use it to get all you friends in a simple or organised group chat. It's a very simple but also filling layout design and it serves of a way to share other networks by making connections to stuff like Xbox and Playstayion or YouTube and GitHub if you're a creator and want to show of your stuff online. Overall I recommend this to pretty much everyone",5
com.discord,Varen H,"The current update makes the overlay extremely buggy and there are no longer any options for video chat settings. Forcing your camera to be off when you leave the app while still in call is really jarring, especially when there is not an option to change it.",2

com.discord,Tom Drew,"After the recent big update, the app is incredibly laggy and notifications rarely work. If the app is open for a few minutes, it'll lag so bad that nothing can be done until it's closed fully and reopened. Before the update, things worked much better and the app was fast.",1
com.discord,garf,"The new update is so bad, it looks bad, and i try to use the other servers emojis and it won't let me scroll, and it got rid of my favorite emojis, and its just, no. if i could i would give it a 0 stars but i can't. i want the last update back. Edit: its been a few days since i updated it. It takes me 10 minutes to download just like 5 images while the last update, it took me like just a minute. Not to mention that i lag so hard whenever i try to do anything. I want the old update back.",1
com.discord,Andrew Hermann,"I like the app but I hate the new visual changes and so far with my experience it causes delay more frequently now when switching channels, servers,and dms I've been. Holding off on delaying the update on my other devices but I can't anymore due to the older version now having connection issues",3
com.discord,Kobe Rios,"I suddenly can't send video links to servers or friends? This used to be a complete non-issue before, but now I can't send tiktok or YouTube links to my friends. This seems to be a mobile issue, which is what i primarily use this program on. Quite annoying.",1
com.discord,Zackaree,New update really tanks performance on older devices where the older versions ran perfectly fine. I've gotta change my review from a 2 to a 1. Discord can just crash when being sent messages now. Getting sent or sending messages cripples older model devices and I have the app crash upwards of ten times daily,1
com.discord,Arc1 Media & Design,File size limit on sending files is frustratingly low. Even after purchasing Nitro. Also the inability to ban people from servers after they already left so they don't come back would be an improvement. On the plus side its very intuitive and I highly prefer it in actual use over Slack.,4
com.discord,Lord Magne,"Constantly having issues where edits to messages don't appear, it just continues to show the old message, can't delete things either, the website works fine, so it's clearly whatever you've done to the app, not impressed Edit: Still having these same issues, app is almost unusable now",1
com.discord,IIIRA !!!,Tried to make an account and the buttons to continue are at the very bottom of my screen where I can click.

com.discord,Quiroz Sonoda Masaomi Rodrigo,Updated after time but still feels uncomfortable to use.. when you want to edit to stuff on the server doesn't let you sometimes or when you want to go to settings takes a lot of time saving and the view still looks.. bad please bring back us the old discord view.. all we need is that..,1
com.discord,Waffles,"New update (9 September 2022) constantly lags out and there is always connection issues. Calls also sound horrible now.

com.discord,H The Flower,"it's been god knows how long and you guys have not fixed anything, let alone even give me a response. discord has been laggy and randomly doesn't allow me to see my friends as it's constantly stuck at a ""connecting"" state. and i will not update to the latest version, it completely removes emoticons such as "":)"" and others and replaces them with cringe emojis. not to mention that the style looks horrible on my other phone and images are all clumped together instead of being spaced out. fix this.",1

com.discord,Liliana Buxton,"i wish i could give 5 stars because i love the app, its great for contacting friends and finding communities but i hate the new system updates. they are too frequent and i wish there was options to go back to the older versions because i hate having to adjust to the new system updates so frequently. the streaming aspect could use some work too, audio frequently lags behind and quality is low.",3

com.discord,Dom,With the latest update its stuck on connecting and simply doesn't work 20%+ of the time with no fix. All because they merged with their apple build to save effort. Disappointing. Hard to recommend an app that no longer does what it advertises.,1
com.discord,Miles VB,Update BAD bad edit: now icons just don't show up. At all. There are no notification warnings and images will just go blank. Not only is the update bad it is super broken!

When i was going to hang up afterwards the app froze then it kicked me out of discord entirely,when i re-opened the app it repeatedly made the call sound of joining and disconnecting it did this for 2 mins and i couldnt do anything cause my screen was froze.I tried uninstalling and re-installing the app and everything works other than my DMs now and i cant press the dm button without it kicking me out entirely.",3

Please kindly fix all this issues and make the new update more faster. Thank you",2
com.discord,Lance,"the font and spacing change is bothering me so much with the latest update - im neurodivergent and it makes the app nigh unusable for me, especially since i cant change it at all on mobile. i genuinely hate it. the app is clunkier, the voice and video chats are worse, so is picture sharing. i hope you change it at the very least visually or give us the option to at least unbold your stupid app font. thanks edit: new update and video call doesnt work at all anymore thanks guys!",1

com.discord,Jan-Willem Grimbeek,"Don't hide the send button every time a message gets sent/the text field is empty. It's unnecessary, and it lags out a lot, taking a second to reappear when I paste a bot command for example, so I keep ending up opening the emojis by accident, wasting my time even more. There's no reason why the send button can't just stay on the screen",2
com.discord,TheRooster,"The new Update SUCKS. I have to manually find images to post them, Everything changed, it's like it's trying to be a carbon copy of the PC version and I can't say I like it. The old mobile discord was ALOT better. please fix the file attachment system. PLEASE.",3

All of the images, videos, and GIFs are not loading since last week. I have tried different solutions, but it still won't work. Like what is the point of having a Nitro? Like was it really worth it? For now, I don't think so. I have contacted the developer, so I am expecting for a response and quick service.",5
com.discord,NOAnimations,"New update is so laggy And yes I am on the last version, the new UI looks smoother, but everything feels so slow, sometimes my messages don't send??

I shouldn't have to stay in the app to continue video calling anyone.",3

com.discord,Donovan McCutcheon,"The recent update is messy. Where I do like some of its new features, my biggest complaints are how it doesn't remember my email when I login, the UI is way too compact, and the log out button is stubbornly positioned at the bottom of the screen.

com.discord,John Wright,The app itself is fine. It notifies and ties in well to the desktop app for logins and such. The issue is there is no urgency with their support for resolving issues or tickets. Not sure if they are just swamped or what but there's zero communication or timeliness.,3

Edit: The devs are responding to every negative review of their most recent update with 'Please submit a support ticket' This doesn't help, it just compounds how bad the situation is.",2

I swear they designed this for 13 year old kids whose parents told them how cool they were back when they had a MySpace page.",1
com.discord,T,üòê there is a strange bug where whenever i send videos the audio corrupts and its just incredibly ear shattering static noise. i dont know if it happens on desktop but definitely android mobile. the video sounds fine on my end and in my files but when it sends on discord the audio is messed up,2
com.discord,Erica Schmitt,"Used to be great, until they stopped developing the separate android version. Now the app behaves inconsistently (font changes, losing where I'd read up to in channels more often than not, taking me from notifications to the wrong server/ channel)",2
com.discord,Jebi,Normally a great app but the developers clearly program and test with Apple in mind. They fix things with almost every update while trying to change something that was not broken which then breaks it. Constant loop and battling this app. PC app is fantastic though.,2
com.discord,Shookwave,"I did what you guys have told me. And the upload multiple images bug is still there. I did uninstall it yesterday and restart my device and it only works yesterday, however today somehow it returned after i just restarted my device. Just pls fix this will ya guys? This bug is getting to infuriating and it's much of a hassle if i uninstall and log back in then restart my device over a tiny bug. Like i swear my Discord wasn't like this before until the Oct. 11 update.",2
com.discord,Raul Segovia,"Just awesome. Discord is my absolute favorite way to communicate with friends while gaming, or to just create a space for family and friends to stay in touch. So many options and with works great on my PC, Chromebook, and android phone.",5
com.discord,Gabby Mrtnz,The app itself is fine. My issue is whenever I try and send pictures without going into my gallery it's just the same 10 pictures in a loop. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not but if it is it's truly not needed as a feature,3
com.discord,Nate Joe,"Changing all the UI was a horrible decision and the VC is FAR less polished - It takes multiple tries to successfully tap on a profile icon in the VC to mute them - You have to spam tap the mute/unmute button or else it doesn't react - You have to spam tap the volume adjuster to adjust their volume up and down - landscape mode does not scale in split screen view - Removed the ability to mute in app notification sounds, such as users joining/leaving the VC, extremely annoying to say the least",1
com.discord,CLOWNSSUM,The app would be a 4 stars if it wasn't for the new update. The new update really messed up the off call circle option and now you can only see Your voice activity instead kf yours AND other people. So many icons are now non-existent and you have to guess what button you're reading. The update didn't really fixed anything and i hope this all gets fixed soon.,3
com.discord,Jordon,"Videos arent opening properly anymore and scrolling away from a playing video rarely stops it. Not huge issues. Whatever you do, DO NOT implement that stupid ""home"" screen or whatever you called it on the pc app. You're turning into facebook/twitter with garbage like that.",3
com.discord,Jacob Bingham (UFTS),"Good job at creating a version of Discord for mobile, my only issues are that it is kinda unstable or acts funny with a slow network connection and there is limited data-saving features, it would be nice if you could disable loading images/gifs while on mobile data (or Wi-Fi for people who have data caps)",4

Plus the auto idle feature is just stupid, especially since im actively participating in the chat but still get idle status regardless.",1
com.discord,Utkarsh Dutta,"This has been my first ever exposure to Discord and it has been quite bad. Here are SOME of the issues I found on mobile: - Doesn't let me verify my contacts; says the verification code is wrong - Doesn't let me invite my friends; app freezes and closes as soon as I click 'Invite' - Doesn't let me set my profile pic/customise my account; says the photo id was invalid/couldn't be found. I've reinstalled the app 4 times, used it on data AND on WiFi, still, no solution. Only solution: uninstall",1
com.discord,Maquia,"A kind message to discord developers, I have been using discord for a long time but didn't update the app and everything was fine but then when i updated the app the UI interface is just so disgusting and pretty much unusable, i feel guilty i want the old discord UI interface back.

com.discord,Caleb Yaeger,"Haven't called on it much but it is great for mobile and very refined.

Great app",5
com.discord,Cyndawn Kramps,"I would have given it a five star.... ifff the app wasnt ruined by the new updates. It used to run as smooth as a knife through butter, but now it lags all the time, looks blocky and terrible, and crashes almost every minute. Its a pain to use, but i use it anyway.",3

com.discord,89 ksokd,I have just redownloaded this app after about a year not using it. I recall there being a way to swipe left from the dm menu to access the connected accounts..and I cannot do that. I have done this twice now and it looks exactly the same. I cannot use my invite link.,1
com.discord,Crispy Fritz,"The new android update is awful. Please revert it. The UI and text is a complete eyesore. The app is way slower than normal, making it a pain to switch channels, send messages, etc. It's a bad update. The app feels like a cheap rip-off of Discord now, and it's really weird. Why do you hate your android users so much?",2
com.discord,Lord Valkyre,I've been using Discord for about 6 years or so (Give or take). I absolutely love it. I run multiple servers and have run/helped run many over the years for other Content Creators. It has to be the best social app that I've ever used in my life. The dev team fixes bugs promptly & the update reports are hilarious to read. I also love the integration (finally!) to Xbox voice. Now for my very very few friends on the PSN to get integrated next? XD 5 stars all day! This gamer appreciates you all! ü§ò,5
com.discord,Ashley Jones,"I've been using discord for a couple years now!! It has led me to some of my greatest and truest friends! It's a great place to connect with new people through disboard server groups, and a lovely way to organize effective collaborative writing efforts. PC discord is much more functional - mobile has a few less features - but overall I have never been displeased with the service it provides! I hope you are all having such a wonderful day!!! Thank you for reading!",5
com.discord,Jenny M,"I spend a lot od time on discord. Best chat app out there, even when we aren't streaming out games. Unlike other chats this one can adjust volume on each person. It isn't always perfect. The always skipping back a year when entering a channel sucks",5

com.discord,Annabel Allers,"Since the most recent update for mobile, my status bar is gone. I have NO WAY of changing my status from online to offline anymore, I can't set a custom status. None of that, it's just disappeared on the mobile version. Extremely frustrating. Please fix this!!!",2

com.discord,Danny Beckett,This app has gotten buggier and more glitchy over time. Sometimes after alt tabbing I will only have the sub-section of the server channels visible that I was already on. Only a restart of app fixed.. now it's doing that with ALL my contacts. Hardly useable on mobile at times.,2
com.discord,Squeaky Meow,"New update sucks, keybaord expressions turn into emojiis, cant use regional indicators in anneasy way now since it becomes flags. The new discord notifications take too much of the screen, the new layout is too complicated. Just let us set these configurations instead of auto-applying them in an update PLEASE!",2
com.discord,Joshua Forster (Jason),List of all the bad things: 1. Can't hear my friends on my head phones 2. my friends not seeing me even when I switch to another app to refrance something 3. dropping my voice input or my firends randomly 4. kicking out of discord on screen share frequently 5. Over heating my phone 6. Playing games is a rough experience 7. The feature nitro offers isn't worth the price tag 8. Unnecessary noise with the mute button 9. Video quality didn't get better with nitro 10. It was just a waste of money.,1

com.discord,Akki,"The app was good but with each further update it becomes worse and worse. Images are not loading properly, lags appear and overall the UI has gotten so much worse than previously. All in all I don't recommend the mobile app at all.",1
com.discord,theDspider25,Experiencing problems... again... calls constantly glitch out and when I'm using overlay it doesn't indicate who's talking. Only my icon stays on the screen. (Used to be whomever was talking their Icon would light up) and switching between servers lags the app.,2
com.discord,It's Merchaholic,Would give it a 5* but I was trapped in a subscription. I was able to do a free trial through the app but they wouldn't let me cancel through the app too. I don't have a computer so it was total garbage. Other than that it's great for talking with clan mates.,1
com.discord,Shxurii,"It's gotten a bit better, still a tad bit laggy and please for god's sake fix the mobile voice overlay. it's having trouble highlighting who's speaking and not only that but major problem is it does not and i mean DOES NOT want to send groups of pictures, it's stuck on 50% and it's annoying",2
com.discord,Silent Wolf,"If its not broken don't fix it. Yesterday my discord started acting funny, infinetly ""connecting"" but I was connected. So I updated it and now Discord is atrocious. I hate everything in this update. It feels slow, janky, clunky and uncomftrable to use. Bring back the old font. The text dosen't smoothly appear anymore and just pops up. Can't use emojis for channel names, emojis auto appear upon typing. The start up always shows the start of a chat. Its so clunky and janky. Bring back old discord.",1
com.discord,Devil Fist,"The latest android versions are just the iOS versions, but with nothing changed. It looks terrible and several features don't work now, but apparently this is acceptable because it's been this way for around a month now. Pathetic and lazy, and the devs have the gall to add pop-ups now asking users to leave reviews on the play store. So here I am! :)",1
com.discord,Veltren,"This new update makes it when I tap on a video embed, profile, or anything, it scrolls me so far up.

com.discord,Darkspyre [],"Discord is an exceptionally good chat service, but the most recent major update on android is stupendously bad: actively worse ui and visuals both aesthetically and functionally, riddled with bugs, and the most comically awful performance I've seen out of an app period. What kind of chat program can't smoothly handle you typing? Users are essentially being chased back to older versions with updates doing almost nothing. I actively recommend against using android discord in its current state.",1
com.discord,Kathy K,"I don't know what the devs ate to think that this update was okay. The big change happened several months ago and I've been *trying* not to update this app purposefully so that my experience wouldn't be jank, suddenly I was *forced* to because I was stuck on ""Connecting""! The app is unoptimized for Android now, is slow and clunky, and looks weirdly squished in some parts and weirdly empty in others. It's slow, ugly, and just bad. The discord *made* for Android was much better.",2
com.discord,Eternal boi,"Performance took a massive hit in the latest update. Messages stutter when typing, Images are a pain to send, inputs get ignored due to the over animation, just revert the app or I'll revert it myself, discord. Trash update. You ruined the damn app.",1
com.discord,Daniel Shatters,"It's a fun social platform. I like the video chat option and being able to share your screen is really cool. I will say though after the update there was alot of lag in video chats, freezing vid chats, black screen with a loading circle. Atleast you can still talk though. Fix the problems and my rating will change to 5‚≠êÔ∏è's",3
com.discord,kai phillips,Good experience. Been using discord for almost 6 years and even with the few glitches and small issues with cameras...

com.discord,Derek J,"This version is really bad at remembering which channel/server you were when you last closed the app and will either jump around channels for the first second after opening or bring you to the wrong one entirely, and if the process is interrupted it will even forget which messages you've already read",3
com.discord,MidnightDragon,"So after recent updates I cannot select reaction things, and I cannot see when people use an Emoji to react to my messages.

I've been using this app for around 2-3 years and it's been an okay experience for me. My issues is the really toxic people and the people who dox others. I don't really see the creators banning those types of people especially when they are harassing others. Besides that, at least this app gives me freedom and can also call and chat if you don't have a phone number.",4

It's slow and very laggy now.,1
com.discord,Mason Gauldin,You really need to fix your file upload system.

I can interrupt everyone I'm in the chat with by mistake and it makes me really upset since I didn't even mean to be a burden. I'm sick of accidently causing a mess where everyone is bothered by something I did not intend to do. I am not happy how there is a constant danger in my chats.",4

com.discord,Ace Dragonheart,I would rate discord higher at 5 stars but my only complaint is the support team. There was a time my account got hacked and it took a month for them to reply then another month to make one solution then when that didn't work it took another month to get a solution that did work. I'm grateful we got my account back but support shouldn't take that long. There could have been complications and it's understandable. But otherwise I love them and still use discord.,4
com.discord,Freax Xie,"the interface just keeps getting more and more complicated, it's truly a maze, swipe this click here then here scroll down swipe up and down click your heels and you may find the thing youre looking for. they also keep fixing what isnt briken, why move the status icon away from the name, it does not make sense",2
com.discord,hirim.,"they fixed the gallery issue; now it crashes constantly. videos are sent in insanely low quality (which btw shouldn't happen, especially when i have nitro and am able to send higher mb files). screen share audio messes up all the time and messages are slow to send.",3
com.discord,Michael Woloschuk,"The latest update is bad, its laggy. It almost made me buy nitro because it was so laggy. Did I change my connection? Ya. Everyone is complaining about the same thing. Whatever you guys did made it bad. Even though this is not my app. I recommend retracing your steps to see what went wrong. If you guys fix it I'll rate 5 stats because I been using this app for over 4 years.",5

com.discord,Jessy Scarlet,I don't normally leave reviews unless something is great or terrible but the updates to this have annoyed me so much I feel compelled to leave a bad review. - image selection is now tiny tiny thumbnails. Why? - messages don't load on 5g or WiFi for ages - every time I open a dm it takes me right to the first message before pinging me to the latest causing it to freeze - chooses to not send messages despite being on 5g or WiFi - editing somehow more fiddly!? - text looks squished - loads more,1
com.discord,Matthew James,"I dont normally leave reviews (yes, I'm that person) but Discord is the absolute best! I can't even begin to describe the amount of friends I've made from discord to all the interesting servers I've been a part of. Discord literally does it all.

The team makes constant, unnecessary changes to the app and then has to go back in and fix them with more unlikable features to cover up their mistakes. No matter how many times people complain, report issues, or are just downright disappointed with the app they don't seem to care.

Been using the app for over a year now but here is the reason for the score. -1 star because of the complicated navigation that most of the options has sub menus over & over that it felt like the app experience is inclined to programmers. -1 star cause the only way to join a server is through invite. It would be nice if I can check out other server w/out the invite. Maybe I'm just a very casual user for this app.,3
com.discord,Rose,"Actually I wanted to give this app 5 stars but I changed my mind. Here's why, I have been using discord for a long time now. I had never ever faced this problem. So, recently I opened discord after quite a long time and I saw that there were no signs or emojis. It was like a pizza with no toppings. And it was annoying, So i decided to update my discord and it fixed it but not for long, it happend again. This time I didnt saw any ""update"" button on the play store. So how am I suppose to update?!",1
com.discord,Anisa I.,"The more i update the app, the more buggy it is. Are you even serious? Is this how improvements should be made? Is this what I've been paying for? How could you turn to the worst, really? It was good and fine before you made that one update. Ever since, i can never enjoy discord as i used to before. I am utterly disappointed. This is one precious app for me as it's a way for me to be connected with people who belong to the same community as me. Please, developers, fix the UI, fix the bugs.",1

If it continues I'll keep posting!",1
com.discord,Yan Chernyak,"Honestly it feels like the discord app is getting worse and worse.

com.discord,Vanyel K,Good. A bit hard to learn new features but friends helped. It's not that bad just a niggle. Easier than most apps you just gottan get past that first hurdle and then it's great. So really 4.5 stars but you can't do halves.,4

com.discord,Koko Nat,"The new graphic design makes it harder to navigate, read, and overall do anything. The lack of space between channels and servers makes it harder to navigate, the text showing who's typing/slowmode is too small for me to read. If anything, this design choice makes it inaccessible. It's cluttered! The old design was much more easier and better. Please bring it back.",1
com.discord,B19. John Gabriel R. Reyes,"The update didnt help at all, The same bugs keep happening over and over. Especially the videos, i cant send anymore videos because it keeps crashing. Atleast the app feels smooth but thats all i could see.",2
com.discord,Austin Dykstra,"This is usually a 5 star App for me. However, the recent update has made this unusable for me in its current state! Typing or deleting anything while using it on my phone is outrageously difficult, and near impossible. The UI is garbage. I have to go through a half dozen menus to upload a single picture. And that is just the start of the issues that the recent update has caused! For the love of all that's holy! PLEASE give us back our original UI and settings from before the update!",1
com.discord,Ian Crawford,"Overall, Discord is great, but the latest update to the android version is rubbish. I can understand wanting to unify the framework it's developed under, but there was clearly no effort put into keeping the experience consistent during the change. It's sluggish, the fonts are cramped, and sizing is all over the place. I almost immediately sideloaded an older version (126.17), which I guess I'll be staying on for the foreseeable future. It's sad that it's come to this.",1
com.discord,Quill P,"The newest ui update has made me want to use this app less. I don't understand why it was thought to be a good idea to remove the transition animations between sending and receiving messages. It makes the app feel clunkier and not as intuitive as it was before. The animations make it easier to register that a new message has appeared on the screen. In addition, the spacing between the text has shrunken down. This makes it much more difficult to read long texts.",1
com.discord,Kis√©,"This application is good, I've been using it for almost 2 years. And from my experiences, I haven't encountered many issues, but I hope you could fix the issues when using the calling system, and sharing screen system, so it could run smoothly. Aside from that, me and some of my friends agreed on requesting on putting out a feature where you could view your messages if it's already readed by anyone. I think it was really a great idea for more features! Thank you. ^^",5
com.discord,Shiro Aeon,"Look, I love the app, been using it since it launched. But this new update ruined it. The UI is horrible (channels too condensed and hard to read, font change makes it worse on the eyes). It's extremely laggy, everytime I want to send a picture the app freezes and I get the ""Discord isn't responding"" error message. Also, to send pictures, you shouldn't have to get out of the app and add extra steps to it! It's made it so tiresome and so much more buggy! Please don't fix what was not broken!!!",1
com.discord,Wesley Rowland,"Been using Discord for a long time, but some some reason on one of the more recent updates it just doesn't respond at all to the touch screen. Or some things do, but others don't. For example, I can't swipe and scroll the chatlog. But I'll be able to swipe and pull up the side bar menu. Or I LITTERALLY can't touch any menu option to open it, but I can touch pictures to open them. And it's intermittent too, like every other hour it starts acting up.",1
com.discord,Rob B,"What have you done?! I spend around 8-10 hours a day on Discord running certain projects and this update has made it very difficult to get anything done. It's clunky and not at all user friendly. When typing a long message, the message box no longer moves down with the text so I have to keep dragging it down to ensure I am spelling things correctly, often moving the insertion point whilst doing so. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The app was perfect the way it was.",1
com.discord,Typophobia,"Love the app, although I'm not a fan of the newest update on mobile. It feels different and uncomfortable to use, and certain things are set up differently. Other than that, it is a great app and very useful for talking to friends and arranging things. Update: It's incredibly laggy and won't load gifs or videos. Discord has crashed multiple times due to this problem and won't stop.",3
com.discord,RA Rocksea,"Hi. I honestly liked Discord in general, rating it five stars for more than a year. However, the new update just looks bad. Yes, great functionality, but the channel lists now look super tight and crammed into a small space. I miss having spaces in between channel lists. That made it look visually relaxing and just chill. I can't put my finger in it but it feels this new update looks ""agitated"" visually. Hope you revert it to the original form. Thanks!",3
com.discord,azietsun,You know for a communication app it kind of sucks I can't communicate with my friends. Ever since this update has come out and I chose to update the app I am no longer able to access my keyboard.. I have tried redownloading me app restarting my entire phone and neither of those work..,2
com.discord,Bethel Terano,"The app is really good for socializing, making friends, chatting, and share a whole bunch of stuff. Even close to perfect, I might say. But the recent surface changes are really tripping with me. The mobile version was altered to be closer to the pc look and that's weird, because the old one was more comfortable and smooth to deal with. I think it was already good the way it was, honestly. Now I have to adapt to the new changes again.",5
com.discord,Kisszuperman,"If it's not broken, don't fix it. Now there has been 4 updates in the span of 2 weeks because everything is broken now. Just a few major issues: - App makes your phone hang up, freeze or it will just crash. - Reply feature in notification is delayed, can take up to 30 seconds to send a message. - Playing a video can result in a black screen, only sound can be heard. - It shows I have new unread messages despite actively reading the channel. Sadly there are a lot more smaller issues too.",2
com.discord,Maureen McGuire,"This is the best way for groups to communicate and share their interests. It's not just for ""gamers"" anymore! Enjoy chatting and sharing images, news, and even make calls between members with slick, creative, well designed and feature rich interface. I love Discord!",5
com.discord,slimeapplez,"I absolutely love discord -- at least until this new update. The UI is absolutely horrendous, who the ACTUAL HELL did you hire that thought it was a good idea? The text is inconsistent, too big or too small, and the ""zoom"" function to change size just makes everything worse. The blocked messages button is huge and in the way, there's no reason for it to be such an eyesore! This app is like 200% more power intensive, to the point I get a pop up, when it used to be VERY battery friend. FFS!!",1
com.discord,Lonr1211,"In regards to the new update, I wasn't able to get a good experience out of it. The new UI is fine, but what made me give a 2* rating is from the massive drop in overall performance, the app became laggy, almost everything I tap takes about 4 seconds to respond as well as the time in takes to load the messages, there are also some unresponsiveness here and there, and then there's the video downloads getting you corrupted files instead of working ones. To sum it all up: terrible update.",2
com.discord,diar saleh,"Everything was fine before, but this new update brought so many bugs with it, and for what? To make it look like the iOS version, that's not really a benefit. The only real benefit is that you can search for messages by date, and that the channels are closer together and more compact, but that's only an improvement for some people who prefer it. Other than the bugs the app is generally uglier and feels worse to use, the messages just appear in the chat box instead of sliding up like they used to",2
com.discord,Kyle Averyx,"Until now, my experience with Discord had been excellent and almost flawless, being by far the best messaging application I have ever used. However, the new UI added with the latest update has completely ruined the app for me. The new interface feels very uncomfortable, the new fonts and scale are hard to get used to, and most importantly for me I'm experiencing performance issues, with the app running slower, and movement being way less smooth. Please, bring back the old UI.",1
com.discord,Ashley C.,"I've been using discord for the last seven years now, and I've never had anything to say about it til now. I don't know who thought it was a good idea, but this overhaul for Discord's UI is awful. For some godforsaken reason, all of the text has undergone inconsistent size changes. It's awful to look at the mishmash of some text thats too big, and some that's too small. It takes longer to load than ever, the animations and status visuals are broken, and it's never been clunkier to use.",1
com.discord,Vovka11,"Honestly, Discord doesn't feel horrible, tiny and clumped. The new interface and features are pretty good, apart from the new role and permissions change menus. However, there are tons of bugs that don't always bother me, but when they do, they're a great annoyance. Also, advice for everyone who feels that the UI is too small - just change the font size, it's that easy. Do a little more research before writing a hateful review.",4
com.discord,bill,"Hey!! I really like using Discord on my phone, but the update made some things a bit buggy. I can't send more than one image at a time (it says the image file is too big though I checked and it's not), sometimes things lag out, and sometimes Spotify doesn't show up on my profile (and a few little other stuff). But hopefully the team can fix everything!! Thank you.",4
com.discord,Kruthi V,"I love the app! However there is always place for improvement, the calls aren't smooth, i wish this would be fixed. When you're editing a server it feels very messy and complicated, but it's fine once you get used to it, other than that, amazing app! There are plenty of great options that aren't available in other communication apps, would recommend",4
com.discord,ijsKoud,"Ever since they ""enhanced"" the experience and made everything ""faster"" the app has been the worst it could possibly be. Loading times are horrible compared to the old version, there is a chance that the loading overlay stays on top of the loaded items, the almond theme is broken on the sidebar which makes it a lot harder to see things. All in all, no improvements made. Edit: they didn't even have the ... to respond to my emails. Horrible service!",1
com.discord,TSM Productions,"Not sure whats going on, but my Discord seems to be suffering from a few glitches and bugs that nobody else seems to have as of right now, such as channels disappearing, or in some cases they are just completely blank. Lag has gone up despite nothing running in the background, and some messages seem to appear in places they shouldn't be. Normally, this wouldn't be too much of an issue for me if it was a mild reoccurring glitch that could be fixed with a simple reset, but this time it's constant.",2
com.discord,Ryou S (Raditya Fachriansyah),"The new layout and interface seems okay, but it has a lot of bugs that appears in the current update. The spacing between channels are very tight, and spacing text is too wide I think. Some of videos are showing only black screen, but the sounds still playable. Also GIF forced to stretch, you have to tap the image to see the full image. Text size doesn't synchronized with text field.",3
com.discord,Mofazzul Hussain,"The latest update is dreadful. It made everything look irregular and abnormal. The fonts became extremely small and it makes it the whole entire app feel cheap and unrecognizable. The update makes it look specifically like the PC version, which I absolutely hate. Above that, it made the app slow and it constantly tells me that the app is not installed when I attempt to open it on the home screen. Can you please add an option in settings to keep the old style of the app.",2
com.discord,Tharisfal,I dislike the update. Numerous animations I can't turn off or make fast enough -- such as the new and annoying animation for new DMs. A dozen ways the behavior is slightly different and worse. On PC: I still don't have any good way to view more than 12 severs at a time on the sidebar and I have to remember the icon of each server. Just give me a text list. I have more than enough horizontal space on a PC screen for that to fit and it would take less vertical space.,1
com.discord,Spatula McGee,"Amazing until the last update. It makes me want to throw my phone against the wall. Not only is the update not very aesthetic, Discord no longer feels fluid to use and there is a delay every time you click on something. I can ignore the superficial aspects such as the text being clumped together (despite it feeling like the graphics have now pushed discord 10 years backwards in time) but the fact it is no longer smooth and friendly to use is a huge blow for its users.",2
com.discord,Gosia Lu,"What have you done in the last update? The app is constantly crashing. The channels are disappearing. Emojis from other server are sometimes working, sometimes not. The app worked perfectly before, this is absurd. Not to mention that it has updated on it's own (thanks Google) and I cannot go back to stable version. Never before I wished there were was a zero stars rating.",1
com.discord,Abi,"I feel like discord likes to get progressively worse. The new update is horrible and not practical at all. Firstly, the size of words are hard to read. Secondly, the new layout of the DM is not practical. To send photos to someone you have to press multiple things scroll down but now they don't show all the pictures and make you go another route to get to the picture you want. Takes too much time and is useless. It is buggy, crashes more. If I could uninstall an update I certainly would.",2
com.discord,Sophia Carneiro,"I love the app, I've been using it for years but the new update is slowly turning me insane. I hate it so much. My phone always freezes, it requires even more storage than before and it kicks me out of the app for no reason. It's also been harder to pick out emojis & emojis from other servers don't work. I've never experienced any of these symptoms and my phone isn't slow at all. Please change it back to how it was, I'm really disappointed.",1
com.discord,Motionxs,"Edit: Nah I can't do it anymore! Everytime I try to type, the app crashes. I have been using discord for a long time, but now I can't even go online and contact my friends without any issues. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî After the recent updates, I can't use the app properly. Everytime I use the app, it crashes. I'm not sure if this is because of my device, but before those updates got released my Discord didn't have any problems. The features that are added are very useful, but I hope it'll be less laggy.",1
com.discord,Carton,"As of the date I am posting this discord has just released a major update to the app, which includes a ton of visual changes. Unfortunately, these visual changes all suck. the app now randomly compresses images to the point they are unviewable. The image viewer is incredibly buggy to the point it is impossible to manipulate images without the viewer breaking, and the interaction menus when you tap and hold on messages are buggy and dont work half the time. Discord, just get rid of it.",1
com.discord,JxeD,"The newest update made things a lot more difficult for me. I like the more compact look, but the app just feels so laggy and clunky to me now. Every action feels delayed by 1/2 a second, whether it was sending a message, opening up files, or even switching servers. It does look nice, but there's too much lag and issues that need to be fixed.",3
com.discord,Intricate,"The new update is absolutely horrendous. On the old one you can switch to other tab for at least 10 seconds before you'll get the ""connecting"" on top of the app, even then it only takes few seconds to reconnect, but now you can't even go to your home screen and back to the app in a milisec before it'll show the ""connecting"" for 2 minutes and during that time, none of your messages will be sent. Voice call is terrible now too, push-to-talk has loud ping, background noise can be heard too clearly.",2
com.discord,Autumchild,"Not a fan of the new UI. Having the panel pernamently next to the chat log in horizontal view is just in the way when reading conversations, and things have become more difficult to navigate when something needs to be adjusted in any form of setting. I understand what was going for here, but I think customer feedback may help with improving the layout for all mobile devices.",2
com.discord,Amon Rem,"Lowering my score, this is terrible. Laggy, glitchy interface that shows up only on half of my screen. Photos mix with each other. Videos pretty much don't play for me, I have to open them in browser when I never had to do that before! The difference between the font size in chat and box where you write is jarring. And when I get a new message, I have to exit the convo and come back to make the notification disappear. Once again, just please revert this. I wish I never installed the new update.",1
com.discord,Issy C,"Every major update makes this app so unusable, the constant small changes are extremely unnecessary and more bothersome than good. Newest update is so clunky, and it's impossible to even reorder text channels and such anymore. I had to go onto the computer to change the placement of a single channel. It's a good app, but the updates just keep making it uncomfortable everytime they happen. If you want to make a big change, at least give us the option to opt out.",3
com.discord,Mikha F,"The new graphic overhaul is absolutely garbage. Not only that it breaks many GIFs, Channel names, animations, etc, but it also cause a lot of lag. Changing status, profile picture, bio, etc now takes 5 minutes the least, which is unacceptable. Seriously, this might be one of the worst(if not the worst) update they brought in a very long time. What a shame.",2
com.discord,eeveetheawesome1,"I absolutely hate the appearance that came with the new update. Ugly and totally unnecessary. Everything looks and acts differently and it's extremely stressful and pointless. It makes texting incredibly difficult as well, with the updates to the keyboard. Images are incredibly and unnecessarily smaller now, which makes viewing multiple images a useless hassle, and, with how small most of the images are, finding them has now become increasingly harder, as the size makes them hard to spot.",1
com.discord,DeadReflection,"I've always loved this app. Have had some issues with lag etc in the past, but never enough for me to hate it. the app automatically updated to the new version today and now I can't even join voice calls at all, it shows I'm in them, but the app crashes every time I open it and people can't hear me when it does get the chance to stay loaded. I hope this does get fixed soon as the main community I'm in is mostly centered around being in calls with friends.",3
com.discord,Sophie Vaughan Evans,"Since the latest update, the spacing and font are strange, the banners when you get a message are far too big, the cursor in light mode is too pale, when I try to attach a photo, I can't see the preview any more so it takes longer and it's easier to attach from the gallery app. It's awful. It changed over night and I thought doing the update would fix it but it didn't. IF YOU'RE ON ANDROID, DON'T DO THE UPDATE",1
com.discord,Joel Heappey,"This new update has ruined the application. The new font size is tiny, the new layout is difficult, but this could be easily solved. The bigger problem is the way the application functions now. It runs slowly, notifications fail to display, channels do not update unless the application is opened. Please revert this to the previous version of the application as this is a terrible experience across the board.",1
com.discord,Stickmanamong M,"I have an experience on Discord mobile for over some years the new update is horrible. It changed everything I got used to the old one. I hope you can change it to the old one aswell. Too much bugs, layouts , opening style , I can't even see if the person is typing or not, when I send a massage its not even sending it animated style, so disappointed. Thank you for reading.",1
com.discord,Henry Davis,"The new update comes with a new layout, soome cool new features, and a lot of bugs! It almost feels like discord didnt test the update before releasing it to everyone. The bugs are super frustrating as well, not just little things that you can ignore. A good idea would be to roll back the update, until it is ready for release, instead of leaving it as a buggy mess!",1
com.discord,Trolo,"The last update ruined everything. The old design of the app was very easy to understand and use, but this new update, really made it difficult for me and for many others. The design is terrifying, the app navigation is awful, and all this comes with bugs and extremely slow app navigation. The only good thing is that a few freatures from discord web were added, but nothing else. It would've been so much better if you kept the old design but added the few things that are actually useful.",1
com.discord,VAnomalice,"Discord is a very good messaging service. It deserves 5 stars. But not yet. Not until this really crazy glitch gets fixed. Sometimes images you can send are displayed as other images, even ones that are no longer on your device and that has resulted in me sending the wrong images to people which is really embarrassing. You have to go into settings and clear the cache for discord, and I don't really think you should have to do that. My rating will change if it is fixed. (I use an android phone)",2
com.discord,Gaille Anne Bordonada,"This update absolutely sucks. The UI looks cramped, and the app has become so laggy! My messages aren't sending as quickly as they used to. Sometimes they don't even send at all! I have to exit the app, clear the cache, open it again, then retype the message that I wanted to send in the first place just for it to go through! Please rollback the update!",1
com.discord,Riell Marvel,"This app has officially hit rock bottom, I have never seen an app become this bad in a single update. It removed key features that I loved about it, but not only that, loading times increased by a large margin, moving from one channel into another will cause the app to glitch out. And when you open the app, it's more than a 50% chance of your app getting stuck in the ""Connecting"" phase. Same with messages, even if your app did load in it's not even guaranteed to that your message is gonna send.",1
com.discord,Helena Lopez,"Looks better but at the cost of performance. I can't upload images since they don't show up at all (maybe because I have too many?), ever since the update I have to upload them with the share tool. It worked without issues before the update. Also I have to constantly close the app since it takes ages to reconnect, it's easier to just close it than wait for it to connect. Will offer more stars once those issues get fixes.",1
com.discord,Zodman Zod,"This latest update is absolutely awful. The fonts, appearance and channel layouts are so hard to see. It interface was much better before this update. I can't even see the channel headings anymore, uploading pictures, photos is very unpleasant as there's no preview like before the update. I wish there was a way to revert back to the older version. Everything was fine before, now you guys have made discord a very unpleasant experience.",1
com.discord,Avros Kyargath,This latest update is a huge step backwards in usability and functionality. Message notifications are not coming through unless the app is open even with settings to have them alert outside of the app. The text is much smaller and harder to interact with. Images and channels will not load for extended periods of time. Reopening the app from standby after an extended period of time will cause it to reconnect as if it had no internet connection. Please go back to developing an Android native app,1
com.discord,Daniel Thorpe,"This update is the worst that's been put out in a very, very long time. Connections seem to have somehow gotten even less reliable than before, even on WiFi, the fonts are terrible, and moving away from Android design language is extremely jarring. Simple features like highlighting messages when holding them are gone. The android app has been getting steadily worse as you try and bring ""feature parity"", you should be bringing the other apps up, not regressing the android app.",1
com.discord,shadyy,"The app itself is amazing, but the new update is just awful. Other than the odd layout and increase in size of font, there's some downsides when on video call on mobile. Our cameras turn off when we leave the app or turn off the device, which I really don't like because I want my friends to still see me when I'm on another app. I really want the old layout and call back, because this is really just not it.",2
com.discord,alina,"great app, i've used it for a few years without problems. the newest update made everything feel laggier though. there are a few pros to it, but for example playing videos will just straight up not work sometimes. the whole app will freeze while the video is loading, which forces me to restart it. there are other pros and cons but the ""updated"" video system really does not work, i dont see why it needed updating.",3
com.discord,Gideon Jamala,"I like it but i have some issues mostly with the search function. Firstly it's not as detailed as the desktop app, you cant filter by date (and some other options). And secondly, when you do search you have to manually scroll down the list. The side bar can't be used to help you zoom by quickly. After you do click on a search result and jump to it, if you go back to search results, it starts back at the top of the list, meaning you have to start manually scrolling all over again.",3
com.discord,Ravioli Macaroni,"The apps interface and overall usability is terrible now. I can't tell if I'm muted or not and I also can't hear the stream's audio when my friend is sharing their screen. I hope you'll bring back the old interface and make the stream's sound dependant on the volume of phone's medias again. As of now, my rating is going to be one star but if I could, I would go even lower. My rating won't change until the app goes back to normal.",1
com.discord,rkikun,"I've used discord for many years. I've witnessed it go through format changes before, and often have just adapted. There are some features that I'm not happy with though.. Like the shortcut calling icon, I know it sounds strange but it helped me to see it flash between the person speaking. And it's kind of broken? You can still click certain things but it just... doesn't work properly? And I've reset my wifi, did whatever I could but it just seems to be part of the update. Format needs work.",2
com.discord,CursedFunk,"the new update looks worse than before, it's hard to navigate through than the earlier version. - I'm not exactly happy with this sudden change, simplistic is good, but this looks cluttered and rushed or trying to be something modern than it is. - the old look was good enough, you're making discord inaccessible for those with vision problems or more. - And the in discord notification, safe to say I'm not a fan of that function nor what has changed.",1
com.discord,katie holland,"I use discord alot and today it's all changed since an update and I don't like it. It's all spaced out weird, it's all glitchy and not running smoothly at all. My phone switched itself off twice in the space of 2 minutes whilst using Discord due to overheating. I was only chatting! So I've been unable to use it. I don't know what you've done to make it overheat my phone so much but please fix! Samsung S20. Edit: yes app is up to date. Update is what caused the problems.",1
com.discord,Laser _,"Everything about the app is completely destroyed. The UI is really unappealing, as everything requires more time to. Simply opening up an image and zooming in doesn't function good anymore. Videos auto pause when scrolling, and don't turn off when you leave the channel. Lastly the keyboard gets stuck and refuses to go back to normal. What kind of update is this? The old app was far better",1
com.discord,Ashe Grey,"seriously how did this latest update get out of beta app is consistently slow. frequently, it will freeze for a second or so when changing channels. a few times a day it will be unable to change channels, showing the same one regardless of what is clicked, and will require a restart. new share dialogue shows only one contact - the most recently used channel. searching fixes this but where there used to be a list of recently used channels there is now a void of white space. the list goes on.",2
com.discord,Red Robin Rose,"This new U.I update is pure garbage. I need text to speech half the time and I had no issues with it before this update. It only doesn't work on discord. You can't send images compressed anymore, it doesn't give you the option. The U.I is squished. It is so glitchy and laggy. I'll open a chat and the new thread up will pop up for no reason. I'll get a message but it won't actually show up until 5 to 10 minutes afterwards. I've had to restart on multiple occasions. Gifs are black. Awful.",1
com.discord,Gacha_ FoxieEdits,"This app was amazing before, there were a few minor bug issues but other than that it was great. Although the new UI update is horrible, I agree with everyone else. The font is changed, everything is too spaced together, it honestly seems a bit stiff to move around (if that makes sense). No one likes this new update. Some of the channels in my Discord server almost seem to be glitched out and squished. Please go back to the original, everyone agrees. This app went from 5 stars to 1.",1
com.discord,Don,"This is specifically aimed at whatever the new UI update is, because it's horrible, clunky, and extremely laggy compared to the regular UI, whether it's typing or switching channels/servers it feels a lot slower. I do however appreciate some things such as the search bar filters that are present in the desktop version and the new settings features that as far as I'm aware, were only available in the IOS version. In other words, please change the UI to what is was, pretty pwease üò≥",1
com.discord,Kris Fuller,"New update has made the mobile versions of this app lazily done. Even if the app is closed, it will show you as idle most of the time, so you will miss messages. I have the app on my laptop and it works perfectly fine. But they've gotten really lazy with the mobile versions, there isn't nearly as much effort put in and you can tell. Also some of the ways the interface has changed on mobile makes it look so unpleasant. Older versions of mobile discord looked and worked so much better.",2

So: my own statuses don't work (people can't see them), the button to save your status is just an ""S..."" at the top right, the emojis in the statuses are replaced with bad crops of the phone's default emojis, the ""quick"" gallery doesn't show thumbnails or let you select and send images, so I have to use the file explorer; and the emoji reserved words are no longer highlit, thus harder to distinguish. None of this was broken before.",1
com.discord,Rio Bunting,"Please change Discord back! It is up to date and all my settings are correct but it looks awful with the new update!

com.discord,Auburrito Boi,"I love using discord and I've been using it for years. But besides the new notification settings that pop up over apps and the chunky text layout, my biggest problem with this update is that calls are very laggy now. The voices in call are fine, but when I try to mute, to leave, to have my cam on, and any other function, the app would freeze for a while, and either work after that or crash. I'd also like to have the old vc overlay where it shows who talked instead of just whenever I talked.",2
com.discord,Ren√© Pendragon,"The new update is not great. I know a lot of people don't like the way it looks (I am also one of them), but the biggest problem for me is just that the app does not work well anymore. The pictures take so much to load and when I try to send them, it's just not happening, I just get ""Compressing files --0%"". The ""Connecting"" part of things when opening Discord takes much longer. Video calls don't work well, I had to hang up and come back so many times.",1
com.discord,Manoj Patil,"It's literally the worst update (Discord Mobile) I've ever seen. The UI looks so bad. The channels look so clumsy and congested. The images sent are either vertically half cropped or horizontally half cropped. in order to reply or react to messages o have to click on the message 3-4 times for it to work . It's so bad. I just wish we could get back to the previous version. If this continues happening, i will have to uninstall the app and look for alternatives. Please look into this.",1
com.discord,Ausca White,"It was a five, but the new update is sorta...eh. The layout changed way too much in an unnecessary way- I preferred the old layout. The new one caused me too much stress, and if it weren't for the friends I had made, I would've deleted the app out of frustration... maybe you could make the layout thing an option in the settings? So those who want to get the old layout, and those who dont can get the new one? Also the in-app notification is stressful now, the blue bar is pressuring.. and it lags",2
com.discord,Sauc,"After the latest update, the app has become very slow and unresponsive. When playing videos, if any slight movements happen-including new messages from other members, will stop the video from playing. There is a 3 second delay when making an action in the app, which includes sending a message, opening the emotes for the server and switching channels. This update has been a direct downgrade of both its previous version and the PC version of Discord.",2
com.discord,Licia H,"After the most recent update, the app has gone downhill.1.Mobile Voice overlay is absolutely broken, as it doesn't show/light up with who is speaking in the server anymore (Just shows when you are speaking).2. Mobile Voice overlay also does not show the 3 buttons(audio output, mute, and disconnect buttons)when pressed. It does work when you push it, but the buttons itself is Invisible.3.When adjusting peoples volumes in a channel, it bugs out and doesn't work, unless you swipe up fully. Thanks.",1
com.discord,Bruno Schakir,"Discord... I'm all for getting new features, but you can't just make the app worse alongside the new features. For example, the delete button has changed position and the actual deletion of messages feels really clunky now because of the stupidly big ""Are you sure?""-box. Also, the scale of everything is so odd right now: the channel menu is small but the scale of the chat is stupidly big. These are some of the annoyances, just to name a few. Something just feels wrong about this new design...",1
com.discord,Ezra Noah Lux,"I have used Discord for years. The latest UI update has made the app unusable + inaccessible. I can't sort channels on servers with any kind of ease anymore, the condensed messages are difficult to read, the lack of space between channels make it difficult to select the right one, the line spacing in messages make longer texts difficult to read, & the animation change has removed a lot of what made Discord an appealing alternative to other messaging services. The app is now simply inaccessible.",1
com.discord,Sofie Leo,"The recent update is catastrophic. As many already said about UI I thought I will get used to it, as it's closer to the desktop version. However, new message notification doesn't go away even after reading. Videos playing from other servers, while you are in DMs. Voice doesn't connects to the call. After phone call, can't connect back to discord call, it keeps kicking from it and closing the app. App randomly stops responding, first time in years of using discord on phone. Very disappointed.",3
com.discord,KittyCatChan Jamesy,The App was good. But the recent update changing the font brought so many bugs and issues. It's not as good as it used to be and I hope the either fix it or revert the changes. Some bugs found: -Writing long messages doesn't move the message box so you have to move the chat box down THEN reclick at the end to get the text back. -Wanting to send mass images from gallery makes the text get smaller and smaller and smaller until its tiny. Would add the rest but no characters left ;~;,2
com.discord,Vasiliki Malik,"The new update (August 2022) is awful! From the bad layout, the spacing, how small everything is, the fact that the camera turns off by itself when in a videocall and you leave the discord app, the app is now so buggy and laggy and runs slow. Bring back the old version! You'll lose a lot of users! If I didn't necessarily need it, I would have uninstalled after this update but unfortunately, it's mandatory I have the app. Hopefully, they will listen to the people and their opinions!",1
com.discord,Quinn,"New update is terrible. Everything is noticeably slower, as in the animations are unnecessarily longer and the performance of the app is worse. The new image picker is truly awful. It's slow, you can't send documents, and the picker is no longer infinite so forcing you to your photos app if you want something more than 50 images ago. You can no longer see a file name of an image when you fullscreen a message. It no longer offers to compress my images either forcing me to send one at a time.",1
com.discord,Kronix_TexYT,"Used to be really good. And then the update came out. I tried the beta before but uninstalled it because it was harder to navigate with longer waiting times to change channel and send text, etc. I wanted to stay in the old update, but stupid me left auto-update on, so I'm stuck like this. And what makes it worse is requiring slash commands for bots. These two ""features"" makes it a lot worse than it was just a few weeks ago. Please fix the bugs soon!",2
com.discord,OrangeNASA,"The app was functioning perfectly fine on mobile but the latest update made it terrible. I understand there are many different devices and that probably not everyone has these problems, but my experience is that it's laggy, slower than before and a whole lot of other problems. The thing that I dislike the most about this version is that I like to turn off preview images and links when I'm in public but with the latest update some images and previews still show eventhough it's all turned off.",1
com.discord,Grim Rose,"""If it ain't Broke, Don't fix it"" Whoever was behind the new UI update really needs to know the phrase stated above. They have completely DESTROYED the app's look. Not to mention it performs very poorly by comparison. It is slow to register that an image has been sent in private messages to the point that I've thought on numverous occasions that they hadn't sent AT ALL. The notification pop ups are distracting and just overall bad by comparison to the previous version. Please don't keep this UI",1
com.discord,Rhytermz,"Discord was once good before, just because of the new look is unsatisfying and makes every function of the application worse. The previous look is better in loading and sending messages. However, after the update of the new look, I can't load any single message sometimes, but I am pretty sure I have a good connection and it doesn't show I am connecting, it is just loading forever. Besides, even if loading the messages is successful, sometimes messages can't be sent. Please fix this.",2
com.discord,Chris M,"Edit: Latest patch is insanely buggy, unable to hide my touchpad anymore and ""mark unread"" jumps straight to the latest message rather than letting me scroll through what I haven't seen. A great secure experience for multiple people to chat together at the same time, while also providing a platform for everyone to share content. Group video calls can be a bit flakey but the rest of the platform is a very solid, highly customisable experience.",1
com.discord,Sapphire The dog,"Great app! One of the best I've used, good for socializing, making friends, etc. There's a HUGE problem with the new update, though. It's choppy, the interface changed a LOT and it's honestly really laggy. I liked it the way it used to be--it ran smoothly, it was comfortable to use, etc. I would really like if it was changed back, as I might just stop using Discoed entirely. Not worth the trouble.",4
com.discord,Jaime Hallett,"New overhaul update messed a lot of stuff up. Images with a small resolution are blown up to fit the width of the chat, makes no sense. The app icon both in the top left of the app itself and on the home screen no longer show a notification dot with the number of messages/pings, no matter what settings I put in my launcher. Channels/categories are super close together now, leading to very easy mis-taps and opening the wrong one. The list goes on, but I have a character limit in this review.",2
com.discord,JoyTheBoi,"This latest update has ruined the app. The video player continues to play audio even in other channels, and the video itself is a black screen. The smooth transition animations make things janky. The size of images displayed changes at every second and the size of many icons like the online icon next to someone's name in DMs is super small with a huge font for their name. I'm constantly getting stressed out by this all. Please, fix this, quick. I don't want to resort to downloading prev versions",1
com.discord,blake,"this app has always been great, until the last update. whenever i send a message, the way it pops up on the screen looks super choppy. there's no proper animation for it anymore. images are super blurry and low quality in chat, so i have to click on them to actually be able to see them properly. when i try sending a message, it keeps opening up the emoji page even when im sure i didnt misclick. when i want to send a picture, the picture options screen doesnt fit my phone.",1
com.discord,Cyanide,"The new update appears to be alot laggier and slower, not to mention visually it feels slightly weird and out of place. But my biggest complaint is that the window pop-up feature on Android no longer functions properly with this version of discord, that means I can no longer multitask while using discord, which is a huge loss and I would prefer the old version much better.",1
com.discord,Cam. P,"The new android update makes it a terrible experience. I can't even start to name how many bad points there are but just to say a few, it constantly freezes and jumps (I have a well optimised and fairly new phone), you can't see message time stamps, server administration tools don't work half the time, videos won't play no matter what I do sometimes and other times they won't stop playing until I shut the app down. It's awful and I'd rather have the old version back than whatever this is now",1
com.discord,Bryce W,"This newest update honestly brought it from 5 stars down to just 2. All the issues I have seem like nitpicks, but they add up. Like how much unused space there is now due to the font change, especially the names of people you're DMing and the amount of blank space to the left of messages, you can no longer minimize the keyboard by tapping anywhere on the screen, sometimes scrolling just stops for no reason, and removing the animation of moving the conversation up when you send a message.",2
com.discord,Icyloe,"There's some stuff I like and very much don't like in this update, firstly I like how the UI is like from the desktop version now, It actually looks really cool especially in AMOLED mode. But I hate how when replying to a message that's been bombarded by 10 messages or so, it just forces you to go back to the end of the convo, it's really unnecessary since there's already a button in the bottom right for that. I also hate how the server & channel list takes up some of the screen when chatting.",4
com.discord,Luc (LuceoX30),"I hate this new interface, it was fine before, and didn't need adjusting. DON'T FIX WHAT ISN'T BROKEN. Server channels are too close together, causing constant miss-clicks, The font is really unappealing, The overall UI is just too ""mainstream"" to lack any better words, And I don't want to feel like I'm using Twitter when opening images. The app feels like it's become too sterile. And lost any sort of personality that makes it Discord, which was clear being so, for years.",1
com.discord,Redux GB,"App worked great until this new update. There is so much stuff changed that is arguably annoying, like: videos keep playing after going off them, the bounciness at the sides of images, images not scaling, can't view all media in app from the image drawer etc. there is that much wrong that submitting suggestions would take too long and would probably fall on death ears. There was no need to do any of the changes, but in doing so it has caused a long list of bugs and just general annoyances.",2
com.discord,Vidapon,"I woke up to the new layout for this app and... yeah. I agree with everyone else; this new UI update is horrible. Everything is so uncomfortably tightly packed together, message text is smaller, it just does not look appealing at all. Please revert the UI back to what it was previously. It was completely fine before and it didn't need to be changed. No one is happy with this.",1
com.discord,Icefeather Blizzario,"I love Discord, but this latest update has made it almost impossible to use. I've had no issues with the mobile app until this update. There is an added visual timer to notifications (something I've noticed on other phones for years and years now that has never gotten to mine 'til now) which is perfectly fine. The issue is the massive lagspike whenever typing or if a new notification comes in. I can't see what I'm typing either until seconds later. The app has crashed 4 times within an hour.",2
com.discord,Rapha√´l Duhen,"Great service, terrible new app. The old app had its quirks like certain emojis not being sendable. This version however is an absolute mess. Sometimes on opening it will keep starting you in a specific channel of a server. Videos often times don't play at all even with perfectly fine internet, and when they do they way too often bug out and keep playing in the background when coming out of full screen, etc... It's just become a pain to use. I'm sure there were technical reasons, but goddamn.",2
com.discord,Maggie Jones,"I love discord and I use it on a daily basis, but the new update is so full of bugs, the app is barely useable anymore. Not to mention, it feels too much like the PC version, and the only reason I ever used Discord before was because I preferred the mobile version to the PC version. The app is hard to navigate and I'm missing a bunch of buttons. I wish I hadn't updated the app.",1
com.discord,Molly,"As many others have said, since the update the app is much uncomfortable to use,esp. line spacing and notification timer bar. Also, the accessibility options have been reduced which is very disappointing to see as it was good for this before. I have autism and am really distressed by the lack of accessibility and display options now. I really hope the option to switch back is given, especially since so many people have had the same feelings, and I like to think discord listen to their consumers.",1
com.discord,getdustedyun,"JavaScript and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. This new app is absolutely horrendous. It's slow, it's laggy, it's buggy, it looks worse, it doesn't behave like an android app (all gestures and animations feel off). Congratulation, you went from an app that had a bunch of issues but was ultimately pretty decent to something that's almost unusable. EDIT: yea, nah, the longer I use it the worse it gets, I gotta update the rating.",1
com.discord,Anish Gautam,"The new update is horrendously bad in comparison to the old version, which was completely fine. I now have constant connectivity issues, messages won't load or send, the fonts and spacing are completely mismatched and it feels much clunkier to use in general. If I want to use Discord while I'm outside, it often won't load at all, and if it does, messages just don't appear until I restart the app. An absolutely terrible update.",2
com.discord,Karen Koh,"It used to work well no matter which platform we were on. I enjoyed the fluidity of exchange going between laptop and mobile phone. Since the latest update, though, the mobile phone gets stuck on one track and no matter what we try to access, it goes back to the same last page and does not move. I am stuck talking to an individual (on my phone) even though I am trying to tap other individuals or servers.",2
com.discord,Kaye Cambare,"I've been pretty happy with the discord app in general, but since the app auto updated yesterday, I've experienced crashes, slowness, lag, and the features just seem to be overall wonky. I used to be able to have video calls even when I am using a different app; now your camera disappears from the call and your callmates can only see you when you switch to the app. This limits multitasking. Also, I'm having difficulty adjusting the output volumes. It's like the slider isn't functional sometimes.",3
com.discord,Lucas Mellor,"They need to un-frick what has been fricked. The new update is so broken. Since the update I've experienced about 140 crashes with the app. Voice calls sometimes don't let you leave as the red button does not appear, the interface as a whole is buggy and laggy, everything is too compact and squished together, my gifs sometimes stretch out to random resolutions, and when you set a status to clear tomorrow, the status becomes invisible. This is the worst thing they've ever done. Roll it back!",1
com.discord,Mohammad Trad,"I've been using discord for years now. It's a great app for organising information and connecting with people. Feature updates are quite frequent and I've put many of them to good use. Some of the recent features I remember using are event scheduling and channel threads. I'm looking forward to seeing what they come up with next. Hopefully an improved way to display and arrange other content (visual, audio, video, docs). Also collab channels would be cool.",5
com.discord,DudeOnTheInternet,"don't really like the updated layout, might just be because i'm not used to it yet though so I can't do much about that, however I don't really know why you'd remove the function to see more than about 50 photos, and instead make us search through the gallery. personally i found it easier to scroll through in discord. if it's to make the mobile and pc versions then sure, i get that, but don't change it *that* much",3
com.discord,Sebasti√°n Soriano,"New update works bad. It's buggy and laggy, things that I've never experienced before. Often I have to tap a video several times else it doesn't show video, only audio. Audio overlaps with other video's even when they are not shown on the screen. On the other hand, the sharing menu when I select a pic or a video from other app (like google photos) works much much better.",2
com.discord,Bagoly G√°bor (Gaboly),"This new update made this app absolute garbage, lagging, not responsive. And the fact that you can't select multiple photos now and have to open the gallery, because it can't load more photos. The app lags when you open it. And when you get a messgae it shoves it in your face that you haven't read it yet, even though you are in that DM. You are an absolute disappointment with this new and improved (garbage) interface. If I could, I would give this app 0 stars. Use the PC app instead, or the web.",1
com.discord,Genesis X,"I dont wanna hear any of the ""Make sure you're updating the app regularly"" cause I've been desperately checking for those. I've used Discord for years and loved it for all it was. It was easy to use and fun to interact with, and back then Nitro was worth it. Now I cant change my banners in certain servers, sending big images crashes the app and a whole lot of other problems I cant fit in this text. Please change it back to an older version or fix the bugs this update made.",1
com.discord,Chokeyo,"8/25/22 The last update is horrible, the app use way more resources and there is constant network issue to access my servers or private messages. It always took like 5 seconds to just load everything. There is multiples visual issue when you have more than 4 people in a channel on a server. You server folder took more time to show. A huge bad update. 7/2/22 The best. Easy to use, no ads and free. Better than any other communication apps. Nothing can do more than Discord itself !",2
com.discord,Guy,"This isn't really a 1 star review, but it's a mention of huge disappointment with the new scaling settings. We used to be able to fine tune the font sizes to exactly the way we wanted in combination with awful Android scaling settings, but now it's either tiny, or huge. So clunky and I just can't understand why this was changed. Very unhappy about this.",1
com.discord,Kritarth Tripathi,"You can connect with whatever you want. Anime talks are most popular here. Edit: down to 2 stars because, the app consumes data like crazy high. It diminishes all the Internet data within seconds if you stream something. Even when you try to see photos, it consumes very large data. Also, this app fails to sync with the server many times. I opened it today and it was unable to refresh messages or anything. It just kept connecting but didn't connected even after waiting for 2-3 minutes.",2
com.discord,Mirjam,"The new update is absolutely horrendous. I don't know what they did there, but the new UI makes everything on my phone laggy when I try doing anything on the app. And this hasnt been the case before. When I put in a status it just vanishes a second later and noone can see it, but I never removed it. The buttons and keyboard are tiny and when I open photos or gifs it gets super laggy. When Im in calls my whole discord occasionally crashes. This wasnt an issue before. Give us the old design back.",1

I can't use the app properly, even when I switch to Discord on my laptop. My messages were being blocked left and right for no reason and I can't even send a normal paragraph to a chat box without being blocked. What I also don't like about the update is the font being big, the crammed up channels, and what's with that spacing over the words sent. It's hurting my eyes ;-;",2
com.discord,beriont,"This new UI is absolutely TERRIBLE. I really hope it's just because it's still fresh, and it's going to be refined later, but for now it's sooo bad. I cannot see people's profile banners, there is only a loading icon in the place of it and it never loads. In the old version, long-pressing was working fine, and now for some reason it's SO difficult to long-press emojis and reactions, it's painful. Also idk if it's related, but Spotify integrations also stopped working entirely. So PLEASE FIX!!!",1
com.discord,Crispy Chonk,"Updated in September: Installed the latest update, still have all the same issues listed below. Still feels like a downgrade! Updated in August: The layout apparently changed to the same one used for iOS, which I think looks hideous, and pictures aren't showing up right, usernames aren't showing up right, statuses aren't showing up right, I can never send an image at once because nothing will show up. This is all after the latest update and I think it's just such a shame.",2
com.discord,Zoomboo,"I liked discord a lot on mobile but since the new update it's just stopped working properly. Call buttons, online statuses, buttons in general just are not showing up. They're there but they just don't have the asset there that would be required for the app to be used properly. I can't see when someone's online, offline, on do not disturb etc and it's very frustrating. I've tried reinstalling the app but it just doesn't work. Please fix this issue.",1
com.discord,Dax,"What in the hell happened in the latest update!? Font is now much smaller and in turn, harder to tap on when you want to change what channel your in, animations are missing or broken, scrolling to the most recent messages when you've scrolled up to a ping takes forever, and images fail to scale correctly. Oh, and did I mention how slow and buggy everything feels. Discord on Android was fine before, but now it's bordering unusable at times. Until Discord fixes this, I say stay on older versions.",1
com.discord,Calmedian Entertainment,"this app was super good but now i exclusively use it on desktop. the new update is super clunky and everything takes up way too much space on the display. outside of that, it runs considerably worse, has weirdly loud and low quality sound effects that don't even sound as high quality as their PC counterpart, and it's overall losing any ounce of charm it had left. cant say i recommend it unless you have friends you can't contact on other, better apps.",2
com.discord,Kayla Smith,"I'm not the biggest fan of the new ui. The text feels very inconsistent and kinda weird. Also, the sidebars feel way too big and very squished together, especially in servers with a lot of channels. Though, on the other hand, amoled dark mode looks really nice with the new ui and I don't hate how the settings tab looks. My point is the new ui could really use some work, but it isn't awful",3
com.discord,Lester Tan Wei Sheng,"Feels like alot of the UI got broken after the update. When sharing content from other platforms to discord, the UI bugs out and shows icon bubbles displayed with 50% opacity over whatever channel is opened at the time. Super annoying bug. Loading also felt faster before, as if it had stored seen messages on cache or something. But now loading is slower, from what it looks like, it seems it's loading all the messages, new and old, even though you might've opened the channel like, 1 minute ago.",2
com.discord,Metal Invitine,"Recent update for android discord has made the app extremely slow and laggy, and the app will randomly freeze for long periods when sending images or texting. The new update is also missing old features such as @'s #'s and emote's auto highlight when done to show if you typed it correctly before sending a message. Other than this, it's a really good app, I just hope that all these issues will be ironed out and I won't need a phone upgrade just to continue using the app.",3
com.discord,aeyn,"When it comes to the android app, I feel like there's a lot of problems that don't seem to be getting fixed. For example, I changed my username and profile picture nearly a month ago, but it still shows the old info whenever look, which is frustrating. Calls can be quite glitchy, and there are several glitches surrounding embeds, such as videos lagging or not loading in at all. We don't get updates/bug fixes nearly as often as the ios app does, and if we do, it's months after.",3
com.discord,Stampy,"Can you please, revert back to old layout and Ui? this new one is so horrendously bad. I also really dislike the channels being so close to each other. It also doesn't help that, when you use custom emote, it doesn't become blue like the old Ui, so you can't even tell if it will embed or not. Honestly, the more update you did, the more horrible it becomes.",1

Emojis don't show properly in the status, banners don't load... And a lot of other small problems like this that accumulate over time. And I don't know what happened with the font but it's way harder to read. I prefered the old app by a long marge, even if I couldn't do some stuff you could on PC. At least it didn't lag on my older phone...",2

However, recently each new update leaves me more and more disappointed. It has so many bugs. I'm constantly kicked out of calls and the app itself crashes often. I change server and it keeps showing me the conversations of some other chat on another server. It's really inconvenient. The new calls and media aesthetic on mobile is just not it when the previous one was already perfect.",2
com.discord,Mord Behar,"Huge regression with the new update. It forgot all of my app settings. It no longer loads gifs properly and I can't find the setting to fix that. App startup is significantly slower, especially when switching between apps. When switching back from another app it tries to show the default channel, not the one I was previously in. Fonts look wierd. The channel list is completely useless now. Instead of clipping the end of long channel names it's all ellipses. More complaints but no room....",1
com.discord,KLPM 2020,"I'm just going to list everything bad about the update. 1. Serious lag and connection issues for no apparent reason. 2. The font options do nothing. 3. Notifications don't work anymore. 4. Instead of the clean way messages used to slide into the chat they just appear like a cheap texting app. 5. Sending images and files is worse now. 6. Mute sometimes doesn't work. 7. The app will just randomly change my settings. There's a lot more but I'm limited to 500 characters, Fix this please.",1

com.discord,Jason Velonis,"Good until the recent downgrade. Literally, many moderating features on Android are now unusable from how buggy they are, such as sliding interfaces, moving anything or roles. Last ones don't even update as intended visually. App is more prone to crashing, as it is heavier, on both older and newer devices, media takes a while to load. The browsing itself has become heavier and more unresponsive. I don't know how you managed to make it this way from an otherwise standard working application.",1
com.discord,Evie Hembery,"The new update is awful. I loved the previous font, as someone with sight issues and dyslexia I struggle with reading specific fonts and the previous one was an exception, easy on my eyes and rlly easy to read too. The new font, which I believe is just a default one, is stressful and looks strange. All the colouring is different too and the differences between a side bar and the actual chat is little to nothing, and the whole thing is really hard to navigate now. 0/10 update, very disappointing.",1
com.discord,ShawnCZek,"After the switch from a native app to using React Native, the user experience is terrible. The font size does not fit the rest (it is tiny), it crashes on many occasions, new messages stop loading with an unstable connection (this was not a problem before), zooming and navigating images is painful, using server emojis in a text is slow. The only improvement is searching.",2
com.discord,Jonathan Ryan,"It went from being great to being pretty bad after this latest big update. All my favourite emotes were wiped. The font has changed. Videos no longer play reliably and are stuck in a loading loop. Opening and closing the app is slower and just overall worse. Trying to check unread messages is more of a hassle. Used to be you hit the blue unread messages part and it takes you to where you were last. Not to shows you messages in 25 message increments. In a fast moving chat, that's a pain. Fix this",1
com.discord,Ash Wolfdale,"Listen, I use discord for almost four years now and really do enjoy using the app for hanging out with friends. But this new update is just horrible. The screen feels too weird to look at when in a chat and everything is either too big or too small, images and gifs take forever to load or don't even load at all, pings barely show up as well. It just feels annoying to get in the app now. Wish I wouldn't had updated so it stayed the way it was. Please fix this.",1
com.discord,Lamanus,"As of August 27th this app is a mess. With the new UI images are too big and cropped weirdly, the font sizes are inconsistent in messages generated by bots, interacting with messages requires scrolling down because of how oversized the menu is, and the app is slow and has to reconnect when switching tabs, all of these weren't even issues before. The team should have polished the UI and any other behind the scenes changes they did before shipping them out, this feels like a very rushed job.",1
com.discord,xTeodor 12,"Discord is pretty much a great app for chatting, but I dislike the update. Why? Because not only is the app a bit clunky, but also profile pictures of users below their respective roles are cut in half, even the profile picture icons below the user are a bit cut in a reply message. The image and color banners also take a long time to fully load for me. In my opinion, this new software update is one of the worst mobile app updates I've ever experienced, let alone seen them.",3
com.discord,Santum,"A great app to keep in contact with your friends, which has sadly been severely downgraded as of a recent update. They've switched their codebase to match their other versions, but in doing so they've made a snappy and responsive app feel sluggish. Honestly a shame, as it really did use to be quite good. I hope these issues are fixed in the future.",1
com.discord,Ayakashi,"As much as I love finally having time/date filter, I absolutely hate this update. The channels looked cramped and small. This is an application for mobile users, phones are ALREADY small. This update makes my eyes hurt. Not just the size of the channel, even the weird choice of bold and bigger font in places it didn't need to be. I wish you kept the old interface and just added the new features.",2
com.discord,Shelby Dixon,"While Discord is quite useful, and I have used it for a few years now, there's one main issue I have at the moment. After the most recent Android update, it seems to have caused some incompatibilities, mainly with profile picture changing. I upload the file, but before I can save the image, the app does some sort of refresh, which causes it to revert back to the profile picture I already had.",3
com.discord,Fatin Nuha,"I don't like the newest update. I just don't like the look y'know. Give me old look back. Everything's so...bad. Some channels names won't even show up they're just ""..."" That's not helpful at all. I don't like the progress bar up top when notifications come in either. Some pictures and videos won't load. And I really hate the ""Done reading? Why not check out this other channel?"" at the bottom of the screen which never goes away. Like no I don't care about that channel.",1
com.discord,MrOwOofers101,"New UI is cluttered, oversized, jarring, and there is irrelevant boxes of text in certain channels. ""Done reading? Check out #(insert_channel_name)"". Get rid of that. It's extremely annoying and I don't want to see it. Also, holding onto boxes now automatically copies texts rather than opens up options of what to do. Reverse that stupidity too.",1
com.discord,Witold Faro≈Ñ,"The new application is impossible to use on any mobile device! The uploading files/images system is broken, and it requires me to go through all my files to post a single image. The new application is also very laggy, which reduces the comfort whiles using and speed. Also for moderation, we cannot give/remove any roles now. It's bad, as now I cannot rank people. I hope this update will be reverted back to the old application, that one worked without any flaws.",1
com.discord,Stephen Khor,"Their voice call system is bad. Using zoom, Google meet, and even WhatsApp video is totally fine but when you do voice calls on discord (pc and mobile) it's all kinds of problems. Cutting off, low volume etc. Even after you do all apparently necessary settings adjustments to ""fix"" it (anyway it should work well out of the box like the other services).",1
com.discord,Queen Chrysalis,"Amazing app, normally 5 stars. Most recent updates have completely f'd media and caused a variety of issues. If you load a video and back out, it keeps playing and continues when you swap channels and servers, it even kept playing when I minimised the app to the home screen! This is pretty dangerous if you misclick and get hyper loud videos.. Font is also pretty weird now. Only real benefit is the message search shows a preview before jumping. Reverse everything else, then I'll update the review",1
com.discord,Pr3s Ken,"This update is terrible. Everything feels so cramped, I ESPECIALLY hate the fact that if a channel name is too long it will appear as '...' WHY?! Also theres this annoying bug where I'm viewing the same channel nomatter which server I switch to, its so annoying. I have to close discord and open it again but that won't immediately fix the problem, it takes a few tries for it to fix. And finally, the annoying bug where if you click play it will just show as blank but will still play the audio.",1
com.discord,Tony ‚ÄúToeKnee‚Äù Vu,"The newest update ruined the app. The UI looks worse, tapping the newest messages to where you left off doesn't actually send you to where you left off if there were more than 50 messages, loading messages takes a lot longer, chat randomly scrolls up, some people's names are now hidden in a voice channel if theres too many people... the list goes on. I honestly don't know how they managed to mess it up this badly but I hope these changes are reverted.",1
com.discord,Kenny Tweek,"The new update literally won't work. It's completely broken and can't even send a message without crashing, emotes take eternity to load and when you choose an emote to use in your message, you click it and the app crashes. Literally impossible to use, what's the point in being fancy and pretty it the thing can't stand 1 minute without crashing or freezing (and THEN crashing)? On PC, it's the best, on phone, it's the worst.",1
com.discord,Soumyadip H,"With the new updates the app has become completely unusable. Overlay is soo bad. It doesn't show the action buttons, i.e, they are invisible. It doesn't show who is speaking. Also you can't connect with mobile data most of the time. In short don't use the latest version. It's a shame the developers are paid to make the app worse with every update.",1
com.discord,Ahmet Mert Daƒülƒ±,"There's a bug. If I use the share option and share a photo via quick contacts menu, discord will disconnect. it gets stuck trying to ""Reconnect"" until i tab out and tab back in. Happened in earlier versions too. Still reoccurs every single time. It's so easy to recreate. Edit: I've already tried the conventional troubleshooting methods such as restarting my phone and reinstalling the app.",3
com.discord,Bhoomisant Shourya,"The app used to be great before the major overhaul update this month. So much so that it was quite addictive for some people, if not me, to spend their time nonchalantly. Now, however, It doesn't feel like it's the same app anymore. Even after quite a few patch updates recently, it remains unchanged that the app has become sluggish, buggy, laggy, non functional one way or the other. Seems as if all the tries to make the app somewhat ""usable"" again are going in vain. Wish it could roll back.",1
com.discord,Razor,"I used to use discord a lot to talk to friends almost everyday but since the new update it's become not only annoying but sometimes impossible to do even that, the thing it was made for. The screen freezes when trying to go to new channels and I can't even open the keyboard at times since the app is having such a hard time running. Everything is glitchy and there is a lot of lag during basic stuff like typing. Needs to be reverted to previous version otherwise using it is pointless and annoying.",1
com.discord,Connor Morgan,"The new update is horrible. It's unresponsive, clunky, sluggish. The text is now too compact and ugly, some of the functions now have extra steps for no reason, whilst other QOL things are gone completely. A lot of things changed and i don't see any positives, and don't understand why any of it did change. I use discord a lot for my community and its because of these changes that its putting me off from playing and interacting with them at all. This needs to be reverted!",1
com.discord,Jan Willem Baerts,"The latest update is terrible, the interface has an extra pane that appears from the right when you minimize the channels pane on the left leaving with a smaller chat window. I have not yet found the setting to revert to the old interface, maybe it is not even there. And if it is, this feature should be opt-in instead of opt-out.",1
com.discord,Peter Larkin,"Discord on phone was amazing, best goddamn messaging app I've ever used. Then they updated it, the new android update is absolutely terrible. It's slower in every way, the text looks weird, sometimes too small while other bits of text are too big, the font looks different and worse somehow? The UI is terrible, i can no longer send pictures easily. Absolutely terrible, can't believe discord done this after constantly saying how they were for the community and nothing like other apps. REVERT THIS!",1
com.discord,Miko≈Çaj Pisula,"This new update sure is amazing. The old (completely fine) ui was replaced with a brand new, slow, animation-filled, glitchy mess. Apart from that, the file picker is just complety broken, as is video playback (you only get audio sometimes). This is yet another example of discord changing things, that were completely fine, for no reason whatsoever. At this rate, USPS will become a viable alternative to the platform.",1
com.discord,Lara Antiqueira,"This new uptade is atrocious. EVERY TIME the screen rotates, the app reloads, which is super inconvenient when watching a stream. Also, after triggering landscape mode, it's impossible to watch the stream or even touch the settings cuz a weird zoom happens and it stays zoomed until you force stop the app. I really want to go back to the previous version.",1
com.discord,Smudge,"Discord was a great app, it really was. But this update ABSOLUTELY RUINED it. The new UI is hard to look at, with the strange text sizes and more. The verification feature has also ruined the app for me. I was told to either verify or log out, so i verified, and it disabled my account right after! Its really frustrating and i hope it gets fixed soon. This is gonna ruin the app for so many people. Thanks",2
com.discord,Molly,"The new update kind of feels unusable now. I'm not enjoying how the messages keep going to the bottom when I've replied to a message and when I've marked a message as unread. It all looks too condensed and the emote keyboard has strunk too much. It also lags more too. The only thing I like about it is the way that the names are now in bold lettering. Also, it'll be cool if we could write one message and send it to all servers with one click of a button instead of copy and paste",3
com.discord,Aaron Jennings,"Normally I would give the app five stars, but the new update is incredibly bad. The UI changes are awful and everything is buggy. For example, you can no longer just click from a thread back to a channel. Clicking out of a thread brings you back to when it was created, which for some, can be months ago. When you scroll through older messages, the app jumps and skips, almost at random. Forced scrolling to reach newer messages is visually annoying and a massive downgrade over skipping to the end.",1
com.discord,Doinita,"I don't like the latest updates, the font keeps changing to a bigger one randomly/by itself, too much animation with the dms, when I send a photo the gallery tab won't close by itself like before (more time consuming since I have to close it), when I type it doesn't scroll down with the cursor so I have to manually scroll down to see what I'm writing, lagging in sending images (and I need to be fast). It was great before, please change it back. It became so annoying to use, unfortunately üôà",2
com.discord,OX WolfBandit,"Fantastic, absolutely my favourite app to use on laptop. Only reason it gets four stars is the new update on mobile. I really miss being able to hold my phone upside down, it makes it difficult to charge the phone whilst typing without going to the side, which is an unpreferred option. I'd really love if this could be given back in the next update. Otherwise, this app is awesome!",4
com.discord,HD Peterson,"So, yesterday, the app worked fine on my tablet -- it worked like it was on my phone, with collapsible/swipeable sidebars on both the left and right. Today, I can't read my messages because the friends list is in the way unless I go to full screen (which I NEVER do; I work split screen with discord on 1/3 of the screen). Now it works like it's on my desktop (which could use collapsibility & reflow features, too), which sucks on mobile. Dunno what you guys did, but I'm really disappointed.",3
com.discord,Lil,"The new update is really bad. Channels names that are too long just get chopped off to ""..."", how is that useful to anyone? The text is way too big, the emoji selection is way too big, there's no longer any differentiation between text and emote when you're typing, blocked message notifications are bigger than ever (you realise we block people for a reason? no one wants to see that). There's so much unused white space. Font sizes are super inconsistent. Oh, and search doesn't work.",1
com.discord,Gerald Umeasiegbu,"Unfortunately this app can't get 5 stars, anymore. I love the app and have been using it for up to 3 years. Unfortunately, Discord has stopped sending me notifications from Private DMs and it's getting frustrating. I wait for a message to arrive for like, days and, then I open the app only to see that I have unread messages, there. It's quite annyoing especially as I chat with very important people related to me on this platform. I hope a fix for this bug (if it is) will come very soon. Thanks.",4
com.discord,Andrew Welch,"The app used to be extremely smooth. I installed an update yesterday and now it's nearly unusable. It crashes every few minutes, gets stuck in certain chats, and is slow. I'll click on a message to reply or add a reaction and wait 10-15 seconds for the app to respond. The new look is just worse too with smaller fonts. I'm currently on here trying to figure out how to revert the update. It's that or stop using the app.",1
com.discord,Jagoda Sulikowska,When you use this app a lot it constantly freezes and crashes. Newest update makes half your camera a black square when you rotate to landscape mode. Camera turns off whenever you switch to a different app and there's no setting for it. Bluetooth switching when you plug headphones in is sometimes very bad. If you have Google pixel buds discord makes everything go into hands free mode on them and any music you might play sounds awful. If you leave a call it does not switch them back.,2
com.discord,Kolinski Zeta-09,"I've been using discord since 2019, loved the app. This new update now makes everything look off and the worst part of it all is the fact that they limited the amount of files you can see in the send a photo section. Now I cannot scroll to the memes I want to send and try to open my gallery inside the hundreds of folders I have. Which makes me unable to see the picture or video I want to send and it's length. Please revert as soon as possible.",1
com.discord,Shan B,"As always, an unnecessary update has ruined the app. The new layout is awkward, hard to read, and the entire app has become slower and more clunky. Sending pictures now requires you to open your folders instead of just scrolling down, emotes have been reshuffled for no reason, replying to messages only works half of the time now, and everything looks off. I know you have to keep your designers entertained, but not at the cost of user friendliness.",1
com.discord,Anonymous Anonymous,"As a Nitro user, I find the new UI update is extremely buggy, laggy, and slow. Hard to tell if some features were removed or if it's just yet another new bug. Not only that, but it somehow gets slightly worse every update recently since the UI change. I can no longer share web pages from my browser to discord, it launches the app but no message is sent; and when it did used to work, I lost the ability to add line breaks in the edit message screen before sending it. The list goes on. Debacle.",1
com.discord,Raquel -,"The new update has been hell for me. I never had any problems before but now it's ungodly slow, and won't show preview photos in the filesharing option. And when I try to send a picture sometimes it fully crashes on me. The typing also feels much slower and it just feels painful to keep having to use this app on my phone cos the update basically ruined the prime functionality of it for me. I don't care about the layout but if that change is what caused the lag, I do care.",1
com.discord,Emery Gray,"SInce the most recent update, the client has been very.. Clunky. Server voice channels appear smushed so you can't actually see the full list of participants[it just cuts it off after 5 or so people]. The mobile overlay has been broken: The icons for leave call, mute, and the speaker icon have vanished and been replaced with a blank bar. , half of the time when you do leave a call or channel, the mobile overlay persists and won't go away, even if you close the app. Downgrade from before.",2

com.discord,Daniel Fenson,"They keep changing the user interface of the app to the most god-awful disgusting worthless designs, and won't even offer you the ability to opt out.

Please stop. Edit: Its gotten even worse again.",1
com.discord,Utsuhoagie Ryeuji,"New update is absolutely garbage. UI is ugly and cluttered (why do blocked messages stand out more than before? Why are there long animations on popups like we're in the early 10s?). Performance is unacceptable: inputs don't register for 1-3s, changing servers/channels don't load for 2-5s, and when using ""Share to Discord"" from external sources, the suggested channels list doesn't even show up at all. Been a user for 4 years, but this update is making it hard to continue for longer.",1

I try to turn off the in-app notifications but they still show up. And all the emotes I favorite disappeared.

com.discord,David Zysk,Hate it! I downloaded it for a popular game in hopes of learning more about the game on the game's Discord channel. There is so much content in so many rooms that it difficult to find anything meaningful. I am considering deleting the Discord app.,1
com.discord,Rose Puffs,"So apparently the reason why I gave discord 3 stars is that because my phone just broke, I have lots of info on it including my email and discord. I had to stick to using my old phone wich cannot access my discord because I need my email, I had to usemy computer for discord thinking that I can easily remove my email and add a new one apparently it doesn't work like that, I'm mainly asking to add more new ways to log in without any struggle. I'm hoping you will take this seriously and thank you",3
com.discord,Ivan Nikolov,"Overall good app, it is annoying however that 8MB is the largest file you can send without Nitro. The benefits from Nitro are basically none considering the price, so not really worth it. If they implemented a file compressing software without Nitro this app would be perfect.",3
com.discord,June B,"It continuously crashes, sometimes I can't view pictures because it says ""error"" and whenever I try to stop sharing your screen it crashed and wouldn't reopen.",3
com.discord,Ryan McWilliams,"Since the new update this software has been very buggy. Often I will lose the ability to backspace while typing a message unless I click out of, and back into, the typing box. Other times my servers and chats will all disappear from the sidebar (except the one I was in last) when bringing the app back into focus from being open in the background. The other chats don't return until I force close and reopen the app.",1
com.discord,Arne Sokolovic,"The app was perfectly fine until you updated, now the UI just straight up doesn't worm. I just have to rely on memory to know where certain buttons like ""download image"" and ""share to"" are supposed to be. The UI that does work is attrocious, too. Roll back to the previous version, this update is a colossal failure.",1
com.discord,Jesse Waltermire,"After the most recent update, I basically don't get notifications at all. All my notifications are on in the settings of both the app and my phone, but I never get notified about messages anymore, which is kind of important",1
com.discord,Owais,"I absolutely love the new UI (version 145, released in September 2022). App feels so smooth to use now. Although there are some bugs in the new UI which I'm sure will be fixed soon.",5
com.discord,Heather Jackson,"This app is so laggy now. Absolutely terrible. Can't type without it freezing then changing words into symbols because of the lag. If I have discord up on my phone, it causes everything to freeze. I use it as little as possible now.",1
com.discord,A Really Bad Gamer,"I don't know what is going on, but the interface of the app is just completely gone and the app is broken. Only possible thing i can do is send texts and no it's not my phone because a few of my friends have the SAME problem AS BAD as I do. Please fix this, this is awful.",2
com.discord,Shining Shadow,"Discord is the best instant messenger system there is; period. Looking for a subject? You can find a server for it. And if you can't, then you can start the very first one. So long as they remain as open as they have been to free speech, and don't become the nanny state site so many others have, then make sure to use Discord; period.",5
com.discord,Shiratzu,"Was great until the last update. Now mobile keeps having regular connection issues for no reason whatsoever on my end. Wi-fi's fine, discord works on my computer. It's clearly a mobile-only issue, and I'm not missing any updates.",2
com.discord,Jake Djckerson,"Works great, only issue I have is notifications of messages get sent to my phone hours after they have been posted. For example, I'll get 20 notifications from a couple discord servers all at once at 3am from posts that were posted at 10pm.",4
com.discord,Robert Smith,"Fantastic app, well optimized for mobile. My only criticism is sometimes it's hard to see more reactions when you are trying to pull it down. Other than that, little to no issues and is something I use almost as much as WhatsApp.",5
com.discord,ViscousTea,"Hi I would like to recommend to make the 8mb needed for videos and photos into 15mb so your app will actually be helpful for some people that needs pictures thank you because it's always useless sometimes when you want to show something to your friend but you can't because ""the files are too powerful"" even if I crop it, it's still powerful...",3
com.discord,Haggis Helper,"Discord used to be a great platform for the independent, but now that they've grown too big for their britches, they're starting to force advertisement and subscription services and it's just not the same anymore. Edit: discord wants me to fill out a feed back form after posting this review, I'm sorry but I thought my review was feedback enough. Forceing users to fill forms, can't even get a hold of a live body for tech support.",1
com.discord,Sonic,Everything is great. Does everything it's supposed to. And it looks nice while doing it. Only problem I have is that. When you follow a lot of channels/threads/whatever. It's hard to keep up. And by a lot I mean less than 10.,4
com.discord,akaashi iwatani,"the updates keep on ruining discord, now it says that i can't download images and saying save failed and please check settings in photos app. my photos app is disabled, i enabled it and put permissions in, also put permissions to discord, but it didn't work.",1

com.discord,Reed Mayhew,"I love Discord, but this bug makes it near unusable. I'm sending a 30mb video and Discord tried to ""recompress it"" to 120mb and then gives me an error saying ""file too large""? I'm PAYING for Nitro so I can send video files through Discord easily, and now Discord is nearly always making my video files bigger, and then provides NO OPTION to disable it! Please add an option to disable video compression under text and images in settings so I can change my review back to 5 stars. Downgraded to 146.14",1
com.discord,ChillXiao,"Love this app, I use it on a regular basis, talking to my friends. Some groups send videos, etc. Expect.I've been getting put in a inappropriate server just randomly, I have tried leaving it multiple times and I reported it multiple times, but I kept putting back in again all over again, I have tried logging out, Unstalling, installing. Still doesn't work :( is there somewhere that I could fix this issue?",4
com.discord,JJ,"updated August 18 to what I believe to be version 140.16, genuinely destroyed my experience with the app. Before I could rate the app a solid 5 stars: now it's just like the IoS version, including all of the bugs. Most of the changes were incredibly small, but they tend to add up, and actually have ruined the feel of the app. Strange, small text sizes, a much less appealing Ui compared to previous version, and the messages suddenly appearing rather than sliding up is very bothersome. Please fix.",2
com.discord,Butter My Nugger,"The new updates have made it so that videos are UNWATCHABLE, then it freezes automatically and it enlarges a random video and stays frozen on the video, even with gifs the app struggles so much with is that its unusable",1
com.discord,Acetylene,"I honestly wish I could give this app zero stars that how bad it is now. The format of the whole app is horrible. When you click on someone's profile it looks so janky and unusual. I don't understand why we have to change the whole app and the format, can you guys please change it back to the way it was. The design is genuinely hideous and it was 1000x times better before. Please go back to the way it was because these updates have just completely DESTROYED the app as a whole",1
com.discord,Paul Lander,This app is way more useful for group messaging than I would have imagined. It's not prone to lag or strange glitches. What used to require 4 different apps now takes one - and it does all of those things better than the 4 individual apps I was using.,5
com.discord,Galaxy_YuroPlayz,"The problem is kind of getting more worse. The whole app is so slow, the messages takes so long to load and the photos and GIF as well. Please vring back the old Discord that doesn't cause any lag or delay.",2
com.discord,whatna whatna,"I now have a problem. 2 updates ago, my ability to use emoticons was shat on, and now they automatically turn into emojis, it's *really* annoying, I need emoticons back. There are no setting to change this, I don't even understand how I could use emoticons for years, but now all of the sudden I can't. My review stays 1 star until this is fixed, then you can have ur 5 star back.",1
com.discord,Igor Nilov,"Last update broke the app. Spontaneous switching between 3 and 6 photos in a row, up to 10 seconds of delay between sending the photos and actually seeing that they were sent, long time between receiving and displaying received messages (notifications displaying way before message displayed in the app). Along with addition of useless checkmarks and weird design changes. Horrible update. Just roll it back, you'll loose nothing except the bugs",1
com.discord,Kai,"I adore discord, however this new update on mobile is horrendous. Photos no longer automatically compress and I cannot send ten photos at a time in mobile anymore. It is EXTREMELY frustrating to send photos individually when you have a whole ton of photos. I do not like how once you scroll far enough down when looking for photos that there is this section that says ""not what you are looking for?"" And has you press a button to open whatever app your phone uses to backup photos. Was fine before.",1
com.discord,Andy C,"Overall good, but when adding images, the bottom picture selection box just shows the same 10 photos over and over again as I scroll down. So to show images to my group, I need to share from my photo app, not Discord.",4
com.discord,Rita Austin,"Sadly, last few updates have caused problems. When I first used I could upload pics to share. Now that is a monthly subscription. Now with last update, there are blanks on screen so I cant use memes or emojis. Was one of the best newer social media programs out there but it is worsening. Between the mobile games and now Discord may go back to the old social media and home gaming. Mobile convenience costs to use are skyrocketing and updates causing too many glitches.",2
com.discord,Petar Blagojeviƒá (pltarblag),"Desktop Discord feels easy to navigate, understand, and use overall. You can easily type messages and do various things at once. Discord on mobile has always felt very stiff and difficult to use. Oversensitive UIs would pop up when you accidentally slightly twitched your finger in a certain way, making you sometimes accidentally call, or even video call people. The last update for mobile Discord completely ruined it. It is now extremely slow, more buggy than ever, and retains the same problems.",2
com.discord,Francesco M.,"The latest UI update is horrible, I have a compact smartphone and it feels as if now is the spacing is all wonky; not to mention everything lags and switching to the Discord app takes ages. Not only that: once you're inside of the app, it has to connect, then it has to load everything.. by the time everything is ready (and there's also a freeze of couple seconds), the bot I play has already moved past the message that I got notification of. I also have to often scroll the last message up a bit",1
com.discord,Altabalder MaggiGladius,"Why do updates keep happening and messing up with the app? What is going on in there? A while ago there was a terrible update that broke the entire thing; it was fixed over time and the app came back to normal. But now they update it again and suddenly I can't drag windows anymore. Not to say about all the other stuff people are complaining about. Mind your plans, seriously.",5
com.discord,Machi Ch.„Éû„ÉÅ„Åï„Çì,Video and image compression is broken as of the current update. A 15 megabyte video is blowing up to over 51 megabytes. This is beyond unacceptable. This egregious flaw would force someone to buy full nitro in order to send a file that meets the requirements for a basic plan. Not to mention this also is a horrible waste of mobile data resources for people with small data plans. Review subject to change pending a fix to this issue.,2
com.discord,Phantom Button,Won't download on older models on phones and pc. It stays at Pending for ages. I also found it hard to use audio without a mic. Plz don't try to fix things that are fine to begin with,3
com.discord,Roos Oudesluijs,"App now closes and completely reloads chats from a couple hours before. Can't scroll infinitely anymore in both chats and images before being hit with ""load more"" buttons. Overall the new appearance doesn't match the desktop client anymore, with rounded images, icons and font sizes that are all over the place, and even the notification bar being the same colour as the background being something too flat. Overall feels less responsive due to more slow animations that stall the actions happening.",1
com.discord,Kyle S,"Recent update caused non-channel specific buttons to disappear completely. Unable to use any of the UI on my zFold4, having to resort to signing in through ta browser on a different device. 85% unusable now.",1
com.discord,cow raiser Milton,"It's a good app if you wanna Chat with your friends or support communities however there's one huge problem with it, it's the 2fa system it always tell you to enable it in case of a hacker attack so I went along with it and forgot the code for the 2fa and now I can't access my account I tried discord support but they couldn't do anything about it as they removed the feature that regenerates codes through sms so I ended up having to delete my old account and make a new one that's my only problem",4

com.discord,Gayce Of Spades,"Recent updates have made discord basically unusable for me. First, I'll start with smaller stuff. There is a significant difference in size between what is typed in the draft bar vs what is sent, no matter what discord or my devices settings are. Channel names are cut in half where I can only see the bottom of them. In order to send an image I have to go to my system files through discord. I can't even save images without discord telling me something is wrong. I have more but 500 character limit",1

com.discord,Lucas Franz,"App used to be fine, and still works great on desktop, but this latest mobile update is terribly buggy. It pops up with a ""find your friends"" beta opt in that can't be accepted or declined, only backed out of. It only loads the messages of the first person or server that you see... after that you can switch between chats but still only the first messages that loaded will be the ones on-screen. Once they make the app work again, it's a decent messaging/voice chat app",1
com.discord,Jhinius,"The new updates are extremely buggy and laggy. They also removed some features, or hid them under more options. You cannot see your whole gallery anymore as well, which is really annoying, having to either open your file explorer through discord or having to open up gallery yourself to send the files. The app is a lot buggier now, some gifs keep playing even though you have an option enabled that stops them from playing, this wastes a lot of data and makes the app even laggier.",1
com.discord,obama scout,"As if this app couldn't have made me more disappointed as enough as it did. Discord is now having an existential crisis when it comes to detecting file size. I be posting a 3 MB video, and Discord would say that's it's over the limit for non-nitro users (8 MBS). Discord. What are you doing? Fix your app, or revert all of these updates for mobile. They are completely useless and are only just making your app have worse, and worse reviews. Until you do something to fix it. You're getting two stars",2

It feels clunky and feels like many aspects require extra unnecessary steps that the old design did not suffer from. On top of that, the performance of the app dropped significantly, now making the app freeze or slow down by a lot whilst typing a simple sentence for example. Nothing feels faster or cleaner, it feels way too off.",1

The new update has recently made it so bad to look at, even in the AMOLED mode.

Can we just go back to the last version?",1
com.discord,Aniq Arman Edarman,"The new update is awful, the new given UI is horrible. Using the app is a sore to use because of how unpleasant and annoying the app looks and functions. They've changed ALOT of the features from the old UI, and this does not further better the experience. Its janky and the appearance looks incomplete, inconsistent and weird. Whenever I use the app, it feels so slow because how long it takes for the images and videos to load in. Definitely a downgrade from the previous UI, please change it.",2

If they only care about iOS they should just have discord removed from play store and put up in the app store only. Shame on discord for this. Very disappointing on how much time I've spent on this app just for it to be laggy for andoird and good for iOS.

com.discord,Bon,"I have had auto update turned off for a very long time, but today my app updated. Now, everything is uglier than I ever could have imagined. The font size is different from sent messages and the box for typing. If I adjust the font size, they still don't line up. New sent messages now instantly appear rather than making things scroll, meaning messages are more jarring for my eyes and harder to read in fast-paced chats. Notifications now swipe to the center when dismissed for some reason too.",1

The new update has ruined the app and now it's harder to control servers, pms and other chats. But what concerns me the most is the update for the servers, it's very confusing and I can't work my way around things. Making a channel is also much harder now and the roles have also changed. I use my phone to control servers because it's easier but now it's like it's changed to computer/laptop.",2

Now it just returns ""failed to download"" whenever I try. Only work around is for me to open the image/video in the browser and then download it. Everything worked fine before that. Also please remove the stupid nitro gift button that is right next to the image sending button. Why even switch them around? To bait more people to buy nitro? Eitherway it's a stupid decision.",1
com.discord,Anthony ‚ÄúLoLdude107‚Äù Lodato,"It's a good app to talk to friends with. Discord feels like they're trying to make you pay for nitro even more than ever.

I've tried uploading multiple videos and memes that are below 8mbs and discord keeps telling me that there not below the required limit and to go and ""uPgRaDe tO NiTrO tOdAy"" I'm getting sick and tired of it. It all started with discord basic (which honestly should have been the original price of nitro).",2

These updates for the app are extremely annoying and while changing the settings is simple on a desktop, on a phone is anything but.

Yes, there are some good things about it - now channels list is more compact, it has some nice tactile feedback when you select emojis. But they completely broke video and gif embeds.

As the years have passed they have also released many good and useful updates and bug fixes. With this being said as they have grown they have begun to cater to very specific parts of there new audience. This has lead to the biggest mistake they could have made.

The new UIs and everything, it's crazy! But the thing is, most of us including me is experiencing very slow performances, I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing it's because of the app getting every live interaction like the ""done reading? check out <#channel>"" thing. Even if I'm wrong, it could be other background processes that are running unnecessarily. Thank you",5
com.discord,OI Sapp,My favorite app I have never had a problem like I do with Facebook locking me out it's a simple qr code and I'm back. What I do ask of you for asking me for a review is that you allow some way for me to upload my videos even if they are too powerful either by asking Microsoft or Nvidia or any other game capture software for help seting up.

Long story short, as most people have discussed my same concerns, the font is terrible, the spacing is horrendous, there are constant connective issues that I've had, the image tab has been ruined, I can no longer see sent videos or gifs unless i download them, which wastes storage, the app keeps crashing and the update is just overall terrible.

The extreme size is bulky and just akward compared to the previously easy and fast to manuver system, it also has just makes messages less private on screen and when you want to ping someone by name (by tapping their name) you now have to bulky move your entire hand instead of your thumb.",2
com.discord,Anonymous Commentor,"after the update, discord has really been buggy and slow. before you say ""check your connections"" or any other stuff. no. it's your dev's incompetence that has caused this issue. i will not renew my nitro till this issue is fixed and I recommend people to do the same.",1
com.discord,Allen Kennedy,"Pretty good app, I like scrolling memes, but I don't like the fact that they share private conversations with American intelligence agencies without being asked. As in, they actively monitor private conversations, and then send whatever they deem suspect to the relevant authorities. Besides that, app is nice, very fun.",2
com.discord,Aanuoluwapo Ojewuyi.,"This is currently the most irritating app on my phone. The thing keeps freezing when I try to log in. I forgot my password, and tapped on the forgot password button, and then the screen went white for over five minutes. What in God's name is that, even!?? Y'all need to fix this. I need this app for work!",1
com.discord,Mike Le,"Fun community but the app is so unintuitive in many ways. One of the stupid problems is that in a chat with many images, once you tap on one image to inspect it, whenever you back out, the app always try to load the latest messages first. Why don't it just stays at the same spot?! Really hard to read a long chat. So not great experience.",3
com.discord,Rhys Budd,The best way to get in touch with your friends and find new friends that are interested in the same things you are by joining servers that relate to the thing you like.

com.discord,Tobias Rex,"Discord is a good app, don't get me wrong, though there are afew glitches which can be very annoying. One; Deleting images on some phones will cause the thumbnail of the previous deleted item to go to the new one. This can be an annoyance. The second is that if you log into another account, every channel that had been used at one point whill have a message notification. The notifs will not go away unless you do it manual (going to each) or to close the app and then open it a second time. :/",4
com.discord,Gabriel Turingan,"I edited this review, so far the only problem I have is the way Discord cannot let me send a video because the file is over 8mb. The size of the video is 7.04 mb and still, even if I compress the video, Discord keeps saying it's over 8mb. If this is a bug. Please fix it. I cannot enjoy and share videos with my friends. Thank you devs",2
com.discord,M B,"This new update is unacceptable. Things that were fine previously, like the way messages load up (which is now incredibly choppy) have been made worse. Some image previews also appear to be very small within channels for no particular reason, whereas others seem to be normal size. The only good thing to come from this update is the improved message searching feature. Everything else should be reverted.",2
com.discord,Tabassum K,"The app was great before this month's update. Now it crashes often, gifs don't work, slow in response, overall there's lots of difference in it's working.

Please repair the flaws soon, so that the app is perfect again.",3

com.discord,yuvraj1801,"This new ui is seriously garbage, The font looks okay I guess.

I also keep having this problem where if I'm looking in one channel and if I switch to another channel, the contents of the pervious channel would show instead, the only way I could find to fix it was to restart the app which is super annoying.

com.discord,BunnyPop2036,So I don't have anything against the way it looks. It's more like when I try to do permission for my server or another people's servers that I work on. It won't show all the bots. And only maybe 2 to 3 of them. They show up all around the server but not in permissions. Please fix this.,2

com.discord,Shaun Collier,"Please undo the latest update. You have made so many awful subtle changes that it's really disconcerting to use. Tapping back needs to be done more than once in order for the app to recognise you've actually gone back, and it's sluggish and slow to respond, like you've built loads of unnecessary routines behind the scenes. This is a terrible update - if you don't have a QA team hire one, and if you do, please fire them and start again.",1

My issue is that discord markets itself as being the ""solution"" to the messy hellscape of messengers (Skype, insta, messenger, snapchat, etc. etc.). But at the end of the day discord is just another app I have to have to keep up with the people I know who use it. I long for the day that we can standardize on an open protocol like XMPP or even IRC, but it will never come.",3

com.discord,Matyas Halir,"Great concept. Last update broke the execution style though. Been using the app for a long time, but the update is *bad*. GIF autoplay settings nowhere to be found (Important section), with an annoying tag on the pictures. Videos sometimes load just the audio (Multiple networks tested, consistent until reloading). Online status for 2 person chats is too small. Other than this, a great app for community communication, but I have to take away 2 stars for the cliff the UX has taken a dive off of.",3

I can no longer tap and hold a server to ""Mark As Read""; as someone who uses an external keyboard with Discord on tablet, I can no longer press enter to send a message for some reason; there's a strange grey bar at the bottom of my screen that does nothing; font size inexplicably unreadably small.

In addition, the removal of features from Nitro classic (and moving them to a higher tier) without any changes in its price is a little upsetting. Removing features rather than adding actually newly developed ones to the higher tiers of nitro doesn't seem like great business practice. 9/16: Recent updates are EVEN laggier.

Channels with a lot of subchannels often auto-scroll to the top of the channels. Subthreads with a lot of messages often fail to jump on the latest unread, instead somewhere random. Very impractical setting with jarring, discrepant font sizes (either too big or too small and weird zoom function. Seems like a greedy move to force nitro to me.",1

Everyone on mobile is having this issue so dont act like its the networks fault. What moron wouldn't try a different network? I'm guessing the morons who replied???",1
com.discord,Caol√°n Willett,"Since I've used Discord, it's only been a positive experience.

Highly reccomend.",5
com.discord,nanana,"I'm experiencing a bug where threads are unaccessible / gone missing even though I just made it a few hours ago. The app feels... blocky?? Mainly, the UI just feels laggy and appearance wise it's pretty bad; there's a space in between message lines, images and gifs aren't loading even though my connection is fine. I hope you bring back the old discord next update :( Other than minor bugs, the old version is perfect.",1
com.discord,Eon Slater,"I had no problem with this app until the new update. Overlay is bugged, the icons are just gone but I can still touch them, status is just missing, personal settings as well, like what happened???

Its very unprofessional, and just please, either revert back to the old version, or find a way to fix these issues.",1
com.discord,AN TI,"Since the last update discord has gone from working consistently, to consistently not working. It used to be a once-a-week (or less) issue that channels, messages or content would not load, now it is multiple times a day all day every day. Why downgrade the app on android just to make it have parity with ios? Nobody needed or wanted this",1

I'm beggining to think these pathetic updates was intended to make their app more modern. Why fix something that isn't broken, and why intentionally make you app slower? Fix you app discord it's slow.",1
com.discord,BreyIzLitt!,"the latest update just feels bad man. The UI is bad, the way you sent a message just sends instantly instead of having it a bit delayed is so stiff for me to look at, the app feels slower than usual, and my emotes just sometimes get out of bounds when I try to split screen. Granted its easier to create a server on mobile cause most features on PC isn't restricted to mobile now, but the new update just makes me not want to use this app at all. It's hard for me to adapt to these new changes...",1

Now it has annoying sound effects, the overly in calls don't work properly and there's a dumb black screen the appears now when you screenshare. The mute button/ other buttons also have a huge delay now too. It's basically like they took every bad thing from the PC version and now put on the phone and it is even worse than the PC version.

I use discord on a android and when I try to send someone photos it just keeps showing me the same ones when I scroll down into my camera roll and when I try to send photos they don't load and I have a really good internet and I tried restarting my phone and deleting the app and installing it multiple times.,5

Only complains I have are it's glitches, such as when I undeafen while watching a YouTube video, it puts my discord call on phone speaker instead of my headphones, which caused an embarrassing problem a couple minutes ago. Edit: Joining on a call, it unmuted me even though I've muted myself. It has happened almost every time and it's starting to piss me off. Sept 15, 22: Jfc, this app consumes so much battery.",4

Only upon after activating my Nitro was I made aware that I can't actually use any of the Nitro benefits since I purchased through Google Play.

Why accept Google Play payments?",1
com.discord,Diss3mbled,Absolutely fantastic service. I will give it 5 stars once they cut their ties with the communist party of China and also stop selling people's personal information.

com.discord,Brannan Bertram,"Discord is amazing and the older versions of the app are good aside from the bug that emotes of the same name don't send, but the latest update has ruined it. Videos often don't load or just show as black, it lags so bad and pauses between channel switching and it tells me I can't upload files because of the 100mb limit even when the files I am trying to send are all smaller than that by a lot. I really hope it gets fixed soon",1
com.discord,Toasty M,"The new update is the WORST! Like, it's one thing to have to get used to whatever the heck they changed with the fonts and the interface, but now replying to a message will take you to the bottom of the chat which is very annoying and uncomfortable ugh!! Also gifs keep glitching and turning all black now. Nice. Ugh! Scrolling through older messages now is a trash experience!",1
com.discord,Amy Stevely,"Is this what iOS users are putting up with? My god. Where did the favourite emotes go? Why can't I scroll infinitely from a search anymore? Why are all the fonts compressed? The app is just so difficult to look at now and all the features I once enjoyed are suddenly gone. While I'm in the app, messages from a different server will now appear with this annoying and distracting timer, and they take up so much of the screen now too. 2 stars because at least there are mobile spoilers now I guess",2
com.discord,AJ Grady,"Idk why you decided to ruin a good thing. But ever since this update, I can't even share links anymore the way I used to, just sharing with the discord option doesnt work, have to copy the link then paste it in or it doesnt show up.

It doesn't feel smooth to run anymore, the uploads/sharing of pictures feels clunky/glitchy to view now Hopefully something gets resolved in whoever comes up with these new changes.

It's filled with too many animations that make the performance unstable, every major feature you spend the majority of your time using now has a chance to refuse input, the app eats through battery like nothing else, it's blatantly broken embedding functionality.

com.discord,Gawain Cross,"Discord is great and I use it daily, but the fact I have to pay for basic services like animated emojis, to share emojis from channel to channel, or even sending simple files is ridiculous and has no real reason to be there other than to mimic microtransactions in video games.

com.discord,lilian edith,"the app itself is good, it's the main app I use to message some of my friends, and to admin a 30k+ member server! but I don't much like the new mobile update - the fonts seem squished and just out of place, the profiles are strange being different, visually it's wrong, if that makes sense? it's also caused a lot of visual glitches in some server I'm in, particularly with the channel names being cropped. overall I just prefer the old version",3
com.discord,KeeperofTwilight,There were issues with not sending multiple photos at once and it has been fixed with today's update. I'm not experiencing any other problems as of yet. Thank you discord team for working out the issues!,5

com.discord,peppa,"not friendly. I have been using Discord for almost two years now, and almost every server I join, there are pedophiles & other toxic people. I don't blame that on Discord itself though, it's mostly the moderation & staff that's at fault. But I've noticed that Discord is very unsafe, people can dox you within seconds, which goes to show that it's not safe at all. Not the best app, but not the worst app either.",2
com.discord,the guardian of the multiverse,"Alright, so, how many negative reviews do these idiots need to read before they realise that this update has ruined the mobile experience for many, how stubborn are they for not returning to how it used to be, the app freezes every 5 seconds, crashes, and constantly gets to the point where it asks me if i want to exit the app, and dont you dare reply to this telling me to try another network, or whatever, because these issues started when this update got installed on my phone, REVERT THE UPDATE!",1
com.discord,forest feirns,This app seems nice and all that but the thing is that I keep getting crash when I tried to open the gallery every time and I can't even move anything it keeps getting laggy.,3
com.discord,Shane,"Like others, this is just a thing about the update, but ever since the app updated itself without me doing anything, everything has been extremely laggy, typing is slow as a result of it, I'll be typing and be kicked off my keyboard for no reason and can't type for a while, on top of the fact the app not only crashes itself, but crashes my whole phone when I use it. Idk what changes causes this, but please do something about it - it works fine on other apps, and has only been a discord problem.",1
com.discord,HazelFox,Recent update made it to where I can't send more than one image at once regardless of size. It's starting to annoy me badly and I have no way of getting ahold of support to get this fixed...,3
com.discord,BehnamAK73,"The update just made the app more complex, the ui is unappealing, everything just takes more time to do, videos don't play normally anymore and if you change channels the video just keeps playing in the background, and everything is just so slow, the font is weird, the channel lists are squished and it's quite easy to missclick. Ruined.",2
com.discord,DERRELL WHITFIELD,This disappointed me a lot. I wish I never updated discord at this point. After updating this App. I had accidentally logged out. Then when I tried to log back in my Account suddenly got disabled. I was really Unhappy when I heard that. Could you pls fix the update,1
com.discord,Rimuru Tempest,"The app is great it's easy to understand and use. I've been using this app for more than 5 years, it runs fine and dandy but this new update just ruins everything. Firstly, the whole app is becoming more and more laggy everytime. And uploading files just intensifies it. Plus the odd layouts and the text fonts being janky and noticeably bigger. Thank you.",1

com.discord,too many anime characters,Would've gave 4-5 stars but I dislike the fact that because it's changed to the PC UI because I can't send :) since it'll just correct to üôÇ + bugs and glitches have been happening so I'd prefer an option if we could change it back to normal,3
com.discord,Nick Kelly,Discord is the best app for voice calling out there. I can always connect to my friends even if in out in the middle of nowhere. The mobile app is easy to use and looks great,5

com.discord,Aaron Smith,"Discord's awesome, and everybody knows it. My only issue with the app is I wish it just did a regular 'send you a code' two factor instead of the 'you have a pile of codes on the website' so if you're staring at your computer then you and only then do you have access to a two-factor if you get logged out for some reason",4
com.discord,Vinny Peppermint,Pretty good app occasionally bugs the hell out but usually when that happens it's more funny it doesn't actually hurt or mess me up Good app. I do kind of wish there was a brightness mode that was between light mode and dark mode,4
com.discord,Victor B√¢rlƒÉdeanu,"This new update is absolutely awful. The app is buggy as hell now. When I'm on phone it shows that I'm idle instead of online. The typing is laggy and choppy, the fonts and proportions between UI elements have changed for the worse, every time I open the app the chats history is empty and takes a few seconds to load when it used to be instantaneous before, and these are just a few thing. Why was this update necessary? It didn't add any improvements and only ruined the experience üòí",1
com.discord,Leaf,"since the latest updates the app has been very laggy, every time i close it for a few seconds and open it again the messages don't load, it reconnects me and sometimes even doesnt show my dm list. when sending pictures the bar shows up then the picture disappears altogether for like 10 seconds and sends very late. its really annoying and i hope it can be fixed soon",1
com.discord,Ty Robertson,"It is pure misery trying to login to Discord on a new device. Cyber security is a real thing... But you guys have, without question, the worst credentialing and sign-in verification process of any app I have ever used anywhere. It is a flagrant waste of time fussing with this.",1
com.discord,Vin Guy,"This new update is atrocious. Everything looks like it's been designed with the appearance of being slick and modern while ignoring usability. The app has you wait 2 seconds before showing the server you clicked, browsing channels is much harder to casually do because of their new tiny size, server emotes are now displayed in such a big space that it causes decision fatigue and harder navigation and so much more. I've installed an apk of the previous version and recommend everyone do the same.",1
com.discord,Vinny,"the app and the new font is a nightmare for anyone who has visual impairments or dyslexia, no idea who went through with this im pausing the update to this app until you give us the choice of custom fonts or you revert it because me and so many others are struggling to read anything",1

com.discord,Wrenix,"Despite the updates it's still embarrassingly broken despite their promises that they're fixing the issues, the app is so broken right now that power point presentation seems more like a viable option then this platform since I'm crashing 4 to 6 times a day where as before I bearly crashed once. Until they get their platform in working order again I'd recommend avoiding this social media, those who already use it I'd say don't pay them another penny towards nitro since it's clear they don't care",1

I'm BEGGING you to remove this update and go back to the previous version. The smoothness and ease of use is all gone now. It's jagged, clunky, laggy, and an overall horrendous experience. How did you manage to make the app WORSE with this update? I'd give zero stars if I could.",1

I have been obstructed in using this simple app, by the app itself, and thus I throw in my towel. I wont be using the app, nor shall I log in until this issue has been fixed - so far this issue is YEARS old, as one quick google search will tell you. At a certain point you have to ask ""is it worth it?"", And no, discord is NOT worth the complications, when there are similar apps without this issue.",1
com.discord,Viorell,Discord was great but now it has alot of bugs and glitches like my sending button now just a blue circle the sending pics & vid now just grey circle still can use it but very bothering also alot of things become just flat without no images please fix this and also i can't send files even when my connection was so fine,2
com.discord,Tyrannosaurus Gaming,"Your ""improvements"" in today's update were garbage. Im seriously considering Uninstalling just because of how horrible it looks. Anyone who hasn't updated yet, DO NOT update. The whole app is harder to use, its slower, the font looks like an absolute nightmare. The new system for choosing images to send is just a huge inconvenience. The other one was perfect. Why change? Come on discord. Why try and ""fix"" what wasn't broken.",1
com.discord,Wizered 99 (Wizered99),So many bugs in the new update. Can't even retain video cam when you switch apps. Such a basic feature completely lost from before the update. Cannot recommend anymore.,1
com.discord,FIRE STAR,"I love discord however I'm only giving 2 stars because of a recent update everything is now a hot buggy mess. The UI doesn't work properly, bringing up the message options or a users profile most of the time it only displays HALF of the UI and there is just a massive Gap where it is supposed to cover, this results in an awkward scrolling which often leads to me closing it by accident. Videos do not work properly anymore as they often just stay black with only audio. Please revert it!",2

Message text and server chat lists are all bunched up into walls of text which makes them really difficult to read. The app is buggy and will sometimes spam me with ~5-10 notifications from random servers in a 20 second period. I can't watch embedded videos anymore as they're just black screens with audio. Please change it back to how it was, this was honestly a terrible update and has improved nothing.",1
com.discord,DragonGirl 9999,"I loved this app. It was great for school and gaming, or just group chats with friends.

com.discord,PR.PARADOX,"The app itself is very cool and the things that i am gonna talk about are need but definitely a want so, please add more roles option, calendering, announcement system, media channel type, self assignable roles, subscription, etc if it will not inplemented then i think i will move to guilded the only thing i dislike about guilded is that it is less active and superlaggy but if discord also sopport that feature it will be most useful chatting platform so please implement these features thanks",5
com.discord,Alari,"It also sometimes shows messages sent from me as messages sent from someone else. Or it won't show some messages at all, but this isn't due to my Internet being bad. Even if it's good it happens. Also why can't I look anymore from what server the emote is before sendig?",2
com.discord,Azazel,"Since the update it's made it impossible to update roles on my server, everytime I try to it crashes, over and over and over again, but only with roles so far, it's frustrating.",2
com.discord,Mike Nay,"Update: Even with near daily supposed updates, the new version still SUCKS. Literally the worst app, canceling Nitro until they actually fix this garbage. The new android update is atrocious. Nothing works, it's laggy to the point it is unusable. Just a complete garbage fire. I've never in my life seen an app ""update"" completely ruin an app so badly.",1
com.discord,A Human,"Discord is a very nice socializing app. But I have one problem, When logging in to my account, It asks me to verify. But when I click on the phone option, it will automatically close when I wasn't finished typing in my information. The same thing happens with the email option. I hope you can fix this problem.",4

com.discord,Rhett Gross,"The voice chat option can be a bit garbled at times, but the app is perfect for on line gaming interaction. I have joined so many group channels and made friends in ways you just can't by a normal game chat.",5
com.discord,inperfect Cell,I feel this needs to be said. But the new update has made discord worse on every level. The font size and style has changed which can anger some people.The app no constantly lags in places and chats where it never did before. For example when i go into any general or voice chat it lags so bad that my phone freezes up. Another negative is the image system before you could browse all photos and videos within the app but now you can only look at recent stuff. Which makes it way less convenient.,3
com.discord,ÊÅã‰∫∫„Éó„É™„É≥,"Well the new update got rid of the issue but for some reason the newest update decided to bring back the ""Tap for more images"". To say the least that feature is more useful on IOS and not mobile as it will cause android phones to crash",2
com.discord,Tat Alin,"the setting which enables reduced motion fixed most of my lag, but it still takes way longer than usual to reply to a message or edit one. Why was this update neccessary? It genuinely adds nothing other than fancy movement for ui on the screen which can't be completely disabled along with useless changes to fonts and text size. edit: and now half the videos i play will literally not load, and instead show a black box with the audio.",1
com.discord,August Angell,"Overall, it's fine. The reason I'm writing this is because with a new update, people who use the bot PluralKit can not use emojis from servers who don't have the bot. Discord has said they will not be fixing this issue. There is no reason to keep the systems of discord from using all their emojis. It shouldn't be the users responsibility to download the bot. I personally think this is ablist and should be fixed.",2

com.discord,Marin,"This new update is unusable. I was using an older version of the app for a little while, until they decided to shut down all the old clients.

com.discord,N Dragneel,"Man after the update on android, its nothing but just trash, like there's nothing good about it.

Create inconvenience for the users?",1
com.discord,TheFieryFennec,"Once again, the app is laggy, I can see buttons thankfully, however typing has become laggy and will freeze for no reason only to type the same word twice or 3 times. Not only that but just checking notifications is laggy too. Please fix this issue",3

com.discord,Joyous,"Discord is pretty much ad free except for when they advertise their nitro service. The nitro is worth getting, but only if you use discord a lot and have the money to spare. I overall feel very satisfied with the app and the service. Stay safe using it, though, as with all social media and messaging services, toxic people might be present. If you're in a bad situation, remember you can just leave. If you're in a bad relationship, you can break up. It's all good. Take care.",5

com.discord,Sondy ‚ÄúRocket Jaguar‚Äù Leison,"I've been using this app since a few months after it went public and it has been an increasingly positive experience.

com.discord,Poppy Whittington,"App works good. Very similar functionality to the desktop version, which ensures you don't have to bounce between platforms. Sometimes I have connection issues, but that's my dog ISPs fault, not Discords",5
com.discord,Jo,"I'm on the latest version, it still doesn't hide the channels list by default in landscape mode when portrait mode does and it's causing issues with the placement of the chat squishing it to the right, New Thread button, pictures and emotes get cut off from view on the right too. The app lags, the ""new unreads"" popup forces open/close the keyboard, gifs error, previewing an image no longer shows all the image and sending multiple images sets off the 100mb limit even if their size is way less.",1
com.discord,Snowy Glaceon,I have a new number and the verification works now! But the new update has made everything very choppy and often I have to exit out of the app just to set the rearranged roles. It's really frustrating.,3
com.discord,Amelia Whitlock,"New update SUCKS it's super laggy and no videos will load, it's just a black screen whenever you try to play one. The automatic emojis are also very annoying, the notifications that pop up on the top of your screen are also bad because even if I turn them off, it still comes up and I dislike how boxy everything is now, discord didn't need an update it was great the way it was, not an update, that's a downgrade.",2

It's truly the everything burrito of message apps.",5
com.discord,Sorah G,The UI is completely broken since the last update. I was unable to use my Bluetooth earbuds until I reinstalled the app. But now I can't even post gifs or emotes since the UI is broken and off screen.

I'm sorry but I thought the beta was for the purpose of testing these updates yet why is it that it's worse than it's previous version every single time? My discord was crystal smooth and now it's having issues and lagging trying to just type, let alone send messages. All my favourite emotes are gone and the UI looks worse than before.

com.discord,Eric Krugman,"Discord user shy of 7 years. Nitro for 4 years. This is the last year I will be subscribed for nitro. In the last 3 months, discord has shown disregard for the users with the obscene handling of the ""new"" android experience, and continues to foster disruptive bugs that never get fixed. It is clear they are focused on growth rather than quality. The devaluing of the lesser nitro tier (presumably to promote the expensive tier) removed any hope I had left for discord as a ""good"" company.",2
com.discord,Brian Ream,Latest update has killed it. Images no longer display right. Clicking a channel loads the wrong channel. Messages just go wherever they want to. You guys ruined this. What an absolute shame.,1
com.discord,Aphios Ey,I love how easy it is to use and to talk to friends. I will still forever have problems with the voice chat no matter what device I use. I suggest adding directions for things. Sometimes it's overwhelming,4
com.discord,Rocket_League Road_to_SSL,It's the best app for calls I love the fact that you can go live in a call and there is actually 1 thing missing the app would be much better if the emojis were just normal instead of weirdly drawn I hope this will change the emojis if the emojis weren't weirdly drawn then I would give it a 5,4

Iam a regular in a server that has unlocked upto 100MB in uploads, but still, The video uploads from mobile cant be played directly in discord, while the same video would play directly within the dicord chat if I upload from a PC. I have tried this from multiple mobile and PC devices using multiple internet connections and the problem persists. Please provide a fix for this. Thank you",4
com.discord,Magdalena Dhima,"I don't do reviews but the latest updates are ruining my experience. Still discord has trouble connecting, media becomes black and need to be refreshed and there are many many more bugs. Sometimes reactions don't show, my images don't show when I send them and messages don't show. Furthermore, still when I open the app, it tells me to report my friend for spam before it loads his messages. What is happening????? My friend too is experiencing bugs",1
com.discord,Soury Salt,"The new update made the app a bit laggy and hard to use. It cannot even play Gifs properly without it lagging out. And no it's not the internet i checked, and its not my storage either as i have many storage left. To specify I am using a samsung tablet",3
com.discord,Evie Hamilton,When my old friend first asked me to install discord to talk to them I thought it sounded concerning (discord almost sounds menacing) but this application is an amazing way for people to communicate. They also let people have a go and develop their own applications and bots which is something I'm sure will help improve the digital literacy of future IT billionaires,5
com.discord,Gabriel Garcia,"Best social app out there. Skype is trash. Team speak is even worse. There isn't anything better on the market to text, voice call, screenshare, and more with people on PC. Not only 1 on 1 or in small groups but up to thousands of people. It does it all. No this isn't a bot or paid review. My discord is Gabe#2899 Also just had to add one more thing, there are no ads in this app which isn't the norm anymore. Weird how you can't get a good free app these days without it full of Ads (Instagram)",5
com.discord,Jackson Lee,I enjoy discord a lot but the new layouts they keep putting out suck. I'm going to stop using it until it gets changed so I can actually use the mute button easier or if they put an option to revert the layout for mobile. Not easy to use while in voice chat.,2
com.discord,Lauren Laceration,"Used to work just fine until they did the recent big update. Now it runs like molasses where it used to be smooth as butter, shows text through spoiler tags without clicking them, prompts you to create a new channel when you click on any, moves you to the base channel of threads wherever you try and navigate to, overheats your device and generally doesn't work how it should. I'm told it's because they couldn't be bothered maintaining the android version so now we have the apple one but worse.",1

Then install it now.,5
com.discord,John hankin,"This update sucks, hard. In an attempt to update the UI to something that looks abhorrently worse to the original, everything else seems to have broken.

The app used to be absolutely amazing and great, but with the new update, the Emotes don't correlate with the correct Servers/categories in the Emotes tab, the buttons, Channels, and everything is absolutely tiny and hard to read, the App's performance has absolutely gone to nothing, as it's constantly lagging/buffering. Just revert the update to the previous version, as the new one just broke it and made it awful.",1
com.discord,Jack Turner,Installed this app because xbox game pass perks had an offer of 3 months free nitro. Signed up for an account but the nitro can't be activated. Emailed support and they said it's because my account is ineligible. Not sure why it's ineligible because I'm confident it meets the criteria of the promotion. But alas is wasn't meant to be.,1

com.discord,HemlockNight (HemlockNight),"The new UI update is absolutely horrible, almost unusable. I use my phone largely in landscape and now it's impossible to even see what I'm typing with how bloated the UI elements are. Images don't display well anymore, becoming tiny and blurry or cropped. Parts of the UI take up more space than tbey did before. Many bad decisions like that, please just revert that terrible update.",1

com.discord,Ryan Hershey,"I was having a great deal of fun in this app, it used to be 5 stars for me, but my account got wrongly disabled by discord for something that I didn't do. Discord still has not re-enabled my account after I sent a complaint in explaining that whatever I did wrong, I didn't know that what I was doing was wrong. (Still a little mad about the account thing, but I got it back and and everything's been as normal! Discord is now my favorite way to communicate with my friends online again!)",4
com.discord,nobody to you,"Tbh I use discord for literally all of my messaging, creating servers for friends is ridiculously convenient, and being able to manage everything means that you can still have a civil discussion in one chat while ""those friends"" post all the explicit material they want in another chat without being incredibly obnoxious. I'm sure we all know that one guy.",5
com.discord,Hyena,"Pretty mid. I'm sure there have been improvements to the dev pipeline, but it's made for a worse app since Android is essentially just getting the tablescraps from other builds (iOS). It might be worth going back to separate builds.",3
com.discord,Szonja,"The update is terrible and the new UI is taking up a lot of space. Searching messages in PM is difficult and have to reload tons of messages, I can choose from the latest ~20 photos to send, if I want to send an older one I have to open my gallery. It's extremely laggy and I wish I could just keep the old version before the update.",1

com.discord,Argo Ashton,"Used this app for years without issue, but now they've switched to a the stock standard ios reactNative which is full of bloatware and in my option, uglier. I'm not having any serious bugs but graphics now glitch whenever moving (ie opening a messages setting/reacts) and not to mention each transition takes what feels like a second longer. It's a little thing but it distracts me everytime I try to do something and ultimately ruins the user experience for me.",1

com.discord,Kim Kelly,I joined a patreon community so I could connect to the discord and the chats and channels never showed up. I emailed support several times and they could never solve the issue. I got tired of bugging the moderator so much to try and get it fixed and eventually had to leave the patreon. Even the servers I did join were either dead or had so many members and channels that im not sure how anyone could connect on this app. You cant even search in the app for servers to join. -Android user,1
com.discord,Philipp Yeo,"Discord on Android feels like an after thought. Most times notifications appear so delayed it's actually sad.

Very practical, Discord.",1

I can't think of a single thing that I'm missing in this app. And it's rare that I'll choose an app on my phone over my computer if they're both in the same room. But this one I don't feel like have to go to my computer to do anything.,5
com.discord,Jordan Hough,"I updated my Discord today on my chromebook and whooo boy, it's basically unusable. I can't use the mouse to switch between servers and channels, I used to use shift+enter to go down a line, but now enter alone does that, so I have to manually click the send button.

com.discord,Dovafish,"App used to work absolutely perfectly on mobile, I practically lived off discord mobile during lockdown. Unfortunately the new update has made it practically unusable. closing the keyboard when you want to type things into search bars, the image select menu is laggy and can bug to take up the whole screen, it frequently crashes if you leave the image selector menu open, swap into other apps and back into discord, i frequently have to leave and rejoin calls also. Can we have the old version back.",1
com.discord,Noah Carswell,"Everything was working fine until this ""major update"" happened to the Android app. Now not only does my microphone go super quiet whenever anything is done about a screenshare, but my DMs seem to never load properly.

Are they not using android phones?",5

com.discord,Maja S√∏rensen,"Wow the latest update really sucks. It's much less smooth, layout is uglier, I cannot select images to send directly in the app, settings get reset and some of them disappeared (such as no emojis in the text editor and no push notifications). It lags more and when I open the app it takes longer to load, And opens at a server rather than my DM page. The way you tap and hold to bring up the menu to reply or react to messages is also way worse now. Awful even. Please go back :(",1
com.discord,Architect Shinamore,"Can't give this one a 5 star because every update seems to be better than the last, Work, School, Social, Personal, Professional. This makes stack look like a child's app. My one issue is it's complexity but that's what makes it beautiful",4

com.discord,Karthor Demitri,"Discord is ordinarily a wonderful experience on the normal & admin side. This recent update has literally thrown a spanner into what once was a solid system. Trying to do almost anything on an android system is now an absolute chore, deleting a comment deletes one prior to it, editing one duplicates & posts it, everything is trying to connect so viewing normally is also now a longer process and it is just overall buggy and unpolished now. Otherwise it is still a pleasant experience off android.",2

It just keeps crashing and being slow. It also only shows content from only one channel in every channel I click.",3

The icons are now ridiculously small even though the toolbar has so much wasted space, the group title seems smaller than people's names below, and there's still an obnoxious gift nitro button on the screen 24/7 that literally nobody asked for.

My tablet device updated to the latest version this week, and with the update the application lost support for both a physical keyboard and split screen use, as going split screen now just chops off the entire chat area.

Please revert to the previous build for Android until this latest version is 100% identical in user experience, features etc to the prior android experience.",1
com.discord,The sleepy trans King,I really like Discord. The only thing I hate about it is the fact we always have to put our password in when we wanna change our usernames. Like I forgot my password and now I can't change my username. It won't let me reset my password anymore and it's just so annoying. It didn't have the reset password and it's so frustrating how I used to be there and I can't change it anymore. It had my passwords saved then after a update it didn't saved. I had them saved because I know I wouldn't remember it,3

Server channels also look bad when listed. I have more problems but running out of space.",1

Update: downgraded it further to 1 star. Too much bugs.",1
com.discord,Alpha,I really dislike the new update. Androids normally don't have display screens as big as a PC so the new UI gets frustrating because of the small size of basically everything now! The notification settings get reset every time I close the app. Also I really don't see the point in getting to see channels while texting like even when u accidentally touch the side u r shifted to another channel. This UI is just really unpleasant for me.,1

It keeps having weird bugs where it doesn't update what content to show and i have to force close it. It crashes when i try to do something more than just writing. It's sluggish. I don't care honestly that you want to have a single technology. Tech decisions should not impact users negatively.,1

The app now switched to React Native, nothing wrong with it, but there's a number of critical bugs that make the app completely unuseable as a messaging application.

One little misclick can cause you to lose an important dm from someone, and the dm requests don't even ping you, meaning if I don't check my dm list I won't even know that I have any dm requests pending. Either remove or fix this,tq.",2
com.discord,Î¶¨ÎßàÎ¶¨,"This app is great for communication and all but i would just like to state my reason here for rating it 2-stars. After discord latest upd, i saw lots of changes. Firstly, whenever i chat with someone, my keyboard keeps appearing although i'm not trying to type a message. Second, when i check my profile, the profile banner is always loading. I like the discord before this update way more. Also probably because i'm way more used to the version before this one. The UI changes were unexpected.",2
com.discord,Whale,A few months back they introduced a UI update that made this app freeze every few minutes for several seconds. Excruciatingly painful. It's still like that.,2
com.discord,zaigovroom,I keep crashing when i play a video and there's so many bugs i really liked the other version now it's just ruined. So many bugs and glitches please fix it. And the app is SOOOO SLOW,2
com.discord,Aklesh Shetty,"What the hell is wrong with current update! Its just working on its own, like, am tapping one thing and it issues another command!

I've downloaded authy and Google authenticator and none of them work. Please give me a solution to get my old account back. Also there's no settings option. Just email/ password, log in or sign up and the auth/backup page.",3
com.discord,Death,I liked the former Gallery view of the Discord app since I can just scroll down indefinitely and find it easily. Using the files or the gallery app is really annoying not to mention disorienting when you're used to the former picture view of the app when you want to send pictures.- Some of the features seems... unnecessary. I might change the review once the update just makes the gallery view of the Discord app go back again.,3
com.discord,jb tenaja,Too many issues. The automated instruction is not relevant to the issue. Supports are unavailable. All in all bad experience. I strongly recommend other apps similar to this.,1

com.discord,syed emran hussain,Okay so at the start when I first downloaded this app I could actually do things unlike now. Since I have a chromebook lenovo (I had a normal lenovo before) when I try and go in different servers its just wont work..

com.discord,Sincara,"Discord is always my go to, but man the new mobile app update made discord quite bad in design. Design I can get used to it, but AFTER EVERY FRIGGIN MESSAGE SENT; whole thing/my typin lags.

Please do something about this since its impossible for me to use phone app and for now can only turn to pc one- qwq",1
com.discord,Brandon M,"Latest update absolutely horrible! Interface is very confusing & buggy, no longer user friendly at all... Oh and STOP telling people to check their wifi or internet or android phone update....look at ALL recent feedback from users stating this latest update took everything that was essentially perfect and made it very agitating to use. PLZ ROLL BACK THE LATEST UPDATE! if it was not broke...DON'T fix it...(Update) 10/9 they only auto reply, see their reply claiming wifi issues.",1
com.discord,Jason McGehee,"I would give this zero stars if I could, monkeys on typewriters could code better. Almost like 4 years and across 3 different devices you guys still haven't managed to find a way to fix the absolute disgusting way discord just continually eats up more and more bandwidth when it's not connected to a call or even open, to the point my phone thinks my ISP isnt sending me service until I completely force stop and clear all data from discord, what a joke",1

com.discord,Rose Rosas,New update makes the app slow. The slightest movement closes the video player but the audio still plays in the background with no way of turning it off.

com.discord,Christopher Pederson,Awful. Literally how did you guys ruin this app. The UI was JUST fine beforehand. Why did you guys try and fix something that wasn't broken? I wish I could rollback. Multiple images don't send. They just get queued forever. The app looks clunky too. There was NOTHING wrong before.,1

com.discord,Ilija Kojic,"I've been using it for a longer time and it's a great app, but I've been having this issue since recently, basically when I set up a custom status and put it on ""don't clear"" it keeps setting it to ""clear tomorrow"" every time I save my settings, and it only happens on the mobile app, and also moving servers and groups, when you hold on them and move them, it usually just opens the options that are available, like ""open"", ""notification settings"", etc. instead if actually moving it.",4
com.discord,Frothy lmao,"the new update just lags my phone even more than before. using split screens make text size smaller than the preferred size in options, scrolling down is needed when making drafted long texts, and the send button is so close to the emoji icon and pops out the emoji slots instead of sending the message quickly, the style of sending messages just pop out like the normal pc discord, and i'm not very used to it yet. glitching just happens randomly at times. it's gotten a little bad.",3
com.discord,anthony hewitt,"I absolutely love discord but lately I've had a big issue with voice chats, and don't say it's my Internet because its perfectly fine, I always got strong connections, but everytime I'm in voice chat, It automatically disconnects me and adds me back into vc and it happens every 5 to 10 mins please fix",3
com.discord,Tanvi Shah,This new update is so horrible. The UI hurts my eyes the font scaling is horribly off extremely laggy and nothing is functioning as it should be. Please revert the update to what it used to be or at least let users use the older versions.,1
com.discord,Mr. Nexxext,"this update keeps getting worst, now some of my buttons/icons are missing from the bar below and the search bar, and some servers are missing their channel's names and server icons. i noticed sum of my friends got the same problem but some of them face different problems",1
com.discord,George M,Terrible update. The other reviews explain well. They haven't rolled out any fixes yet. It's been nearly 2 weeks. My app has got even worse as now the icons for buttons don't even show. Imagine if someone new downloads the app. They won't know which button is which if they can't see the icons. The app keeps getting worse. Just revert back to the old app. That would make me happy. Such an unnecessary update,1
com.discord,Giygas,"I don't like the new update. It screwed over my font size and when I change it back to what I am used to, a lot of channel names just turn to '...' Alongside single-coloured banners refusing to load, an overall more janky feel to the app (such as animations like deleting messages not playing) and more inconvenient buttons (copy ID under developer mode is slower now) and fatter buttons when embedding channels, Some things are just never meant to be changed, this is one of those.",3
com.discord,Mike,"This app is incredible. Easy to use, completely free but you can upgrade for unique features, and to support the developers of coarse. It's worth it to me because the app is so nice I gladly get Nitro for a few bucks a month.",5
com.discord,Owen Jones,"I did have a lovely comment previously, however discords been weird recently on my Android tab. by that I mean it's been playing through both my wired headset and out loud.

com.discord,Filip Babiƒá,"The latest update which pushes for tons of new features is mostly good, but it also introduces a lot of bugs and issues. I very much preferred the native look and feel for Discord, whereas this (I believe) cross-platform variant is just horrible and runs slow, janky and doesn't feel anywhere near as polished as before.",1
com.discord,Darky Doom,"Best interactive platform to be on for written, vocal, video chats and sharing lives, images, videos.

com.discord,Seth Domings,New update ruined uploading videos. When you upload a video it compresses it and makes the sound of the video very loud static. It only happens if you upload on the mobile app.,1
com.discord,Henobwene,"The recent update has been really sluggish to post many messages, or when many gifs are posted at once, my Xperia G3221 cannot really handle it which can really delay my inputs, on top of it not syncing properly when I turn on STAMINA Mode, which is supposed to make copy and pasting links anf stuff to discord instantaneous. Not sure if this was intentional to prevent spamming or anything, but more optimization is needed for me so that I could at least check out the new stuff.",3
com.discord,Havoxious,"Loved this app, used it a ton for work and friends, gaming, etc. New update looks like they attempted to port the iOS version over to Android and failed miserably. Images will merge with random gif or images from OTHER servers, clicking on one thing will redirect you to something else entirely, and a billion other ugly issues. I really hope they fix this fast.",1
com.discord,Conor MacHugh,"OnePlus 7 Pro T. Ever since the most recent update a lot of features are either janky or just flat out broken: The search for channel when sharing an image is flat out broken and causes the app to crash every time. Recent channels only shows 10 channels now The calibration of the UI seems to be off. Not sure how but loads of times now I've seemed to ""misclick"" on channels which tries to take me to create a new channel. Scrolling text seems to disappear after writing a long form message",1

com.discord,Josh Marxen,"Such a versatile app, so much personalization available to users, robust role and permission management, a vibrant plugin / bot ecosystem, built-in voice / video / streaming, and finally CHAT THREADS, all of which are currently free.

com.discord,Rinkaku,"I have been using this app a lot to chat with online friends, and find work as a video game composer. Not very fond of the changes in the new update, as it seems poorly optimized : my main complaint overall is that writing text messages feels very laggy.

Waiting eagerly for a newer update that will fix that.",3

There are so many issues with this update that I don't have a large enough letter count to even scratch the surface. I am replacing discord with telegram. Also, for those of you wondering why it was updated in the first place, here you go. Discord for iOS and android used to run on different programs. This update is a merge of the iOS system with android - it is for the comfort of the developers, not their users.",1

com.discord,Katarzyna Ony≈õk√≥w,"I loved discord, but it's getting very annoying... I can't go voice with my buds after the update, discord don't want to work with Bluetooth... I'm very disappointed and angry. In few past weeks it's still decreasing and I started to slowly disrespect the app, despite the fact that I have important servers there.",2
com.discord,Zach Owings,"Good platform, minimal ads, good way to keep in touch with friends. Would be nice to have multiple accounts though, just to keep my furry account away from my non-furry friends. Have had some rare trouble connecting in chats or having some voice pixelation. I'd say 4.5/5 if I could.",5
com.discord,RaythalosM,"The recent update made discord worse in every way. Gifs layer onto each other, emojis don't preview in the textbox anymore, performance tanked, and scrolling sometimes get stuck (you'd swipe down and then it moves up and then down as you release your finger) It's not unusable. But it's disappointing that they're pushing an iOS version onto the android one that caused all of these issues.",1

com.discord,CJX_Gaming,Love the app. Great for chatting with friends. Updated UI still needs updates. The only that bothers me is the discord file size without nitro is very annoying and it should be set to an average file size.,4
com.discord,Drona,"Whenever I try to login the app says ""New login location detected please check your email"" I never received anything from you guys and I'm not able to use discord at all. Hope this issue get's fixed soon. (Edit - It's Finally Fixed)",4

com.discord,Tamara Perryman,"Hey discord, a tip, people don't like it when they're in a voice call and you tell them their friend muted, but their friends screen shows as not muted, so they end up both thinking they're being ignored, only to see that no, discord is just an a$$. I just lost most of my hangout time with my friend on my day off to thinking I was being ignored, and then thinking I was mad, so thanks for that",1
com.discord,NoName_GC,"My experience so far is great, I met great people and a the communities I have been in was alright.

I did have my not so great experiences but the great ones overpowered them, good job Discord Team! - Q",4
com.discord,kami xo,"Honestly would've been a 5 prior to the update. Emojis have all been un-favourited although it's mostly just annoying. However, the app has become not only much slower but also downright unusable at times. Channels refuse to load, everything is clunky plus the video player is horrendous. Not to the mention the updated text interface. Agh my eyes hurt. Please do something and I'll happily give that 5 star review. Thank you!",1
com.discord,Yami,"After i try to reinstall the app, i can't download images anymore, keep saying ""please check your Internet connection and your photos app privacy settings"" i already give the app permission, my WiFi connection is smooth, why does it keep showing the same thing, can't download any photos, discord please fix it or show me how to fix the app please",3

Horrible and makes me contemplate moving my 110+ member gaming community to LINE. Put it back.",1
com.discord,tee_grandpa,"Discord is a really good app, unlike any social media I use but the new update is lacking. Instead of making the app better it just made it worse, constant lagging and the videos are unplayable, the video audios cross each other and it also continues playing after closing the app. The new design is fine even though there was nothing wrong with the previous one. Please just fix the lag and the video",2
com.discord,SY P,"overall good, but i dont like how the app does not resize in split screen. Also the sound gets messed up in call when using bluetooth headphones",3
com.discord,Devin Wible,Editing my review because they hit the killswitch on old versions to force people to update. It's still atrocious. Still worse than the old Android app. Why are you porting ios to Android? It looks and feels awful. Legitimatly migraine inducing animations. Unresponsive. Slow. Less features than the previous versions.,1
com.discord,John Doe,"Discord has been great up until the latest update, now it's just unusable on my android tablet. It keeps freezing and crashing all my apps. I've tried the suggestions of rebooting my tablet and clearing the cache etc, but nothing works. I'm glad this has happened now and not when I had nitro. I will be looking for an alternative.",1
com.discord,Postman4685,"I've been using discord since 2020 and normally I'd rate it 4 stars. Its a good app or rather it was a good app until the new update; the font size when typing is way to big, it's unbearably laggy, and the new font is so bad compared to the old one. Please just listen to these reviews thats all I ask for.",1
com.discord,Mimi Mimi,"I love this app, but the newest update is so uncomfortable. Everything has a different font size, and none of them is pleasent to look at. The menu looks much worse than before, the emojis are too big for my taste and i generally dont understand why you'd change the interaface when it was perfectly fine before. I hate it, and i know im not the only one... Besides from that, its a great communication app, i like the way the servers work, with many channels that are personalised:)",4
com.discord,Maayan Alon,"You somehow managed to drag the app to the deepest level you could, what the heck did you try to bring in the last update? WHY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WE CANT VIEW IMAGES PROPERLY??? That stupid swipe up/down to dismiss an image feature is so poorly made that if an innocence user wants to view the sides of the image while zoomed they have to use both fingers as if they are trying to zoom it but actually just moving it to the side. THIS IS ONLY 1 OF MANY new very inconvenient issues from this update",1
com.discord,Kat,I like the new update there's just a problem for android it's hard to explain where if the channel has font the text will go higher then I can read so you can only read the bottom of the text Edit 2 to 5 thank you for actually listening to what people have to say and not ignore us,5
com.discord,Kirsika-Marian Bazilenko,"It's my most used app but the last update is HORRIBLE. It's chunky, takes time to load chats and open servers, non functional as it doesn't allow turning up or lowering people's volumes is voice calls. Keeps loading for 30mins or so once a day at least. Visually looks terrible, text is harder to read, it's more annoying to write. HATE the notification thing that was added and you put mentiones into the same place as other notifications and so much more. This is the worst update so far reverse it",1
com.discord,Jason May,"Frustrating, Sometimes I get so many notifications that I'm annoyed then I'll go weeks with none and everyone has been using every method to warn me of my castle being attacked, only to receive it...... on back reading days later.

I love this app for what the capability, but, I recently had a friend who was banned, and we discussed, maybe they should make it where you are able to see the full reason,like if you wer banned due to someone saying your age maybe, have the ability to explain or refine from it, and have the permissikn to have the account back if its a age thing, like one year off.",4

I have to kill discord and reopen it and then retype the whole thing again. GIFS and photos sometimes render in weird resolutions, the list is too long to go on.",1
com.discord,Jonathan Blackwood,"I recently updated which included subtle UI changes but no new features or anything much really. Because I have an old phone i always have to move apps to my sd card but the recent update doesn't allow that anymore, and 70Mb of free space in total on my phone just isn't worth it.

com.discord,Morgan Kempton,This is the only app I ever use to talk to my friends. I love their voice call features amd adore all the emotes I have on here. Mobile doesn't feel quite as smooth as pc but it's more meant for pc anyways so no points off to them. Amazing app!,5

com.discord,"LUCAS, Jan Jenelle A.","This is the worst update they did. As a mobile user, I've so much struggle moving ONE single channel. These channels keep moving on its own and rearranging when I have a design layout for them is more annoying. Not to mention, you can't add emojis to the channels from your keyboard without having to copy and paste it, which is s hassle. Edit: Now I can't go back to Discord because I was ""spamming"" WHEN I WAS LITERALLY TALKING TO MY FRIENDS",1
com.discord,Kuro Avuli,"Up until recently it's been spectacular. Though lately, on mobile, when I send a message, I see the words get sent and received, but if I change my active app or close discord, then open, I notice my last message just vanishes. Furthermore when in a server with ppl talking, the smooth message scroll from ppl messaging is no longer smooth. Just instantly moves all the chat up, instead of a pleasant, easy to see / track slide",3
com.discord,Stephen Allen,"As social networks go, Discord is still one of the best. But it was better when all the notification settings were inside the app. Also I don't like that the in app notifications have reverted to an old UI.

com.discord,Ein_Seragaki,"I wish it was the old update because the voice overlay doesnt even work anymore, its pointless to have it on because it only shows your profile when talking and no one elses on the device. I also have to click a couple times to even mute myself or join vc and overall its laggy.",2
com.discord,Looth Ibrahim,There's still some issues such as Portrait videos being squished into wide screen when sharing. And an issue where while using voice overlay in a server vc if you go to a DM it dissapears till you go back to the server vc menu.,2

App is more laggy, images are poorly handled (cant zoom in via double tap, cant move the image with one finger), notifications are not working as well... I will be downgrading to the previous version and disabling auto-updates. Discord has not released a good ""new feature"" in years that would make me want to sacrifice UX in favor of getting said features quicker. Get better devs and use a proper language.",1

Its just a sensory overload. please at least add a switch in settings that will change it back to the orginal interface. it is also, very and i mean VERY laggy",1
com.discord,Cheetahmk2 Cheetahmk2,"Version 137.11 has introduces a number of tweaks to the UI, including how the left sidebar fills the screen, the size of the server and channel title text, and chat text itself; this was not in 126.21. I cannot find a method to revert these changes, and I am finding them significantly harder to work with. 1 star until resolved; companies need to stop making changes to UIs without asking - and warning - all users, and giving them an opt-out.

com.discord,Tttt Kkkk,"Update: the latest mobile client is also increasingly laggy. Good integration but no privacy or user control at all. Every once in a while, an update will just reset your settings and mess with the UI. Currently can't turn off animations, so everything shakes and bounces (and takes longer to use) even though Remove Animations is set in OS and Reduce Animation is set in app. Pretty mediocre experience in 2022.",2
com.discord,Thomas Schmidt,"Actually I am a big fan of this app and have a big community server myself. But since the last update, the app is almost unusable. It totally lags, you have to click 100 times on a button for it to react and basically makes you not want to use it anymore. I have the feeling they have moved away from a native app, to a bad ""frame"" embedding of a web version of discord. I can't explain this poor performance any other way. If they will return to the ""old"" App, I will definitely change my rating!",1
com.discord,Isabella Cristea,"I wholly regret updating to this newest UI. I thought that it would only come with normal bug fixes, as the previous UI was perfect as is; I had zero complaints with it, it was easily the best one it's had to date, and I've been using discord since 2016. But now? I am frustrated beyond belief whenever I try to do anything.

It has a good balance of everything, and I love the little notes from the developers when there's updates. The notes are down to earth, like you're just talking with your friend. They're talking as young adults would, but not in a cringy way, they can actually talk like human beings. I support and love this app.",5
com.discord,AH Shrayan,The old version was smoothly running on my pixel 3a. But after the new update it became so sluggish that using the app for more than few minutes became hard. After the horrible experience for a few days I thought uninstalling then again reinstalling will fix it a little. But after reinstalling it man I can't even log into my account.

com.discord,Xerkies,This app has been worse over time. When uploading a video. It auto compresses. There should be an option to disable it. I be sending vids under 100MB like 20MB and it still compresses it and worsen the quality. Will auto compressing be optional??,2

com.discord,Sunny,"I love this app but the new update horribly disappointed me. I don't know how to describe it properly nor how to word it in the best way, but it could've been better than expected. For example, when I send a message it just pops up in the chat instead of looking like it's sending properly, dunno if you understand me on this one but it really bugs me.

com.discord,Joe ‚Äú1st1todie‚Äù Slack,Great app. Great development. Billing is harsh not being able to pay your yearly resub to nitro and requesting a refund will get you locked outta your account for a few days but support will get you back in. The supoort is great. But overall decisions being made by hire ups is questionable. So manys games and services use discord integration to control account acess. If you are locked out of that account by discord do to billing issues then you just lost access to the game servers using discord,2

Also notification not appear in some phone its really annoying when you get Dm or mentioned by someone but you dont know it.... And smh now its has connection issue.. My internet was fine but discord keep connecting.. Pls fix these problem ASAP,1
com.discord,EliDoesStuff,Discord is spyware. There's no denying this. However this is the best app for chatting with friends and random people alike because everyone uses it. I haven't noticed many problems actually using the app either.,2

com.discord,Playtime,"One of the most used apps, by an absolutely massive landslide victory. However the latest update makes it completely unusable. I can see I'm far from the only one, since every single review is now 1/5 for this exact same reason. I'm lucky and was able to restore the old version by dropping out of the beta. When I finally receive the update in the live build it'll be permanently uninstalled. I hope the flood of negativity is enough to force a reversal on this. Cancelling nitro as well.",1
com.discord,Tim Keeling,"I was loving this app until this new version was released a few days ago. I appreciate you trying to refresh the layout but the app is now barely usable. Images won't load properly, gifs only randomly work & will also randomly resize. Sharing images direct to a thread leaves ghosting on the screen unless you changes threads. The app is super laggy & a battery drainer now. The post preview banner image takes up too much screen real estate & blocks menu + many more issues. PLEASE FIX OR ROLL BACK!",1
com.discord,Jack Burton,"Good app, used it for almost 3 years, helped me connect with my friends and family, however this new update sucks. Videos have no thumbnail on the image/video select screen, the new UI is terrible and just overall annoying to deal with. Like i said, this app has helped me reconnect and connect with people i dont see or talk to over like vacations or school and stuff but, the latest update is horrible",3
com.discord,Eric BigE (bdog52),Amazing app for voice chat that is amazingly simple to use. Often just opening it and clicking on the chat you want to hop into is enough setup to chat with people. Very user-friendly,5
com.discord,Steven,How about you try an update that removes your previous update and allows the app to work properly again. How can an established and recognized software company release something so broken? We really are screwed as a species. Update weeks later: it's still broken. I remember when discord used to play videos. I hope Elon buys discord next.,1
com.discord,incurae (cura),Fully broken as of this morning. Crashes every few minutes no matter what I do to troubleshoot. You would think they would just roll back to a previous version with these reports.,1

com.discord,Tracker,"Where is the ""uninstall update"" button? Major issue for me is that the textbox no longer scrolls when I'm typing, which completely screws trying to give detailed replies without multiple messages.

Please reverse these stupid changes and bring back the app we all loved for goo reason.",3
com.discord,Echoed Music (echo),The latest update has a neat design but it was executed horribly. The app runs worse then the old version now it is super slow and enjoys crashing my keyboard.

It's even more battery hungry than Genshin Impact itself, lags more than McDonald's wifi whenever anything happens, and overall has seen a performance drop.

com.discord,Omega Synth (Nich Productions),"After the latest Update, Discord stops responding every few seconds and takes forever to start responding again.

com.discord,Goose Boi78,"Overall for rn, i don't like the app. Just today it seems that I have to download this new update. I don't like the new format and how it now went to the IOS update.

com.discord,RedMonika,"I've never been compelled to write a bad review before. Till today. I have no idea what the whole point of this latest update was. If it was optimization, the app is even more of a messed up buggy mess, if it was to make it more mainstream friendly, did that really have to be done by removing some useful features like highlighting emojis when they're valid. Every day is potluck with what's gonna break and today's is the entire UI, can't see a single icon. A terrible direction to be going",1

com.discord,Shadic The Hedgehog,"The app was much much better without the update because it was faster,no crashing and no lag. But after the update it ruined it. Like for example: 1-If I send an attachment then it got sent, it'll keep resending over and over again everu time I am opening the app. 2-It's often saying that what I posted is explicit content tho it's not. 3-if I send like 3 pics together or something like that it'll crash constantly and I have to reinstall the app everytime that happens.",1

com.discord,RandomMemes,The UI and animation updates are clunky and juttery. It isn't nearly as smooth/quick to switch between servers and channels as it used to be.,3
com.discord,SkyWolf Hero,"Its so glitchy now what happened. Ever since the new update it crashes when I take photos to send, images just dissappear, it just doesn't work and is so frustrating.",1
com.discord,philip danks,New update has ruined this app! Stop fixing what isn't broken. It's now impossible to upload files without Nitro because compression doesn't work any more. 8MB file limit in 2022 is rediculous! Replying is harder since you've changed the press and hold feature to remove the animation so you never know if you're pressing the correct message. Can't send a photo because it dpesnt uplpad and comes up with an error! Terrible user experience. Gets more frustrating every day. Negative 100 review,1
com.discord,Cindane Tepish,My account got disabled without violating any of the terms of service when I contacted customer support they told me to reset my password when I told them that I was unable to reset the password i got no response im still waiting for a response. It's been going on about 3 weeks now they still have not responded to me despite sending them emails every day I never received an email telling me that my account was disabled and I was never told what I did wrong. Discord is a complete waste of time.,1
com.discord,Aiman Nurhakim Baharudin,"Worse update ever. Please revert back to the old one. The text is unnecessarily huge, the emote selection filled up the entire screen, which makes split screen even worse, and some of my friend's profile picture, stickers and emotes just never loaded. I know my connection is good but Discord just doesn't seem to agree to that.",1
com.discord,Kitty Lynne,"This app is terrible. I have to force stop it to load new messages and to allow me to react to messages every. single. day. In the last update they said, ""we heard you, android users,"" but I don't know what they heard because it never got better!",1
com.discord,Sam M.,"NEWST BUG: you can't oploade videos (even below 8 mb they ""compress"" the video and somehow destroying the file because it gets below 1mb and can't ve opened) -- -- old: Below Mediocre app. Buggy and continues pop-ups (GO GET NITRO PREMIUM or what ever it's called.

com.discord,Freya,"this new update.. absolutely HORRENDOUS. there was absolutely no reason to change. the new ui is clunky and crowded. it runs so much slower, no more seamless transitions between channels and servers, now taking several seconds to switch. most of the time opening the app after using another one results in a few seconds of the connecting message on top. the search function no longer has endless scrolling, can't look at larger convos through it anymore theres so much more I want to say I cant fit",2
com.discord,Abegail Gabine,"few bugs(?) I encountered with the recent update: -there are different 'style' of emojis appeared on bio and status than that of text channels. -""connecting..."" keeps appearing at the top of the chat although internet is stable. -clips only play audio even if tapped or enlarge, though internet is stable. -user was often inaudible with mic on in a voice channel. -user volume UI is too small that you can't adjust them sometimes. -user's name on vc was cut if many user are on the same call.",3
com.discord,Lucid Diluca,"I can't even use reactions anymore. How am I supposed to join servers with reaction verification when I can't use reactions. The permanent auto emoji pisses me off. You can't get rid of the love screen on your phone when you are watching a live, it just stays there in the way of everything. Drives me absolute mad",1

com.discord,Sophie Beckett,"What happened? Past few updates loads of things seem to be missing from the sidebar and have to uninstall/reinstall for them to show up again each time.

com.discord,A Google user,"Wow, this new update is abysmal. Text is too clumped together and changing the size just mangles the whole app. Some channel names are deemed ""too long"" so they only show as elipses despite being fine before, plus it snaps me back to certain channels constantly. Also completely overwrote my notification settings and setting them back is a pain because most are duplicated. Not good.",1
com.discord,H e a t h e r,"the app was great, although my bug is about the update. i updated the app, only to see that now, whenever i go to ""browse photos"", it directs me to my internal files. the internal files are very tedious when it comes to searching for photos, the photos are scattered across folders and it takes me 30 mins to find the photo i was looking for. it's very annoying, is there a possible way where i can switch what gallery/photo app discord uses when browsing photos?",2
com.discord,Ivva M,"It's annoying that the app works well ""when it wants to"". Sometimes calls are smooth, other times everything is sh**, audio is terrible and it says there is no connection (even tho the Internet connection is stable and working). When or if you fix it, I'll change my review. Forgot to add that sometimes on call, instead of showing the time spent on call, I get shown 1/1/1970 Edit: I tried everything, even tried mobile data. Nothing helps, it's you :)",1
com.discord,Christian Wayne Salomes,"Everything is right. And yet everything is wrong. The new update really made discord unusable. I can't even join voice chats without restarting the app 5 times.

com.discord,Xen Versace,"Hello. I've been using discord for quite a while now. I've stopped using other social medias because discord was very swift and smooth and was much easy to gather with people online. But after the update, everything changed. The layout is terrible. The texts fiercely pop up instead of the smooth popping up before. GIFS won't load and everything is so much more slower. Banners don't load either. Please revert back to the old layout. We don't need changes that'd make us hesitant to use discord.",1

com.discord,Autumn,"I used to love this app, but now I'm just getting continuously ticked off at it. There are tons of bots and harmful people on this app, and the only attempted automated system to defend against harmful people only punishes people who are using the app for it's intended purpose. I can't hold multiple conversations without being temp banned from the app, despite having a clean record with Discord. Really hope this gets fixed asap.",3
com.discord,Aung Pyae Oo,"Nice App for community and effective communication. Really disrupt the whole IM Platforms and Social Media Platforms with simple grouping and hashtags!!!

com.discord,Petra Petra,"The new update is just downgrade for sure. Its just getting harder to use, ex: image name is not appear when you tap the image/gif, gif file doesn't play automatically when it appears on ""new"" search tab so you must tap the msg and jump to msg to play it. Like really? This is the best we get? Its just the more complicated than the old one for real. Brand new is not always be good tbh.",1
com.discord,Jennifer Peter Daunus,I really love discord and would give it a 5 star but this current update is extremely bad. My discord doesn't operate as smoothly as before now there's like a couple second glitch everytime I want to view a new server or dm. Everything else works well but that few second lag isn't nice. Anytime I use discord after the update it almost feels like I am using PC discord with all server notifications on.,3
com.discord,Chi (Weeb Trash),"The app was perfectly fine up until the lastest update which made changes that literally did not need to happen and definitely made using the app a little more difficult Now, image scaling is weird, the overall app is slow and clunky, the changes in text size personally made it more difficult to use and make 0 sense, I could go on about the issues I'm having If you can, it's worth reverting to the previous version because this genuinely sucks lol (and I'm trying to be as nice as I can)",2
com.discord,Ambient,"Overall this is a very good app for trying to find a community of people with aimilar interests. I give it one star less than 5 though because of the inability to hide chat channels on clientside, as there have been chat rooms in servers that I would have liked better to not exist to me.",4
com.discord,Se√°n,Bring back the ability to see the time at which messages were sent. That was a terrible decision to remove it and it has ruined the app for me when I otherwise really liked it.,1

com.discord,Savant,"Would have given a 4/5 before the current update. Now my bluetooth keyboard can't be set to submit-on-enter like it used to, so i have to shift to the screen submit button every time i want to submit a line. That plus the frequent graphical glitches and non-collapsing side panels in split screen mode on my tablet make it a huge decrease in usability.",1
com.discord,Shakly Daydream,"Update 3: It just keeps getting worse. I see there was a minor revamping to Discord on mobile devices and now it's constantly laggy, freezing or crashing. I've had none of these problems on a constant basis previously. I don't understand what you're doing.",2
com.discord,Darren Jackson,"Ive been using this app for years now. The new update made it hard to scroll up without accidentally opening the sidebars. Instead of sliding and just staying there unless you swipe again, its just slippery. I dont like it. The new UI looks great, especially the photo picker, its so much easier for me to browse. But like other reviews, when i type on my keyboard it just feeezes for a second. Im glad this isnt just a me thing. Anyway, thanks for updating and making the UI look nice :) /gen",2

Of course to get the other emoji's you have to get nitro, and we are just not that interested in them. We primarily use text chat and do have multiple channels within our main group.

Also, Discord, stop telling people to submit feedback on your site. You know you messed up, own up to it and revert the entire update.

com.discord,Ippiki √ïkami (Lone wolf),"I just had a bright idea, something that needs adding to ToS, cuz gamers have respect for one another, you should have a buddy system for those with a low mental age to be paired with people with similar interests to help them avoiding the threats of scams like many I've seen recently and occasionally get a laugh from... mostly because it's not nice to target those fellow people, even if it's to check they're OK and not gonna be scammed, and make it a rule that it's more if they need the advice",4
com.discord,Mitsuki Morow,"lates update sucks on phone, biggest mistake to update it tbh, desktop version is great, but i cant even see if my friends are online or not and logos (what do you call those that you use to see your friends, mentions on servers, and your settings) they dont seem to come out and i cant see my nitro nor my background) its honestly confusing now and the app is laggy",1

com.discord,Amirul Ezzat Ismail,"The new update shatters the performance greatly. It could've been simpler update but it is a technical ui overhaul update to the point it became practically a hassle for me to navigate. But as the gamers nowadays would say, ""skill-issue"". I'm a boomer now.",4
com.discord,Ria,It use to be so good but now there are so many bugs everytime I am in call on my phone and try to use another or just get out of the app on accident it disconnects me in a second it's so annoying because I can use any other app if I am on a call from my phone,2
com.discord,JRH esquire.,"Great functionality, visually polished UX although could be a lot more intuitive and less frustrating, as could On-boarding, signposting and insights. Needs the ability to prioritise channels and servers. Paid features are overly complex and diluted. This could however be 'baked in' purposely and if so the rating would be two instead of four. Overall a good app with lots of potential. My review may seem padantic as mobile UX is one of my expertise.",4
com.discord,Burkle,"The app is great. It has all the features you could ever want (plus more). Sometimes there's bugs, but they almost always get fixed pretty quickly.",4

This issue persisted for 3+ versions by now, and I've tried various troubleshooting steps to no avail. Please help! | Edit: I submitted a bug report. Thank you so much for the quick response!",3
com.discord,Flair,I absolutely hate the new update. I can't use :) bc it goes to üôÇ and it's Annoying. Used to be able to flip my phone UPSIDE down now I can't. when I type it doesn't fallow the letters. Instead it just stays where it's at so I can't see what I'm typing. Hate this app now only have it for freinds ect. As soon as I open it it crashed did this 10 times 5 before I turned my phone off and back on then 5 more after still won't open.,1
com.discord,Dylan Wilson,"I have no idea why others are having issues with the update, as mine is working perfectly and same goes for my server everyone has reported no changes or issues with there version of the update. Anyway great update no issues also maybe try adding some of the ideas people talk about in the reviews.",5
com.discord,Gabriel Davila,"Often my calls are pretty consistent with the audio and while sometimes it does cut out and we heard Discordanese (choppy audio speech joke), it's usually resolved after hanging up and calling again.

Thanks discord, I owe you one.",5

com.discord,Marcus Karlsson (Chikumo),"This latest update is requiring I allow the phone to have my phone contact data and to be able to connect to nearby devices if I want to connect to a voice call with my phone, claiming to not have mic permissions.. One is a breach of privacy, the second a security risk. Why would I accept either?! Edit: Yes I still have the issues, I've now had to reinstall the older version of discord twice to keep functionality BCS it auto updates even if I've disabled auto updates through the app store..",2
com.discord,Jay Malanyaon,Fairly easy to use once you got the hand of it. Connecting with your friends and talking to them is made easy. Basically been using discord everyday afer I discovered it.,5
com.discord,Adil Uddin,After the new React Native update text channel switching sometimes breaks where old channel is stuck but the new channel unread status is cleared. More weird changes with notifications (which haven't been working for months anyway). Very much dislike these new set of changes. Animations are also sluggish and have motion blur for displays above 60Hz. Maybe it's time to give Guilded another go. ü§î,1
com.discord,Alex Markov,It's kinda hard work on mobile and some functions were kinda better before the update. Many functions like saving new changes and all this don't appear and it's hard to make new stuff in your server.,4
com.discord,Brammirza Rizaldy,Somehow I experienced quite an annoying bug after the latest UI update. The inability to share website pages or youtube videos directly to discord through the share button (need to manually copy and paste the link for it to work). Also experiencing crashes sometimes. I have updated the app to the latest version and my phone is running SD865 which should be more than capable running the app. Please fix the issue. Thankyou.,3
com.discord,Joshua Altenbeck,"Normally great, however the recent update make the ui janky (the far left strip of my screen is constantly brighter than the rest, switching channels by accident just by tapping the screen while trying to type) especially the image and file uploads. It used to be that tiny thumbnails would pop up when selecting images or files, representing each file, and it wouldn'tinterfere with anything. Now absolutely Giant thumbnails obscure the selection screen, pushing it down to a tiny unusable strip",2
com.discord,Ian (Pizkwat),Been using for years. Very good for large groups. Has an option to adjust the volume at which you receive individual people in a call.,4
com.discord,Sam Anson,"The latest update to the Android app absolutely trashed the accessibility settings, making all fonts on the screen completely different sizes (from comically ant sized to gigantic). There is only 1 slider to adjust the font and it only works on the message body itself, meaning the ui is literally rendered inaccessible. This needs fixing fast.",1
com.discord,Sakura Shark „Åï„Åè„Çâ „Ç∑„É£„Éº„ÇØ Ch.,"The new app update actually made it harder to navigate through chats, sometimes the screen would be stuck and you'd have a hard time swiping from left to right to try to fix it just to see the whole messages whole, the UI was already better before the update since it didn't have much issues, normally I don't mind changes, but only if the changes made things easier, this one legit made it harder to check server chats, it's clunky, tight and clusterphobic",1
com.discord,Todd S,"Have had serious performance issues since the latest update was released: 1. When opening a server, the channel that opens is consistently empty for a minimum of 3 seconds and the interface is unresponsive until messages load 2. Sharing content to discord: the channel list is sometimes empty, channels much be searched by name 3. Sometimes after sharing to a channel, (1.) occurs and the ""loading messages"" screen is overlayed on top of messages after they're loaded The UI update is fine.",2
com.discord,Jakob Morgan,"Discord has more technical problems than any other chat app I've ever used, and now they've also given Android users a far inferior experience because they're lazy. I have to do so many dumb workarounds just to make the app work. They can't get out of their own way.",2
com.discord,Benji,With the current update discord doesn't know how to detect and switch to new connecting Bluetooth audio device. Forcing you to end call/leaving voice chat to just activate your Bluetooth headphones.,1
com.discord,Scott Yeager,What a shocker! Here's another negative review on the most recent update to discords Android app. Ever since the app started forcing compression of videos uploaded (please discord... Tell me why a 2mb video needs further compression??????) the app now yeets the audio of your uploads to just white noise static.,1
com.discord,Mei√∏sei Chan,"The new update is so ugly- this ain't it. I've been a discord user for years, the notification system was fine and the layout was good the way it was. until the lastest update. there is this seperate page for notifications and a ""for you"" and i hate it. ive had several prople complain about the new design- the bold fonts and how everything looks enlarged. GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS IM BEGGING! Also it doesn't tell you when someone's typing anymore. the link to profile feature is cool though.",2
com.discord,Harley Snodgrass,"Quality application on every device. Discord has replaced most applications and services I use for communicating with my friends who are spread out across the US. We've had server channels for years through discord with many great memories and more to come. Stay beautiful, Discord dev team.",5
com.discord,Xenobia Darkstar,This app is terrible and gets worse. They stopped supporting old versions so you are forced to use this one without fixing any of the problems mainly the ones with the notifications.,1
com.discord,Ayome Diamond,"The app is good but I have one problem. One of my accounts doesn't have an email and I tried to get back into it. It tells me ""New Log-In Detected, Please Check Your E-mail."" If you could fix that it would be appreciated! Everything else is fine.",4
com.discord,Leopold,"Has reduced recently. Every time I stream gameplay, the stream will freeze on the devices of those watching, whether on PC or mobile. Have tried using different versions but it hasn't improved.",3
com.discord,Federico Reichenbach,"Edit: update made performance awful and overall experience became very clunky, with no useful feature added. No idea how this got past beta. Please roll back. Discord as a service is great, the app however isn't. There are lots of issues as someone who uses two accounts for different purposes. The switch account feature that recently got added to desktop is still missing from mobile. Notifications break often and don't get out. The app is also not perfectly stable. Some fixes needed.",1
com.discord,Ck,Great app. Its such a nice way to connect with friends on the go. I have issues sometimes where it constantly says connecting until I turn it off.,4

com.discord,Lucian Villaflores,I love this app for communication but porting the iOS version of the app to Android just makes everyone's lives so much more difficult. Everyone's saying there's a lot more bug issues with that version. I've been using the latest version before the iOS port to avoid this. Please bring back the unique Android client.,3
com.discord,Julianna Duque,"pls bring back to old version of this! Its so hard to use! its the only app that doesnt work well since it updates. Its lagged and so slow even tho u have strong wifi, kept saying password and email is invalid!",1

com.discord,Shaddow_pet,Was good until they began to co statnly require me to update the app. I liked the old app but now they done went if fixed an that wasnt broke and i hate this new version. The old app was more convenient and useful. But now they are adding so much stupid stuff that isnt really needed. They forgot quality over quantity was a thing apparently,2
com.discord,Wilma Nielsen,"This last update has made the app generally more unresponsive, and even something as simple as swiping to open the server menu misreads a lot more often as scrolling in the chat. The channels on the sidemenu have also been made much shorter with no option to undo this change in the options. This seems like a terrible overlook for people who have difficulty clicking the channels. The rework of the emote picker I find good however overall this update made things worse Might cancel sub at this rate",2
com.discord,Muhammad Zain Ali Free Fire,"Hello! I love your app. Its very great to chat but the problem im having is make a new update. We can set on our phone to ""Playing (your text).

Idk why you're even reading this, download it already.",5
com.discord,Pranjal,"When I used this app in 2021 everything seemed well and fine but when I installed it in 2022 it seemed like it's a bit annoying to use idk why, a small change in the system was made and that's the reason my discord glitches.

com.discord,Kayla Conner,I haven't been able to get notifications for a month now on Android 12 and help has not been able able offer any solution. They also removed my old review so I guess I'll leave a new one about how bad and money hungry the app is to never fix my issues and just get worse while making more and more features paid.,1
com.discord,Luke Cantu,Everything is fine but I will admit that the calls tend to lose connection randomly. Also not being notified about any messages at time's is a hassle.,4
com.discord,Helena R,"This new update really ruined everything for me tbh. I don't mind discord adding new features, as long as they don't mess with the current layout and stuff. But here we go. The text channels are super cramped, when someone sends a message and you're in a different chat, the pop up does not look like previously. It's just messy and an eyesore",1
com.discord,Brohamicus Porkins,"Loved discord but I hadn't updated it in a while and when I did it was slower and it looked quite different all the ui, all the text, no way to revert anything. And my notifications didnt drop-down automatically when outside of the app. Can no longer put a spoiler on any of my images.",1

com.discord,Thomas Richmond,This new update sucks balls here's why some of the files or memes I post like a Wii Demoman have static noise basically audio that sounds different but when I go to my files it's fine it's also annoying how on mobile you have watch another video for a set period of time before you can watch the one you wanted to watch it's so bad tbh it used to be better and it needs some changes and sometimes when my memes I'm sending are about to be posted it crashes my discord so please discord team fix this,3
com.discord,Bagus Ariiq,"The latest update hase messed everything up, i know you guys work hard for it (maybe) but maybe try reverting it to the previous version.

com.discord,Justin Scobie,"Discord has long been in my mind as the best in class for chat/comms apps but since this latest update which is supposedly a bloated unoptimised iOS version force ported to Android, it's a Teams grade buggy mess.

Profile backgrounds load infinitely. Swiping left/right to registers as up/down more often than not.",1

com.discord,Matt,The last update messed up discord. It worked great before they just copied/pasted ios discord onto Android. It doesn't load every DM or discord. It won't let me react to posts. It doesn't send notifications. It buffers. It is trash now.,1
com.discord,Loren Ni√±a Basig,I decided to update it coz my old version app suddenly won't work anymore and I think that was intentional to force us to update. Too many unnecessary things were added. Done reading? check out #next channel.,1

com.discord,Jeldert de Bildt,"Worked great before the last update, now I keep getting flooded with messages from 50 or so servers and only managed to stop that by turning all notifications off. Aside from that I can't hide the sidebars anymore and the small keyboard doesn't work anymore, only the in app one can be used. the message problem can be fixed by deleting the app fully, as the update installs phantom discord with notifications on.",3
com.discord,Simo Ahola,"You can't change Input or Output device, you can't seem to be able to open inbox like in the desktop version. New update removed other settings aswell, the fact you can't change the audio device makes the app unusable for calls, I really don't understand that such a basic thing is missing. Also their web app has the changing of OUTPUT device disable for no other apparent reason than to get you download this inferior app... So frustrating when your daily driver is an android device......",1
com.discord,Sam Frame,"I've been using discord for just probably around 5 years, it's been great. I've met friends, and even some best friends that I'm going to meet irl. the only reason I put 4 stars is because the app can be a bit glitchy at times, nothing big enough to make me hate it or stop using it.",4
com.discord,Storm,"This most recent update has been horrendous. Who messed up the UI this badly? The text is either too small or too big, the zoom function is broken, I find that connecting to the server takes forever and often doesn't work, and the app has become an extreme battery hog.",1
com.discord,Rhys Davis (PHaNtoM),"A great application let down by poor designing. The new update is rather slow. When updating the role order it takes ages for it to load, this is the same for channel ordering. As well as the above issues, I can no longer add emojis to channel names or category names after creating them. Going from one server to another or going from interface to interface is noticeably slower from the older design.

com.discord,C.A.T.S Central,Pretty good. Only thing is that it can be annoying to receive a ping when you wanna @ someone so maybe a feature that will @ them but they won't get a notification until they open discord. Aside from that 10/10,5
com.discord,Pathikrit Ghosh,It was so good before. You guys ruined all your hard work with this new updates. Its a very big downgrade on what u had. I'm disappointed. I'm a discord user for years and this is the time I really feel like not using the app anymore. The bots are harder to use. The channels are congested. Pings stay even when they are checked. Having problems to jump to messages. Having to press 2-3 more times to reply or react. Have to save multiple times to change nickname in servers. I'm really disappointed.,1
com.discord,Master Sweet,"I've been using this app 5 years and this is the absolute worst update. It feels slow, pictures take a lot to load and it's full of bugs.

Every action feels wonky. Sending images just straightup crashes discord or freezes it permanently.

Enough lag that sometimes messages wouldn't show, UI so small it looks like it was made for ants and a very lazy developer just porting the iOS version over to Android (which is what this is!)

com.discord,Ahmet Hakan Ko√ß,"My initial review was 5 stars, but now I have to lower it to 2 because of this new update that basically ruined the app for me and my friends. What's gotten worse, you ask? The input detection has gotten worse, the app loads things slowly on the backgrounds which causes it to lag on the slightest movements, and media takes way longer to send. Discord, please either fix these issues or revert to the previous version, then I'll give you 5 stars again. Edit: Of course the dev response is a bot...",2
com.discord,Cannon Burton,I have been using discord for years and years. It has made my gaming experience with friends amazing! The UI and general look is great and easy to use! I will likely be using discord until the day I die. 100% would recommend.,5

com.discord,Uma Chatterjee,"It used to be great, but as everyone seems to agree the new update isn't doing any good ‡≤•_‡≤• I don't use the web version specifically because it's slower and less convenient, and the newest update is so buggy, so laggy, has stopped working once, and is just overall not a good idea. Please, either go back to the older version or give us a way to downgrade ourselves, making mobile more like the web version isn't a good choice from any angle ü•≤",1
com.discord,Pluto Jupiter,I've had discord for a few years now and I use it to chat with my friends every single day. BEST APP EVER. You can go and have voice chats with your friends and it's awesome. Couldn't recommend enough,5
com.discord,AnthonyGamelandYT,"Definitely a great app, especially on the PC version. But they are some bugs that I have have encountered once or twice, the channels on one of the servers disappeared.

com.discord,Hirobian,"As of August2022, the UI has endured significant changes that nobody asked for and that are overwhelmingly negatively received by the community. Discord team, please revert the changes. The new UI does not work well, everything is laggy and clunky. I use the app in landscape mode and the left sidebar locks open, it never did this before, I now lose one third of my reading space and emojis are partially inaccessible. Functionality that used to work fine now slow me down and are irritating.",1

com.discord,NEJ KOMO (Kill me),"Ngl chief, this update is horrible. It's buggy as hell and looks like trash. Revent images wouldn't show up unless I picked *see all*, but when I selected a picture the app rebooted. So I uninstall, well, try to, and it caused my phone to freak out and restart itself, almost going into recovery mode, which I have never seen before. Maybe look into this?",1
com.discord,Tomas E. Caram,"The app logs me off after every update, which is a problem because I use a yubikey for 2fa and is a pain to keep logging in again. After the last update it hangs during login even after clearing cache and reinstalling. App is broken. Update: Issue still exists",1
com.discord,One Is The Loneliest Number,"Every single complaint i made about the beta version hasnt been adressed when pushed to the live version, in fact now i notice it absolutely draining my battery, glitching out videos, either by making them play when they shouldnt or just not showing video at all, fonts are still ugly as to look at, app feels slow and clunky. Im just glad that the desktop version isnt completely ruined already",1
com.discord,Exotics,Ever since I updated it I can't stop discord from auto using emojis whenever I use :) I get a full on emoji and I can't stop it I even went into the setting and it's not there to get rid of it so whats going on? I really don't like the auto emoji feature it keeps getting in my way.,1
com.discord,EZ64cool,Some aspects are pretty far behind compared to the desktop version and it doesn't handle an unstable connection very well considering it's meant to be used on mobile roaming networks. But discord is discord so 4/5 is fair,4
com.discord,John George Stephen,The new update is garbage the keyboard keeps popping open when scrolling. It adds reactions to messages when you click reply or opens a thread to the reply. Videos won't play in the app you either have to download them or click the link. Adding photos is no longer infinite scrolling you have to access file manager after a certain amount of scrolling down. The appearance is rubbish too it's like old android bubbles. Connection issues require app force closed terrible update please change it back.,1
com.discord,Oz,"Ever since I updated the app it has been performing terribly, it will not send my messages due to the app refusing to connect to the internet despite having full bars and never having this issue before, photos and gifs will be black unless I restart the app and videos do not work at all and I will have to restart the app up to six times to be able to watch a nine second video.",1
com.discord,Brittany Johns,"Would have been five stars but the new update is sooooo laggy. I have to wait for the rest of my message to load for far to long in my opinion. Once an app i used as primary means to speak with family and friends now feels like a hassle. Im hopeful that this can be fixed but for now 2 Stars is all i can give. (i have tried both Wifi and data and it's the same) switching servers, sending messages and even receiving notifications are all very delayed compared to the apps previously.",2
com.discord,Stephanie Brooks,I love this app. It has always been good for me. I am giving a 4 star because as of recent updates I can no longer save the app to my SD card. I would really appreciate if I could put the app back on my SD card.,4

com.discord,Samantha Ira Sor,"A lot of bugs happened ever since I've updated, it's annoying. The overlay is delayed (my pfp lights up late when I'm talking) and it only shows my pfp (it should be showing the pfp of whoever is talking), and the icon of buttons in overlay are missing. When I'm in the app, keyboard always pops up even though I'm trying to remove it. Back reading became difficult because there's no new messages pop-up on the top anymore. Please fix these, thank you.",2

com.discord,CH Anderson,"The new update sucks and heres why: -My discord used to have fully customized text. The new update reset that and now the only control is text size. -The ""jump to bottom"" button now scrolls instead of jumps, which just wastes time. -My phone keyboard keeps bugging out. This only happens in discord and didnt happen before. -Gifs dont load half the time. -When scrolling far up or down, theres a ""show more messages"" button, which you must click to continue. Before, you could scroll uninterrupted.",2
com.discord,Manny Valenzuela,"Updates come and the downloading issue is still there. Every time i try to download and save a video on the app, it ends up corrupted and can't be viewed.",1
com.discord,Avery Floral,"Also agreeing with everyone regarding the new UI being too squished together. Hate that the new message animation has disappeared, it was much easier on the eyes than a new message just popping up in front of you. I have a glitch that makes all DMs appear as empty/brand new before it loads the conversation history. This did not happen before. I went back to version 126.21",1
com.discord,Austin Seyed,"This new update for android is trash. Slow, clunky, images dont load properly, and theyre cropped unless I click on them. Emotes, user id tags, etc arent highlighted in chat. You somehow, overnight, managed to make this app feel like a beta version of itself. Edit: Videos don't load, either. You need to revert this update. EDIT: I have nitro, uploading a 22 mb vid. Gives me an error saying 100 mb is the maximum. Review will remain one star.",1
com.discord,Nephilim Thotian,"Ok Discord devs do you really have to involve RNG to play or load photos and videos? That's the literal problem that this app is currently having, the *polishing* that you people have provided for the app has clearly made it even twice as worse, the UI of the app has more bugs on android that of comparing to apple which clearly benifits them more than most android users who constantly use this app. Please just fix this issue that this app is currently havingüíÄ",2

com.discord,Nuris Alhakim,"Bug fix? What bug fix? Previous version worked just fine. Latest update had even more bugs. Videos won't show even when the sound played. Only blank screen with play button showed up. The font is also beginning to be annoying. Plus, it also now opens chatrooms at the bottom instead of the position of the last opened message.",1
com.discord,Sonja (Nevrdiel),"Can we just roll back the last update? 'Cause right now the app is just annoying. GIFs aren't loading properly, just black images or really wonky in size.

I do like the new more condensed sidebar look though.",3
com.discord,Jeremy Killam,"This app has gone from a 5 star to a 2 star over the years. It seems every update features are removed, moved, changed, replaced. The UI is constantly changed, the colours and boldness of things like notifications changing. Discord UI peaked a while ago, all further changes are a degredation or targeted at an imaginary audience. People should not be punished with a disgusting UI. If the course isn't corrected, users will be forced to migrate to alternatives.",2
com.discord,soft vinnie (Molly),"New update is AWFUL and the categories are clumped together, it also changes long channel names to '...' and it runs slower for me with all the extra animations.

Honestly, in my opinion the old UI was much more preferred, and easier to use. I can't remember my other problems, but I do want to know what you folks thought you were fixing here. For the next update, please don't muck with my font settings again.",2

com.discord,Jennifer Hussey,Removing the ability to automatically compress images on mobile is evil. If an app is on my phone I should be able to send pictures taken with my phone without any issue. But no of course not because my phone takes pictures bigger than 8mb. Nothing is more annoying than having to compress an image myself to send it. I cant think of another app on my phone that wont just let me send pictures I take to friends. Shameful. Let me revert to old versions or bring this feature back.,1

All my text faces ("":P"" and "":)"") are autocorrected to actual emojis, and when I DO want to react to messages with emojis I now have to scroll all the way past every server to the default emojis all the way at the bottom.

Disappointing.",1

com.discord,Randy Faulk,Great app. Use it everyday. One thing I would like in the mobile app is the feature that is on the desktop app. The ability to see your what friends are in whi h server at a glance in the friends section.,4
com.discord,TheGugaJeans,"New update crashes phone on every step, cant send messages, cant send pictures. Not to mention it looks horrible.

Other than that application function quite well. Developer please fix this issue! I will gladly give you 4-5 stars if I could USE it.,1
com.discord,Hannah Roque,"Like always it was better before the update, the app is more laggy now and it's getting bothersome. The font look kind of weird and the notifications bar is just downright annoying (I keep on looking at it when I'm typing because the blue line is distracting, I liked it when it just showed up like a normal notification without a timer) it feels as if the app downgraded a bit. I gave 2 stars because i still like this app but the update is making me hard to like it.",2

com.discord,Casey Wang,"changing my review given this new update. this UI is a UX disaster. the font sizes are different and look bolder, line heights tighter, and personally, i'm not a fan of the compact channels. this looks like an unoptimised iOS discord port to android. there's noticeable lag when opening the app because messages won't load for a good 20sec. sometimes lag with typing input. i wouldn't have minded the change if it were better implemented. please take the word of your users seriously.",2

com.discord,Fabian Tejera,"Very useful app, and is very organized too. It also has little extra features that normal messaging apps don't have.",5
com.discord,lovelyluxian,I love discord but why did they have to remove classic nitro and replace it with basic? I think classic nitro is better since it's a balance of feattures and money and for bassic you can only send emojis. I don't think that's the main point because personally I love nitro because of the profile themes and also the emojis,4

com.discord,Zach Casino,"The recent update of discord has been nothing but problems for me. The new video playing is very annoying because a slight movement will stop the video or a new message from another person will stop the video from playing.

com.discord,Benjamin Nightingale (Ben),"Most recent update, where you revamped the mobile experience and UI a bit, has been pretty buggy. Just experienced a bug where I went into one of my discord servers and the conversation was frozen on the last server chat room I was in, even when I switched.

com.discord,Mr Goose,"With the new update ‚Äî specifically for android ‚Äî it has brought on a hundred new bugs, implications and honestly just damn annoying things.

Cam turns off if i leave the app which is a good addition but if im live streaming and i want it on i cant let it stay on.

com.discord,Max,I really like discord but it feels kinda slow on mobile. On pc it's alright though. I think it just needs some optimizing and bug fixes. Over all a great app.,4

com.discord,Jan ‚ÄúAbelardo‚Äù van Popta,"With the last update Discord has switched their codebase to the react native. While it is nice that we get feature parity with other platforms now, that does not change the fact that the apps performance went from best in class to just bad. Stutters and frame drops constantly, formerly animated things are now static, UI has been slightly downgraded, Pixel phones lost the camera quick share shortcut among others. This upgrade feels like a downgrade in usability. I prefer slower updates to this.",3

com.discord,Hannah Lemon,Honestly my favorite platform to communicate on because I can edit my messages. None of the other platforms that I use do that. It's just super easy to use and the only reason I won't give it a 5 is because sometimes it has glitches.,4
com.discord,Noah Radford,Have to pay for higher res and fps streaming and to customize banners. Not really a selling point in my opinion just seems like a cheap cash grab as other free apps allow for high res and fps captures/streaming for free other than that it's a decent chat and call app,2

com.discord,Lil different,"This app went from a 5 stars to a 1 star so quick- It updated against my choice and now it's more similar version which me and multiple do not like.

com.discord,Banan a,"yikes, new ui is incredibly buggy and many setting options are now missing cause of it. everything is slower and looks worse, how do i roll back to an older version",1
com.discord,Vlad Mali,"Great app, lots of improvements; good for regular calls or video meetings, not to mention the ability to play or chat with your friends and communicate in real time üôÇüëç",5
com.discord,Zedrick Vitug,"App turned really bad with the new look. It's clunky, buggy, and it looks awful overall. I had to downgrade because the new versions are straight up unbearably annoying and slow when the older versions are much more smoother. New Discord ran so bad it felt like I was using an iPhone 4 running Android Jellybean",1
com.discord,Eliza Luca,This stupid update makes the app freeze on random channels. Sometimes even crashing. How many times do you have to break your own app with the new updates....,1
com.discord,Fire_shark_2.0,"I'm using discord all the time. I like how is not like Facebook full of moms and grandmas that are sending cards all the time. It is great for streaming to friends and chating with them. Also you can find some servers on TikTok and if is small or even if is big you can chat with people with the same interests and chat with them all the time, it is fun and cool. I used Viber as a app to contact with friends when you playing and Discord is 100 tims better then Viber. I recommend too much 11-28 ig.",5
com.discord,Legendary Gamer,"Idk what it is, or more like why it is It feels like we r getting worse and worse with every update. Like, UI was just fine before but now almost everything feels clunky. Pls, just go back to the way it was. That experience was way better than this one.",1
com.discord,Omega EH,"The keyboard keeps popping up!!! Please fix this bug! In fact, the old version was much better.",2
com.discord,Landon James,"All over discord, i cannot react to any message now. That meaning react to a message with emojis. Its hard getting roles and stuff and its actually kind of frustrating.",3
com.discord,Zaelynn Noeau,I guess this app is good but for some reason I don't know but I try signing into my account but it ain't working and having so much trouble and I'm getting frustrated with you discord üòñü•∫,3
com.discord,Twist uwu,"The latest visual update is a disaster. Bigger everything makes for cluttered chats and interfaces, as if adding way more buttons weren't enough. Call, video call, threads, attachments, user list and Nitro gifts (which itself is a terrible button choice): all of these for a simple DM. I literally can't see the DM's name because of how everything is bundled up. Amazingly disappointing and frustrating UI for an app that should just look clean and concise.",1
com.discord,Crafty Cooper,Slowly but surely they are fixing the bugs that I had such trouble with on my last review. It's only getting better and better. Discord has become my top form of mobile communication.,5
com.discord,CatNoir lover,Don't download this app. The new update is soo horrible for Android user. I suggest you download it after they bring back the older version before the new update comes. Its soo slow and barely smooth unlike the version before this. DANG if only i didn't update the app before knowing the update is not good,1
com.discord,Joseph Stalin,"New update is absolute garbage each time I open the app it acts like I got poor wifi connection or poor data connection it keeps trying to ""connect"" to its own servers. I've never had this much issues until the recent update from gifs failing to work to media upload that does upload but doesn't appear on your personal end unless you close the app and re-open it. Fix your stuff Discord you clearly aren't doing anything on the ""daily"" as you claim you are because it would be fixed already",1
com.discord,Wigity Man,"Live video calls constantly pause. Have to drop video and go back in to fix for maybe 2 more min of uniterrupted calling. Very jank update, update before last was perfectly fine.",1
com.discord,caces,"Its a great app, but the thing is when i try to select a image/video to a friend, the app just freezes and gets stuck. It gets very stuck. Is there a solution to this?",3
com.discord,Mahmoud Elesawee,"Hi, I hope that you are all fine, please I would like if you could remove the last 3 or 4 updates, scrolling, loading and even reading messages has become very annoying, DM notifications stopped working and with out a server ping, I can't know that my friend has sent me 20 lines of text in my direct convosation without checking the app over and over and over again.",5
com.discord,Just Kevin,"The video compression on mobile makes all my uploaded video files a loud static mess. The app is fine otherwise, but this static bug is an actual audio hazard.",2
com.discord,Alex Tyan,"I absolutely hate the new update, the size difference of text is horrible, the different size of the channel bar is awful and worst of all the notifications while in the app. Please revert to the previous version! it was running smoothly and was perfect and now you've gone and ruined it all üò´",1
com.discord,Mau shu,"I'm having trouble trying to send photos. It takes too long to compress the images. Overall, everything is fine abd easy to use.",4
com.discord,Padfoot922,App is completely broken. Since when is 4.72mb larger then 8mb? Still has problems with 108 megapixel photos. Trash.,1
com.discord,strongsong _117,"Recent update for the mobile app's been really buggy that I have to restart the app constantly. When I lock my phone while in-app and then use it, it'll have trouble connecting and sending messages even though my wifi and internet is good, making me restart it. Sometimes even if I start the app fresh, the servers are invisible and the loading time is too long, so I'll have to restart again. ‡≤†_‡≤† Please fix this.",3
com.discord,lego batman,"accidentally got nitro after a free trial despite me remembering for certain i opted out. contacted customer support and i was supposedly ""refunded"" its been longer than the alleged date and i still havent gotten the refund. on top of all this my account was also disabled with no response from support. scum.",1
com.discord,Alex Sutliff,"Latest major update is AWFUL. Every time you get a message it flags it as unread even while you are in currently in a chat with the person who messaged, the new color is a harsh neon purple reminiscent of the TextNow app, everything takes longer to load, the interface doesn't always load in properly, videos don't load, font is too small to read, just bugs bugs bugs. Why they thought it was a good idea to downgrade to this ugly, unstable mess is anyone's guess.",1
com.discord,‚Ä¢ Rosamie ‚Ä¢,I can't tell if it's a bug or not?? But whenever i send a video that is clearly below 8MB it still won't let me send it and kept telling me about the max file size. Could you please fix this? Thank you!! Really appreciate it,3
com.discord,Hussain Hamdani,"Great app but with limited mobile usage. I help create and organise channels for many servers and not being able to drag and drop channels to reorganise is a huge pain. This is probably just a software issue, but I use a redmi device and the miui dark mode is VERY buggy. On discord a lot of the white and black get mixed up meaning the indicator for unread messages becomes almost invisible and text shown with 'code style' markup becomes white. Sometimes bot buttons don't respond. Please fix this",3
com.discord,Blueberry Delight,"ruined after the recent update. much slower, takes longer to navigate servers or channels. profile colours refuse to load and the text is ruined. everything is either uselessly cluttered or empty without reason, which makes it uncomfortable and overwhelming to use. if it isn't broken, don't fix it.",1
com.discord,AurianDatenshi,App abruptly went down hill. I'm connected to wifi and it's constantly keeping me in connecting hell. I'm in the chat where a message comes in and the notif doesn't clear until I go in and out. Images no longer load Until like 2h later,1
com.discord,Oni ‚ÄúOnised95‚Äù Sed,I love the app but since changing the layout it has been horribly laggy and watching other peoples streams has be more of a slideshow than a stream. Its incredibly poor right now.,3
com.discord,Nikhita Prabhudesai,"Been using it for 2 years now since Covid and it's an amazing platform to find like minded people, sort discussions into different channels and even manage projects for professional teams. Love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
com.discord,FlameShooting,"Is a good app for chatting and Calling with friends. But there's one small problem. Everytime I call my friends or group call. It crash and make disconnected from call. Can u fix this problem Thank you,",2

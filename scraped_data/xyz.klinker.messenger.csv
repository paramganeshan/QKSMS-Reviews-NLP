xyz.klinker.messenger,Mitchell Sommer,"The only reason I used this app is because of its ability to schedule messages, but it didn't come without a cost. There were multiple instances, in group texts and in texts with individuals, where it would show that a message went through from my end when it actually didn't. I just switched back to my default messaging app, and right when I did that, everyone got a total of around 100 texts that never went through. I have a Galaxy A52, if that provides some context.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,craig sonis,"Been using this for the past year. It's excellent in all aspects except for one thing that I can't seem to find a solution. When sending a photo I often want to save data, so I just want to send a reduced photo size (MB to k). The only want to do this is (I think) is to attach the photo picking from a secondary Photo App on my phone which will attach the reduced photo size. Fix that for 5 stars as I use this all the time.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,badger codes,"pulse is okay. it's a paid version of qksms or textra, but without any additional features to warrant the subscription fee. pulse gets the job done in that it sends and receives messages, but there's no real development or premium features that i have noticed. if one were to set their dns to block ads system-wide, and then go with a free, reputable messaging app, the experience would be identical.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,arnold r,"I've had Pulse SMS (free) for a few years and it served me well. Recently switch phones to a Pixel 6A. I was able to copy over the app (and text messages) w/o a hitch. However, it keeps asking me for the Paid version trial, and can't get past that pop-up screen. I had to switch messaging app because of this.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alison Milne,Been using Pulse for years and was happy with it. Until today. I got a new phone and had problems transferring data. I download the app thinking it's the same old app. These POS's let you download the app then immediately want you signed up for their monthly or yearly plan. No option to stay on the free app. They can FO to the nth degree.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark Young,"Used to be a good app to sync between phone and PC, I can no longer sync with my PC or send messages from there. I've contacted support and followed all directions with no improvement. Going to use Google Messages from now on, it's free and I wasted money on a lifetime subscription to Pulse. I would have given 5 stars if it still worked.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,BC,"Edit: originally gave it a one-star rating. Leaving a one-star rating. Even after getting the subscription issue straightened out. This app will not send an MMS message or picture message. It doesn't matter if I try to send it from my phone over wi-fi, or data, from my Wi-Fi tablet, or through my browser on the computer. It shows the messages are being sent, but the recipient never receives them. If I open a new texting app, it shows all MMS messages were not sent. Inexcusable for a paid app!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrew “Andy” Doll,"This app is great! Saves your message history in case you lose or break your phone. Can text from anywhere, including your PC! Edit: Down two stars. With my S22 Ultra I can no longer send MMS or Pictures to anyone with an iPhone. I have changed APN Settings, Network settings and so much more with no luck. Going to have to find a better app until this gets fixed. No tutorial has worked to fix this issue.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Igor Steel,"Original developer sold the app. Since then, I've been unable to sync, and support hasn't helped at all. They've repeatedly sent me the same (useless) instructions apparently without looking at notes from the last support rep. They've repeatedly delayed responding for weeks at a time, and they have completely failed to help. If I could, I'd ask for my money back. This app no longer works as advertised, and support seems to be helpless. Update: Contacted them again, but no answer...",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,mAtom “Ash” West,"I love the Pulse app and want to give it 5 stars but there are issues that prevent that. Pros: I L♡VE being able to name group threads, set custom tones and the backup. (Paid version.) Cons: Randomly it will send any photos that didn't go through originally all at once and they don't show on my end. My husband (paid account, same service, better phone) randomly can't send gifs, while I can. The ""solutions"" are ridiculous and don't prevent reoccurrances. Unistall/ reinstall, etc... 🤦🏼‍♀️",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christian Valerio,"My phone randomly started sending old photos and text to people I don't even talk to anymore. I received about 20 messages from different people saying that I sent them texts/photos without any context. The worst part is I can't see anything that I sent, I only get their responses. So in reality, more text were sent out, but only a small amount of people responded back. It took some time to realize that these were all old text they re-received. Insane! I will no longer be using this app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Francisco Ochoa,The app was ok but there were persistent issues when sending and receiving messages. The final straw came in September when I got signed out of my devices and could not log back in with the password I've always used. There's no way to reset your password without deleting your current account. I sent a request several times to proceed with the account reset and never got the email to finish the process. Could it be that this company got hacked? Don't waste your time with this app!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,RimWulf,Edit: the one the I have a problem with are app they they don't answer. Granted the removal of the wear OS app seems to be Google's doing but would it be so bad to get an update. I'm considering buying a another lifetime sub but considered the price hike and the lack of correspondence $99 is a bit steep. Does what it's supposed to. Glad they finally made it usable workout setting it as texting app so I can read messages that I received in the other device?s number.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark M.,"Cons: web only had a history going back 11 days, therefore searching past texts was practically useless. Support takes too long to respond. 2 days was the fastest turnaround & so far I'm up to 4 days on current issues. Not all contacts show up on web when I type in their name to send text. Dates not shown when scrolling thru contacts of past texts on web. Dates only show when you're in a specific text. List of conversations are on a separate page from somebody you are texting (contact flipping).",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,JM Braz,"enough with the rate our app even after posting a rating and also the upgrade notification! if I thought upgrading was worthwhile I would have done it long ago. I get messages on multiple devices already for free through another service. this app has no multi-select capability to delete images inside a thread, it has no ability to block a series of numbers (like # contains or # begins with) both have to be done 1 at a time ..a real P.I.T.A!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stuart Gelin,"The UI is excellent and it definitely has some nice features, but I do wish there were some more features like spam blocking, RCS, and the ""iphone react > emoji"" thing. Also, the web app doesn't seem to be maintained. It works sometimes, but it doesn't sync well.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Greenstein,I have had the paid version this app for a few years and it was great until recently. Bugs caused to crash. Reinstalled and lost many saved cherished messages. The value prop of the pro is that it restores old messages. It did not here. Customer service takes days to reply and so far has been of no use. Where are the backups on the server that should fix this? Update: oct 4 - no resolution or help Oct 10 - no resolution or help,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cherie,"Thank goodness for the free trial. I got this specifically for the auto reply feature since it said that I could choose a keyword to send an auto reply. This would be a huge boon for my work, so I'm not bogged down answering the same questions again and again. Only it didn't work at all despite multiple tries, and all my outgoing messages are starting with 0#. Like ""0# Hey can I call you later"" etc. I would've loved the functionality they promised but unfortunately they're not delivering.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Evitaa Evans,"What happened? I've used Pulse for 2 years. I can't access anything anymore. Settings, archived messages. Nothing. ETA. I did fix it. I had to text myself to access everything. Then my correct phone number showed and I was able to see archived messages and access settings. I don't know why a completely different phone number locked it, but it did. Sorry, I can't trust an app that's not dependable. And no, I will not go in and report this bug. You get one chance. You lost it. Bye.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stephen,"Z fold 4: Great app, I've been using it for years. But it would absolutely be nice to have a split view like Google messaging for fold devices (for a non-rotated display). Also *please* show the side scroll position for message windows because it's invisible on my fold 4 and I keep accidentally hitting it, randomly scrolling though the message history.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,PM Mc,Since 29 Aug update it doesn't notify on phone and galaxy watch with new texts. It also constantly crashes on phone. No I didn't change settings or add new apps. This update currently makes it worthless. Don't get until they fix it. Also you can note their reply to all of us is the same canned load of bull. It IS the most recent update and that's the problem!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Violet Heise,"I've been using this as my text app for a long time now. It works really well, and the occasional bugs I get are minor and resolve quickly/easily. I really like the customization. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to get read receipts from other Pixel users.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim Clay,"Used to be a great app, but since getting new phones in February, (S21+'s) have been having random issues with mms messages. We thought it was our carrier, but after troubleshooting for a few hours tonight, I tried the default samsung messages app and things started working. We had a ton of expired messages from ""unknown"" of and a couple that weren't expired. Clicked on them and they were my test images that hadn't gone through on Pulse. Missed a lot of messages the last several months.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Fiona Scales,"I've used this app for years now and been very happy up until the most recent update. Like many others, I'm no longer receiving notifications. I checked settings, tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and even contacted support. They said they are aware of the issue and working on an update. That was 2 days ago. Really getting annoyed at not being able to receive a notification when I get a text! Please fix soon!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,J Mckinnon,"ERRORS Nice outlay, but I've been told before that I've missed texts / replies that weren't sent or received. The app looks and feels nice. However, I won't be using again after switching to my stock messaging app and seeing a ridiculous amount of ""failed to send"" flags next to texts over the past three to five months, that all showed as ""sent"" in pulse. * Yes the app is always updated, I have 5g service, and gigabit internet at home. This is a software issue, not connectivity.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Courteney Schenck,"This was a great app until about a week ago, first messages wouldn't send. Did all the tech things, still didn't work. Developer says they are working through issues. Ended up getting a new phone (not bc of this), messages now send and receive but don't notify. No win here. I hope one day they'll fix it as I've been using it for several years but doesn't seem like much hope right now.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Levana Blankenship,"This app was great up until recently... With the latest update, the ability to change the SIM within the app was removed. The site doesn't even reflect the change. I utilized this application for my business with my dual SIM to avoid having to give out my personal number to clients. It can't even do that anymore so I'll be disputing the charge on my card for the premium version of this app as it no longer does what it advertised.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steven Smith,"NO LONGER FREE TO USE! 😡 Used this app for more than two years but now uninstalling. After the most recent update, I stopped receiving notifications for text messages and didn't know why. I've seen others have the same issues. Recently uninstalled and reinstalled to try and fix the issue and the app is now forcing me to sign up for a payment plan to continue using it. It is no longer free. Thanks but bye!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris Edgar,"Frequent login/credential problems. Every couple months, it locks me out and says my subscription has expired. Log back in, go through captcha a few times, look up how to fix it, and a half hour of frustration later you're good again. Sorry, guys, this is not what I am willing to pay for. This is absolutely unacceptable behavior for a paid subscription app. It's been, what, a year (for me anyway), and you haven't fixed this. Don't ask me to refresh subscription. YOU fix it. Unsubscribed.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,jynn,i love the archive feature of this app. also that when you Blocklist someone there's not a little side folder that holds their messages. also love the scheduling feature. it helps to be able to schedule a message to be sent at a future date (birthdays for instance) that not only keeps you from having to remember but also reminds you once it's sent. great app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A. C.,"Got lifetime service, does what I need seamlessly, and makes message backup over new phone with new number from old phone a breeze. Developer was really quick to respond to email and questions- awesome. Get this- you wont be dissapointed. Edit- nothing has changed my opinion. Its honestly one of the best apps I've used. I've never had any issues with it. Edit Aug 2022- Still flawless, the ONLY app I've never had any issues with, to this day. Absolutely simple but works perfectly",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kathy Kerber Music,Sep 2 update....nope....keeps crashing on my phone which keeps telling me there is a bug in the app. Uninstalled reinstalled same problem. Conversations missing some texts. Honestly it is a buggy mess that keeps loading ads for its subscription service LOL bought it once before. Had nothing but problems. Tried it again last month (free version cuz I have a different google account now) I will never pay for an unreliable texting app. I depend on clear and timely communication. Grade: F,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Elizabeth Roman,It's a great app. I always download this onto all my phones and use it versus the original messaging system it has. It allows you to schedule messages and private message along with normal texting abilities. Updates always cause bugs and now I'm not getting notifications and the app randomly crashes and doesn't reopen.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sean Sturgill,"I used to love this app. Today, I was having issues where it was not sending me notifications of texts. I reinstalled it and my entire contact list started receiving all sorts of random photos! It's awful! I have no idea where the pics are coming from. They aren't my photos. This is terrible. Fix it!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,skippy flatrock,Really good app but since I updated the app it crashes every 10 seconds to where it is nearly impossible to send texts. Ever since the update I am not able to send texts with eas which I have been able to for years. I am using a Razer phone 2. This is the only app that keeps crashing on my phone.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sean Chase,"This app was great until 9/1/22 now it crashes when a new text comes in whether it's open or not so there's no notification, visual or sound, to alert me to a new text. It'll crash while I'm reading a text as well. I've tried clearing the cache, rebooting my phone, reinstalling the app and nothing works, time to find a new messenger app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Roy,"Update: This app has recently become a buggy mess. I don't know what the developer is thinking. A few months ago, I completely lost the ability to send messages with the app. Took them two weeks to fix it and they never answered any of the emails I sent to support. Now it started to randomly turn text to hyper links, which is incredibly annoying. (words like ""I'll"", ""cares"", ""see"" all become links). The dev really needs to *test* updates before they go out.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Porter Lyman,"I'm was a big fan of this app, having a lifetime subscription. However, I found out recently that I have not been receiving a lot of texts. I thought it was a carrier issue, but after switching to another texting app I started getting them normally. PulseSMS has much going for it, but not showing texts that come in is a huge issue. That's the one thing it has to be perfect at, but has failed. Maybe I'll try again in the future. I know the app gets updates, but it'll need a LOT of love.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,F S,"Often a text is not send although it confirm that it was. Cannot send or receive photos, although I should be able to based on my plan and phone set up. Need a new app. UPDATE: I deleted the app and reinstalled it. Works like a charm. I can send photos and videos. Took me two months to find this advise but I did not. If anyone has similar problems with the app. do what I did, reinstall it. Change my rating from 1 star to 5 starts.  Thank you PULSE.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jake Weed,"*Edit* - Pulse has always been great, but sometimes it just decided not to send photos and I can't find a way to fix that issues. I always come back and try it again but this is the second time around it has the same issue.* The BEST sms app there is hands down. I've used over a dozen and this is easily the best one, with the most options and being able to seamlessly text with my tablet and computer is a giant plus.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jayce Miskel,"Edit: Newest update is screwed up on Android 13 with Pixel 6 Pro. Don't get notified. Use my phone for work and can't have that. Hopefully they fix it soon. My initial review: Great app, best messaging app I've ever used. It's simple to use, yet has very many complex features. Love the ability to sync between devices. This is probably the most used app I have.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Arnulfo Nieto,"There's been an ongoing issue, when receiving multiple pictures, the app will show duplicates of one image when there are actually different images. So, if I get two pictures one of a dog and another of a cat, the dog will show up twice. I have to exit the app just to look at the real images. Sometimes when I've updated the app sometimes messes up. I do wish the conversation bubbles could be updated.. maybe something similar to iOS bubbles. The more customization, the better!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,J.D. H.,"It's fine when it works. I have a paid subscription and just about every month, it suddenly goes blank, as if I haven't sent any messages and can't find them even when I log in on the web and can see them. I have to uninstal the app from my tablet and re-instal and wait for it to download all the messages again. It's *very* frustrating. UPDATE 6/18/22 Guys, I did contact you and now it doesn't recognize my password on the tablet, but on the phone, it's fine. SO frustrated.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Eli Cutchen,"It's a pretty decent texting app. It offers a lot of customization like colors and other aesthetics. One reason why I switched from Verizon's Messages+ app, was because it allows you to name your group messages (something you can only do when creating group messages in Messages+). Also, you can customize each group message individually. You can set a ringtone specifically to the group, rather than setting that ringtone to each individual recipient. Overall, pretty happy with it!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Corrine C,"Have been using this app for the last 6 months or so and it was great. However, all of a sudden it stopped notifying me of my messages. I tried to see if it needed updating and it didn't, so I unintstalled and reinstalled but it didn't fix the problem. Upon reinstalling it, it resent some old texts from like months ago for whatever reason. I deleted it because it's pointless to have a texting app that doesn't notify you when someone messages you.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Douglas German,"Overall it's a very good app. With minor fine-tuning, it's pleasing to the eye. The only problem I see so far is it will trash an outbound video attachment with over-compression, but an inbound video is fine, at least with using a .mov file. To override send without delay is cumbersome. All the rest I like. Feedback explained. Upped rating.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Levi,"Overall this app has been great. However, recently (as in the last 2 days maybe just one) I no longer receive ANY notifications when I receive a message. I have gone through my settings in detail, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but to no avail. I don't know if this was a recent issue with the latest Android update or what, but I am considering moving elsewhere unless I can get some sort of update to what this issue is and when it will be fixed.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shiela Lee,"So far I like the app. I'm having trouble with the time stamp being off on most texts. Some by days, some by months 🤷‍♀️ I can't tell if this is something I can correct or a bug. ---> update! Developers suggestion seems to have corrected my problem with the timestamps! Thank you for your help! ---> 6/22 when I reply to group texts, individual messages are sent to everyone the author had sent the text to. Not keeping my reply in the group text thread. Where is the setting to fix that?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cam Storm,"My only issue is I can't customize the color bubble of my friends' and families' texts. Other than that, it's fantastic. Edited to add: I had an issue where my niece got ahold of my mom's phone and sent me a text with hundreds of emojis and it caused the app to stop responding when I tried to open it. I had to delete the texts in the browser app so I could text my mom again.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rich LeValley,"I downloaded this to allow me to use a tablet as my primary text device while I use it for work related tasks. It's great for that. And I like the templates feature a lot. I can see myself using that for work purposes. It is easy to understand and use, feeling the most like the native text app compared to other apps that do the same thing. I love it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ann -,"After the most recent update. The app has been extremely difficult to use. It will minimize while typing text and it dies not save the text in Draft, you have to to it all over again. Also the notifications are sporadic. You need to keep checking to see if you have a text if you are waiting for an answer. The app worked amazing up until this last update. Been dealing with this for about a week now.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gilber Garcia,"This app was great when Luke owned it. I trusted in him selling It that it would be handled well. The second to last update broke notifications while creating a mess of bugs. Random glitches like the keyboard minimizing or closing conversations, even closing the app. The kicker was that the update notes stated it was to correct some bugs. I'll continue to use it as a lifetime sub. But man I can jump ship when next I hear something bad. Better not be skimming messages",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Terence McKinney,"The app is awesome, one of the most user friendly sms apps out there. The best thing about it is being able to use it on your PC or laptop, and is well worth springing for the subscription fee for that upgrade. I had a small bit of trouble when I switched phones, and while I had to fiddle with it on my own to get it to work, the folks at Pulse were very responsive and eager to help. That's worth six stars.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jenise Frangella,Love this app! I recently uninstalled because I want to minimize apps on my phone. My phone's default messaging app just couldn't cut it and I quickly reinstalled this one! The customization options are great and I love getting a notification with a name and no content. I also have it set to easily delete or archive messages. Love this app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,ssr66902,"Message restoration beyond a certain point in time results in images not being restored (an empty placeholder being left where the images should be). Also, photos are no longer being delivered to my iPhone contacts. I've isolated the problem to Pulse as Google Messages, Google Voice, and Signal, when configured to handle SMS and MMS, all send photos without issue. (S20 Plus 5G, Android 11). This app kept me with Android, but since the new ownership has gone downhill. Next phone? iPhone!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jade Rayne de la Cruz,"I abdutely live this messaging app! I've tried 4-5 and this is the only one I've found that allows me to create folders to organize my texts! I love this function! It makes finding the right text thread much, much easier! I've grouped my messages under ""Family,"" ""Work,"" ""Friends,"" and a folder for my son with all his friends and their parents. Plus, no ads!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe,"used to be my favorite messaging app, but its unreliable and the bugs are too severe. it just caused my phone to automatically resend dozens of picture messages to people I havent spoken to in months. This happened after uninstalling, because the notifications stopped making sounds and vibrating despite being turned on in the app and phone settings. Really unacceptable errors.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jose Martinez,"This is one of the best, low cost, phone to computer texting apps I've ever used. It's simple yet very efficient. The only thing I wish it had was a notification that you were receiving a phone call and maybe it would show the number calling on a secondary device. Otherwise it's a wonderful simple app for both computer and phone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Brienza,"I have been using this app for a couple years. And loved it. The last few months however, I have an issue where I will send a picture and the recipient never receives it. I tried resending the picture while on WiFi and while cellular. Still nothing. The recipients are both Android and Apple.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A lot of features to like, but still a few bugs to work out. When composing a text, if you get interrupted by a phone call, email, or other notification, the content of the draft disappears...which is highly annoying. With the stock messages program on Android, the drafts automatically get saved (and indefinitely), but not on Pulse. I often start writing a text and come back to it later to finish, and if the app doesn't save drafts, it may not work for me.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app! The speed with which it syncs is amazing. I can have my phone with Pulse open right next to the tablet I'm working on and a text will come in and shows on both almost simultaneously. I answer from my tablet and hit send. My response goes up into the history area of the app on the tablet at the same time it pops up into the history portion of the app on my phone! This had been a concern of mine before purchasing the app outright. Other apps that sync have considerable lag and that would not work with a texting app. Lag could add great confusion as to which part of the text I was responding to on the part of whom I'm texting. Pulse has somehow made this a non-issue. Also, I forgot my backpack with my phone and tablet in it, but still got texts at work through the web. Just awesome. Thanks Pulse. I knew for a long time this should be possible, but you guys are the first ones I found that make it work flawlessly. I wish I could give 10 stars.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tia Ross,"It's better than the native messaging apps on my Android, that's for sure. However, it crashes whenever I try to send a pic via text from the gallery and it opens up multiple instances of this app. I have to go find and close them all before I can get back in. I like the app a lot though. Will keep using. Hopefully, an update will fix that minor issue. Oh, and it's not searchable like the native apps.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent app. Seems to work beautifully across all platforms. So far, extremely pleased. I have been experiencing problems with texts showing as sent... Only shows ""sending..."" without a confirmation stamp. This may be due to my inexperience with the app or something I am doing wrong. I do not know, but I cannot fault the app unless I know what is causing the problem. It may be the T-mobile network, it may be my Comcast wireless. I don't have the expertise or knowledge to know what is causing this. I appear to have good signals from both services. I have not given 5 stars because of my current difficulty and because I am unsure of future RCS compatibility (???). Again, I'm not savvy enough to even know if this is important. Otherwise, this app offers everything I have been looking for. Love the customization options and private conversations feature.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Average from the phone aspect. It didn't show the previous messages I had on the default messaging app. Although it did properly send messages, I would have given a higher rating if it showed the previous messages on Pulse. I wasn't able to delay messages but probably because I didn't know how to. Edit: I found the delaying feature. It's in advanced features. If anyone knows if the app shows previous messages, please let me know.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse Venson,"And yes.. it has the kitchen sink. This is the only SMS alternative I have found that has all the extras I was look for in one app. It actually has a couple things I didn't see a need for, but after trying, I can never go back to another SMS. The subscription price is so low you would think it is bait and switch or the app it not up to par.. And you would be wrong. The only problem I would see for some people would be the lack of customizable layout and themes. Great app!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse has become very unreliable over the last year. The app works fine on my Pixel 3, but so does the stock Android app. Trying to send and receive messages from other devices, such as my Mac or through a browser, is very unreliable. Sending messages fails 50% of the time, even though it shows the message as sent. Receiving messages fails less often, but often enough for me to lose trust in Pulse. I am looking for an alternative. The developer has been unresponsive.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Esteban Padilla,"MUCH better than the built in text function. I even paid for the lifetime version because I use the computer text function a lot. There are a few issues, though. 1) Has the tendency to resend EVERY text and photo I've sent over the past few years every now and then after a restart. This is mildly annoying at best and embarrassing at worst. 2) Doesn't really work well with smart watches and other smart devices. I tried it with a galaxy watch awhile back and was disappointed that it didn't work.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall it's a great app. It does the text, MMS, group MMS function perfectly well. Basic function for free makes it an outstanding alternative to Google messages. The one problem I have is that attaching multiple JPEG files to a MMS is too hard. I can do it sometimes, and that's too hard, and other times it won't attach multiple files at all. I may have to go back to Google just for that because of how I use text. The option to upgrade to end-to-end encrypted messages is a wonderful option but I may have to skip it.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's my favorite texting app, but there's a bug that's been driving me crazy. Pulse will never change the name of a contact, even if you change that contact's name in your phone's contact list. To change somebody's name I had to completely delete and reinstall pulse, and delete my entire message archive from the cloud. Edit: the developer responded and showed me a very simple way to fix this issue! Thanks!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This was a seemingly good alternative to the 'standard' text app but it got slower and slower until it literally appeared to grind to a halt. I have no idea whether it was because there were a lot of content in my primary threads, or perhaps because I seem to receive a lot of images in text. Whatever it was, it became totally unusable. Pity, I liked the layout and flexibility. I tried this again and LOST ALL of my text history when I got stuck in the GooApple loop of FORCING you to set a txt app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A great messaging app. A clean, simple, uncomplicated design that just works. And, it's free if you don't need syncing between devices. And, if you do need syncing, 10 dollars for life is super cheap. A lot of the complaints are tech problems that have nothing to do with the app. I almost never review anything, but felt compelled to review this app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Been using for a few months now. The concept is fantastic, but the refresh rate can be frustrating at times from the computer side (despite my gigabit connection and 2018 Macbook Pro). Roughly half the time I receive a message on my phone, Pulse wont pick it up for an hour or so. If that's fixed, it'd be my most frequently used app/desktop app. Great features on desktop - reverse order of texts, enter to send, etc., but lacking execution at this point in time.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It is good, but I wish it didn't automatically assign each conversation a color. I thought that assigning the theme color to all convos would reset it, but it didn't. Also I wish it would show the picture of the people you are chatting with next to the speech bubbles. That's especially important with group texts. I like the privacy options, though. All in all it is alright. Not yet perfect.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Pirho-omega,"The web version on chrome doesn't lose the '(1)' notification in the tab even after I've clicked and read the message. That's not a deal breaker though. Love the delay I can give texts just in case I messed up the wording it something. However... Scheduled messages didn't send correctly. I scheduled them to send each one minute following the other (900, 901, 902, etc.), but the first three sent all at once. Weird, but it's not a feature I plan on using. It's not a deal breaker.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall great app that syncs with desktop. 2 issues... 1. After sesrching for a person on mobile and then sending a text to that person, your position in main list goes to when you last sent that person a text. So you have to scroll all the way back to the top. 2. When starting a new text on desktop, it doesn't show the history of texts. So you can't see the last texts in case context is needed. Otherwise it's a great app with many useful features, such as pinning texts at the top.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love the fact I can see different ""themes"" for each person...tone and colors are super customizable for each person you text. I have a glitch here and there where it freezes so I have to exit app and then go back. Also I have to figure out how to change the keyboard apart of it because it's like default and it gives me autocorrect which I don't want. That's the reason behind my 4..maybe 4.3 stars because even though it's a darn good app, it's not 100% perfect.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,kara miranda,I love Pulse. I uninstalled it at one point trying to search for another app. But came back to this one. Then I bought the lifetime account. Afterward I discovered it doesn't sync with my laptop very well. I've tried to fix the settings over and over again an uninstall and reinstall in addition to refreshing. This does not fix the syncing problem and the ability to text all of my contacts.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse Kropf,"This SMS app is nearly perfect. The ability to pin conversations to the top of the screen is very helpful. I wish I could have both emojis and the Enter key on my keyboard at the same time. And I really like that I can mark a message as unread, but I wish it would give me a new notification when I do that. The other feature I miss has to do with deleting messages. Pulse can automatically delete messages older than a certain time. But I would rather delete them per convo when they're over 200.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app. Lots of quality of life features that are super convenient. Only three tiny issues which prevent it from being 5-star: 1. I wish the pop-up notification could display more of the incoming text, instead of just a couple lines. 2. There's a bug on both of my phones (both motorola) which causes the theme to change to white until I click on it, then it fixes itself. 3. I wish there was a semi-transparent widget theme, instead of just a solid color. Overall, these are very minor issues.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,App works sporadically. When working it's a joy to use. When it's not working it's a royal pain in the a$$. I've needed to delete and reinstall twice in the last week just trying to get it to send simple text messages. I may start looking else where. 10/23/2018 UPDATE...After some adjustments to the settings on my phone this app has begun to perform as I had hoped.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ron Spi,"Absolutely superior to the Message+ by Verizon. The app syncs immediately, allows for more personalized features and blocks unwanted text, and this is the reason I paid for the app. New features are added all the time and the developer is too busy updating the users regarding fixes. In the desktop version, attaching an image is a hit or miss. Double click on the image sometimes adds it to the message. Dec. 8, 2020 : the app now is free for all, and improved since my initial review. 4 stars.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"After having done the free trial for this one, switched over to Mood and stuck with Mood for months, and then coming back to the paid version, I can confidently say that this is the better of the two and, since they seem to be the top competitors right now, probably the best option in the store. It's streamlined, cute, and has a wide array of useful features (a web app that actually sends SMS messages and an option to delay sending for a quick proofread are standouts). Very much worth the price.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"10/2020 - I have been using this for over 2 years now. When I get a new phone, I have at times tried other texting apps, but I always return to this one. It runs the way it is supposed to, and has proven itself very reliable and very flexible over the years. I highly recommend it. 3/2019 -Wokrs the way it should, with a rich set of configuration options. Works very well on my phone, tablet, and PC, quickly syncing between the three. I have used other Sam's apps... I'm sticking with this one.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love the app and that I can text from my computer. All the customization options are really great. Group texting is a breeze. Sharing pictures/screenshots/whateva takes just a few clicks. My single gripe is that sometimes when I get a notification from this app it takes me all the way to the top of whatever page I'm looking at. Usually not a big deal. But sometimes I'm like hella deep in an article and I'll have to find my way back. So yeah like 97% perfection. Try it out!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brenda Thompkins (Butterflydzines),"EDIT: Too many messages are not making it to me, photos sent to me aren't arriving either. It's not reliable anymore.I've been using Pulse for a long time and I love it. It's completely customizable and I especially like the option to blacklist unwanted texts; I was unable to that with my phone's default messaging app. The Private Conversation option is very handy as well. The app has always been reliable and I highly recommend.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really great app. 2 stars because randomly the contact pictures don't show. And the blacklist feature is kind of useless. You have to type in the number you want blacklisted. You should be able to just press and hold the number or numbers and select blacklist. Much better than the current method. Edit: I know you can open a conversation and select blacklist. But when it's a spam text including 20 numbers that doesn't work. I would like to be able to click a number in the list and blacklist it.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have been using the app for a few months now and LOVE IT!!! The options like pinning conversations to the top, categories and colors all make it so much easier to use and sort than other similar apps. But most of all, the ability to text from any device is great. I love it all and don't have anything bad to say at this point. I will update if that time comes... but I don't think it will. VERY WORTH THE COST OF A COUPLE OF CUPS OF COFFEE!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Isaac Cady,"I use it mostly because it has an AMOLED theme and I can choose the colors for conversations. Some other features such as delayed sending are nice. The ability to (pay extra to) access your text messages from any device is practically useless if you always have your phone with you—and who nowadays doesn't always have their phone on them? Not only that, but you have to use a web browser to access a webpage with a slow interface in order to do so.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Better than Google Messages except.for one feature. It doesn't have the ability to create audio messages. It works well with all features it does have though, which is more than I can say for Google. Unlike Google, the desktop client on my Macbook Pro works flawlessly. Every time. No glitches. No waiting for messages to connect and sync, even. Best texting app I've found so far. Would give it 5 stars if it offered audio messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have tried many of the SMS apps. Pulse is the best. Good performance. Very nice appearance out of the box, with simple, useful adjustments as needed to customize with your preferences.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I loved the app until the last couple updates. Now the conversation doesn't move up when I bring up the keyboard. I then have to back out to the conversation list and open the contract again, and then bring up the keyboard before I can see what I'm typing. I sent a bug report but just got a stock reply. I kept it for 3 weeks, but it's just too irritating on a daily basis to keep using it. I cancelled my subscription, and am looking for another app. This occurs on both the beta and stable release",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,So far I love it! One of the very few apps that works completely with my HTC U11 Unlocked (Verizon). It's so clean and I love being able to customize each conversation. Haven't tried it on another device yet but I look forward to doing that. The only thing I'm having trouble with is finding the quick settings. I want to be able go turn on and off driving mode without having to go into advanced features.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Clean, minimalist, highly functional design. Unfortunately, several key aspects keep it from becoming my new text replacement. 1. Hidden message list is out in the open. Since I sometimes pass my phone to others for business, I prefer knowing my private messages are fully hidden. 2. Autoresponder is not in the main list and must be accessed through settings. 3. Autoresponder is limited to a single one per contract, which can only be deleted and not deactivated for later reuse. If you don't need any of these specialized functions, however, this app stands as a solid choice.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Evan Mobley (amminadabz),"Loaded with all the right features and a clean modern aesthetic. Switched from Textra and I don't regret it. The online and cross platform sync is the big draw, and you can get it for a one time fee or a cheap subscription. I really hate subscribing to software, so you can guess which I chose. I recommend color-coding all the people in your group chats, but this has caused a bug in the windows app where it makes people the wrong colors.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I had grown frustrated with the Android messaging app as it constantly crashed and nailed to send messages. This app is crisper, easier to use, and allows for better messaging. if you want to use it on multiple platforms which is a huge benefit. Be prepared to pay a small premium for use on multiple platforms. I especially like how I can color code and truly customize each conversation. It's just a far superior app than what Google has put out.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Starlitzer X,"I do like the app... However, it won't send videos. I even try to send the videos straight from my gallery and it doesn't work. I've tried every way possible to send videos and nothing works. I know it's the app. I've had this app on 2 different phones, with the same problem. It shows that I sent the video, but it never shows up on the recipients phone. Once that is changed I will give 5 stars! (Android)",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is pretty much a great app. I like the fact that I can receive my texts on my tablet, and they tend to sync perfectly between my tablet and my phone. The only thing that needs some work done is sending messages. I receive them just fine on both my phone and tablet, but it can take a while sometimes to send a message. It will say ""sending"" for a good 5 minutes or so sometimes, and every once in a while, it won't send it at all but it will say that it was sent.",4

Other stock messaging apps always seem to fall short. This app is stable and easy to use. I rarely rate my apps but I felt this one deserved it. This one works great. If I had to critique it in any way I would like to see the time on my texts. I'm probably doing something wrong but sometimes I see the time of the text, sometimes I don't. But it's great overall.",5

Thank you for doing what no one else could seem to accomplish! p.s. I did disable the battery optimization.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I would have liked this app a lot except for two problems right off the bat. First off, to back up your messages, you have to pay a subscription fee. Secondly, the messaging part is almost perfect except you cannot add anyone to an ongoing group conversion. This is something I can do with my phone's own built in message app and often used. I'm uninstalling it for those two reasons. If those don't matter to you, it's a great app.",3

I really hope that these issues can get resolved soon!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sky Malone-Quigley,"Highly recommend it! I got this app to be able to customize each conversations ring tone that the new phone updates took away (which doesn't help if you need to separate business and personal texts).

Thankfully I discovered the Pulse app that not only allows me to assign custom text notification sounds, but also offers several more useful features.",5

You won't believe how much being able to pick your own colors for the contacts instead of picking muted pre-picked color swatches is a deal-maker or deal-breaker. That said, I keep trying to use this app. However, it's lack of support for keeping message up to date with the stock sms or having a sync option is a minor almost major deal-breaker.

When I changed phones, I was able to retrieve my old messages, which was really cool. They still have to work on showing the sent messages. They only show the messages received. One really cool thing about it is that you can schedule a text, this comes in handy on days I'm super busy.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,D,"This is the best messaging app I have ever tried. They usually suck or do nothing new. But this one is different with a beautiful interface, and equiped with great features like message scheduling, private conversations, and a unread message folder for easy access. Try it! You won't be disappointed! I don't think I will download another app again.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've used this app since I got my phone 3 years ago. Absolutely love it, I've never had any issues. Love all the extra features even on the free version. The only thing it's missing is the ability to change contact wallpapers. I use whatsapp when I'm in a no service area and really like that feature. Overall the only two features that would make this have everything you could possibly need. It's wallpaper and the ability to use it via wifi when in no service areas, if that's possible.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,mike rhoades,"I love this app. I have the paid version. It's nice to never worry about losing my texts if I have to replace my phone. Also super handy to be able to log in from any device. I've had the app for years now and honestly it's indespesible to me at this point. All my contacts are color coded, I use the folder organizing feature, it's amazing. And, to top it all off, the UI is beautiful and very easy to use. Best texting app out there.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,JoJoSinger,"Great app with great features such as scheduled text messaging. This is an amazing feature that allows you to text a contact and schedule when you want it sent. However, since the last update, group conversation names keep changing to default ones from contacts and I'm unable to show the contact's picture. I've used this app for almost two years and , with exception of the two issues, have experienced no other problems.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brooke Pestano,"Best texting app! All the features you wanted and didn't realize you needed. After trying just about every Android sms app out there, I finally found exactly what I needed! All your messages backed up (w/a minimal update fee), appearance is totally customizable, open to suggestions, great one on one support! The first one that after a year still hasn't had a bug. I will not look any further!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app! I enjoy the way the messages sort out by date and each messaging chat can be a different color. I appreciate marking messages as unread to come back to them later, and I'm glad I can schedule messages in advance. Just about the only thing I can't do is send or receive ""remarks"" on messages (👍🏼 a message, ❤️ a message, ❓ a message, etc.), but most Android texting apps can't do that (I've only ever found one app that can). So this app works very well, and I'm certainly enjoying it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bethany Miller,"Bright colored visibility is good, and it is nice to access from other devices. The message window that is being typed in stays low on my screen, and if more than a few words are used i can not continue to see what I am typing. It will not scroll up to make a larger type-in box. Is that caused by my phone or by Pulse? I have had a couple picture messages not come through after a sender claimed to have tried several times to resend. May have been error on their end.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe B,"Syncs well across devices. I've been using Verizon Messages+, but it doesn't sync reliably, so I have to manually delete. Pulse gets this right. I'd like to see more conversation options. Colors are assigned in group messages, but sometimes the same color to more than one participant. The sender's name isn't always underneath each message, so unique colors would be helpful. I paid for the permanent version, which I seldom do with apps; that was hasty, but I want the cross platform functionalit.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Like it way more than any other messaging app I've tried so far and the list goes beyond 10. I would like one crucial setting added to the swipe actions, specifically call. Was surprised it wasn't already a feature. It was probably my most used on others. I wouldn't mind being able to change the background of the texts screen to any picture you have downloaded and be able to change the opacity of it. Some the others I tried you could do this but didn't like their overall functionality like pulse",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Amy Charpie,No one can get photos I send and the file limit to send videos seems non existent. I have to resort to using Facebook to message so I'll have to get a new sms app soon! UPDATE: I've contacted customer service and I did literally everything they said. Tried for months. Most people can not receive any picture messages from me at all. There's nothing more that can be done except to finally go back to my default message +Verizon app. I never had any trouble with it.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"What I like about the app is that it is able to monitor SMS text messages on a non-phone tablet. Unfortunately, probably because tablets aren't supposed to send SMS messages, I can't send. Unfortunately, I'm not able to rate the app to it's fullest. I've given it an ""ok"" rating because it does more than what most expected it would do, and has given me at least the ability to receive two-factor texts to my tablet without having to have my cell phone handy.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aline Knoles,"For the most part it does what I need it to do for group texting. My only issue, and I find it very frustrating, is when I'm in the middle of typing a text and I tilt my arm just enough that it rotates my screen, everything I just typed disappears. Then I have to retype everything all over again. I shouldn't have to turn off screen rotation on my phone just for an app to not wipe my text in progress away. If this problem was fixed, it'd be great! I'd love to know if there is a fix.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,argon B,"it would be perfect if it weren't for a few annoying bugs dragging it down. for starters, i can't send gifs. the person receiving it will only get the first frame. secondly, i can't send text and a picture in the same message. if i do that, only the text sends, and the receiver never gets the picture, or even an indication there was a picture. finally, messages sometimes will still say ""sending"" even after they've been sent. if these were fixed, this app would be practically perfect.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's so annoying whenever I receive a large body of text that not only is broken up instead of sending as one message, all of the messages are out of order and I have to play the guessing game as to which message comes next. I even changed the settings in the app, which still didn't fix it. Uninstalling. **EDIT: The developer says any third party app would display text messages that way, which is a lie. I've had other apps display them correctly. Just say that your app can't do that. 😒",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cassio Miranda,"Update on 3.19.22: After updating my phone and begin using swipe to return to the previous page, I don't like the app as much. The left swipe brings a list of menus. I think this should be moved to the top or bottom on the next update. By the way, I think it is time for an update. *********** Fantastic app. I have the paid version. Very clean interface with tons of features including blocking spam.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jobelly Welly,"It's a good app. It has a lot of useful features. I would've loved to make it my default messaging app except it seemed like it didn't store all my previous conversations upon installing it, because I couldn't search for messages that were over 10 days old. Also it would have been nice to be able to make the chat boxes smaller while keeping the font size the same, or at least being able to minimize the space between messages. I think that gives it a cleaner look. Had to uninstall but good app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Barb Seeling,I replaced the sms app that came with my phone with Pulse mainly because the original app didn't support a repeat notification. I like to set sms to repeat the notification sound every 5 minutes to be sure I don't miss a message. Pulse allows me to do that and choose downloaded notification sounds. It allows many features that I find pretty easy to use. I'm not tech savvy but I do like options and Pulse has worked well for me. I've had no issues at all!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent with the premium version for being able to access and use messaging also on my computer. I have often wanted to move attached images to my computer, and this makes it easy. The only issue I ran into was that it failed to import all messages from my previous default messaging app. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it, this time successfully. It includes a long list of features that I like, including soldering and archiving. The developers are very responsive.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Maybe there's a setting I'm missing, but when receiving MMS I don't get any sort of notification that says ""picture message"" or even a pop-up and sometimes it even brings up an old notification from a different conversation. Notifications are sometimes inconsistent and rather than a pop-up, i just see the status bar indicator. Otherwise this app is fantastic!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I thought this would be a great replacement for Google's Messages (after they screwed it up with updates), but I can't figure out how to add a subject. I have to have this to send to iPhones, as they will chop a message into 10 parts without it. Ok.. I'll take your word for it as to the MMS, but I forward pics and texts all the time. I don't see a ""forward"" arrow pop up when I select a text. I only see ""share"" which means I have to select Pulse from a list of apps, then select the recipient...",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Amazing customization options, excellent control over the conversation view. Loses one star though due to a bug related to swiping away messages to delete or archive, where the action doesn't always get committed. Made developer aware of the issue but he did not seem interested in fixing it immediately. But to me, it's a high priority issue.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Curie,I've been using it for about a week. I really like the swipe to delete option and can't understand why Google give that option with their text messenger. The one thing I do miss is the ability to Auto copy when sites send you a text I need that a lot for logging into certain websites as a backup security. Google's text messaging ask you do you want to copy the text then you just paste it in instead of going back and forth. Would really like to see that option.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Pecora,I am really enjoying using this app. It works well and has great pro features. I find it useful for my business. I do photography and I can easily respond to my clients text messages from my computer. This is super handy when I have a lot of photo editing work to do and don't want to take time away to check my phone. I also make good use of the search within conversation when I need to recall details shared with my by my clients.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've always used apps from Klinker, all the way back to the sliding sms days. I even used to be a beta tester for many of them, it's just rather pointless for me to be one now. Smooth, fast, and beautiful. I just wish it had the ability to change the background to a custom picture, although I suppose that's a rather childish feature lol.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great texting app. Only thing I couldn't figure out how to do if it can do it, is skip the delayed send so that if you're OK with the text, you have the option to send it right away. Other than that, I like this SMS app as my daily driver. Also I don't see where you can search a specific conversation instead of searching all your messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jochebed Garcia,My current favorite SMS app. I have been swapping through SMS apps and this is number 3. It's easy to use and the UI is easy enough to navigate. Very customizable if you are into that stuff I like customization but there is more than I need here. I like are when I receive links to news articles or youtube videos there is a little preview which I find awesome. There is an option to pay for SMS access via computer/tablets. I haven't tried it but a nice added feature.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Diane Roberts,"I've been using this app for almost 2 years now. Occasionally I've tried other messaging apps, but this one still has features I like that other apps don't have. Lately I've been having a lot issues with sending pics and gifs (MMS messages with only text are sending like normal) to other Android phones as well as iPhones. I've tried clearing the app's cache, cleared the app's data and reset the app, deleted the cache from each and every app on my phone, and the phone's cache. Nothing has helped!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse is definitely my favorite sms app on the play store. I have used 4 different sms apps (including pulse) and i always found myself coming back to pulse. The interface is great. The customization is nice and not too involved. The ability to send texts from other devices is the best feature in my opinion. Overall, I am more than satisfied with this app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far this is the best messenger app I've found. I do have a few small complaints, though. Feature wise, it's missing a search function. Two bugs I've discovered are that it doesn't update contact names in group chats when you add contacts to your phone, and sometimes it will continue to say a message is sending even after the recipient has received it and responded. The color feature can get somewhat difficult because it makes you assign colors to a chat instead of contacts. This means that in group chats, the contacts can not be assigned specific colors and do not match to their individual conversations colors. Still, with Google's messenger removing any ability to choose colors, this is likely the best messenger app on the market.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Wayne Shelton Sr.,"Love the ability to text from a browser when I'm unable to have my phone which is most of the time. Love that you can color code your contacts ina group chat but they never keep their color, the colors always changing and that's frustrating. Now during the holidays, I am not receiving group photos. Not sure why, but feeling left out when family is commenting on a photo and I'm in the blind. Oh by the way, I paid for the lifetime subscription, because I thought it was the best option available.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Wanted a message app that worked well on a PC desktop. It does. With my Chomebook, I install the app and it works too, of course. I like the quick key to be able to toggle on and off the ""drive mode"", the ability to create folders and assign certain contacts to ""private conversations"" requiring the password (or fingerprint) to access. Simple and clean interface with enough customization options for my taste. Two things I really like: the web/pc interface works really well and the quick key is customizable to allow you to write anything like an ""out of office"" message letting people who text you know you're not available to text back. Great app. Thank you.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I'm really liking this. I can use SMS across all my devices with my main phone number and it works great. It is much more reliable than Hangouts and also looks nicer with more customization. Hangouts is free, but I was missing some notificatons, so I dumped it. Pulse does cost $6 per year ($11 for a lifetime license) to use across multiple platforms, but at least it works reliably. I'm sold! It'd free if used only on your phone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cameron Gilbert,"Been using this app for a while and mostly love it. I picked it for its web/PC ability which works well most of the time and makes it so convenient to text. I'd give 4.5 if I could, only because the web service does have frequent hiccups where it doesn't sync in real time, and because the contact update has always been an issue, with some numbers still showing the phone numbers instead of the contact name. But overall very happy with it!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The app works great in my Android, but seriously fails on BOTH of my Windows 10 machines. Have been in contact with support multiple times, regarding issues where the windows app freezes, and support has not found any solution, and then proceeded to ignore me. It's a shame, because I paid full price for two licenses for the app... one for me and one for my husband. The whole reason I bought it was specifically for cross platform communication.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryan Pocock,I love the app. I love being able to schedule texts. I love being able to get my texts on all my devices including tablet and desktop. Problem is that MMS stopped sending out. So group texts or media (photos) won't send. This appears to be related to the Sprint Tmobile merger. But it is also an app issue. My other messaging apps work (most of the time). Pulse does not. So I have to switch back and forth. Pulse support simply pointed to FAQs and said too busy to help. Not OK for PAID app.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rick Saletta,"I like some of the features they included in the pulse app. Unfortunately, the app is completely unreliable. I send messages from my phone and they don't reach friends and family. The desktop interface is convenient but if you respond to a message on the phone, the response is not visible in the browser version so again, you don't receive all the messages which makes it completely useless. Very disappointing. NO, I do not have time to quality test your app. Do it yourself.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dustin G.,"Overall, it's not bad. The issues I had were the persistent offers to use the paid desktop service, the apparent lack of an ability to lock individual messages (which is handy when you want to delete the contents of a conversation but leave a message to hold the conversation ready), the scheduled message system is clunky, and that my pictures stopped sending at one point and didn't resolve. Maybe those aren't issues for you. In the end, I decided to return to my previous app of choice.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love that I can transfer my conversations to a new phone when needed. I paid for the upgraded version to so and it's great. The flexibility is outstanding though and I'm still learning what it can do a couple of years later. When you swipe a conversation, it archives it so that if you accidentally swiped one you didn't mean to, you can recover it. Of course, if you want to permanently erase it, you can do that from the archived screen. All in all, I thoroughly enjoy it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Xu,Can you add the capability of blocking the sender from a group message. Recently have many spam messages like that and there's no easy way to block them from within Pulse. The popup window turns out to be a feature for Samsung phone. It just somehow no longer works with pulse as it used to. The developer returned my email really quick. Highly appreciated.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrew Edmiston,Love being able to text from my computer! Mac App has a few hiccups but may be because I'm on an older OS. I like the option to view unread messages by themselves. It would be nice to have the option to still show the notification badge icons even after swiping the unread messages from the notification center. Not sure if that's possible on Samsung or not.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank Bertucci,Works consistently well across all my devices which is really what I was aiming for. There are some limitations in file size but otherwise no issues and it's super fast. UI looks great and is easy to use. Hope they can keep developing new features as time goes on. For example linking to the call app for calling from a message would be great!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Lakko,"The messings is awesome, good customization options. Wish I could add a background to a conversation though. Love that you can sync with other devices. The syncing is not perfect, especially wish there was a dedicated iPad app on the app store, but I will get around to installing the workaround iPhone app. Also the Wear OS app doesn't seem to use Bluetooth paired with my phone, it seems to need WiFi.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bruce R,"Easy to use. Free of bugs. Works well with all of the many included features! When my phone recently died, all of my messages which had been saved in the cloud automatically transferred to my new phone when I installed the app and signed in to my Pulse account. Keeps getting better with each update! I moved to a new phone and new Android 10 operating system. The app works well and having the app made the transition very easy.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robrit Johnson,"I enjoy it for basics, like texting. Pictures, GIFs, and any media are a total crapshoot and tend not to work, even on a solid connection. Additionally, I use my car Bluetooth feature when driving so I don't endanger others, and this app does not appear to work with it. My phone's messaging app would receive messages and notify me, and then read them aloud, this app supposedly has a Driving Mode, but it does not notify me or work with my Read Aloud feature. Overall, not bad. But not great.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Toomey,"I've literally tried dozens of texting apps. This is the best, period. Mute a conversation, instead of a specific contact, block by phrase filters to limit spam texts, individual contact notification options, sync across devices, and lots more. I've been using the paid version for 2.5 years now. It's consistent and reliable. I don't understand the recent bad reviews, I've had no such glitches. I love this app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Pam Kilmer,So far I love it! I have been searching for a long time to have a messaging app that connects with my phone and tablet. Finally found one and the price was great. 🙂 I still love the app except when someone sends me a video it is horrible . Anyone know why this is? I might have to get rid of it and find another app that works for videos . ☹ My 2nd review: Have been using it since May of last year. Have been having one issue but Pulse is working with me to get it figured out. 🙂 Great app. 👍,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I find this app very useful. I have several communication devices and this app gives me the ability to see my sms messages across several devices. Allowing me the opportunity to be more efficient and organized with my responses. Only minor issues I encountered so far is that, when I respond to sms via phone, Pulse displays both numbers in text. Also somethings it doesn't mirror texts across all the devices. Even so, I would recommend it as a useful tool especially for the busy people.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Lean & Mean. Just dropped android messages, which is bloated at 90MB. Pulse on the other hand isn't and it's fast too. So far, so good. Yeah android is missing stuff. Pulse can send a quick message from notification drop down. Or hold the widget for a couple of seconds, and the option to send appears. Very helpful for work when things are hectic. We'll see. 111019, Sunday, 0556: great, great app. for work I need to attach photos (less than 300kb) fast, which pulse permits me to do.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a great messaging app full of all kinds of features I didn't even know I was missing. Very user friendly, customizable and unique.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim P,"It's great to be able to text with all my devices, including my desktop. I'd give it 5 stars but my pulse crashes every day or 2 on Samsung Galaxy pad and I have to reopen it. Also, for some reason when I try to attach a file I'm not given the ability to attach a real 'file', only pictures, emojis, etc. Not terrible but a small pain. Overall, great app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Amazing SMS app. I initially downloaded it because the default Samsung app was terribly slow. Pulse is superior to any other SMS app I've used over the years due to it's customizability. You can schedule texts, delay texts, group message, and mute conversations. My only criticism so far is the calling feature. Sometimes when I want to call the person I'm texting, it will call a different person in my contacts, not the person I intended to call. I highly recommend this app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jason Bull,"This has been my text app of choice for a few years, and I've since paid for the full version. I first downloaded it after looking for an app capable of scheduling messages to be sent on specific days and times. Other features have since appealed to me above other apps such as customizable conversation tools, the option to mark messages as ""unread"", pin favorite conversations, view unread messages only, and more. I also no longer have to use a separate app to back up my messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pros: Great app, fun, and useful. Lots of customisation. Cons: Would REALLY like to get rid of ""Today"" ""This Week"", etc... so all messages are together and not separated. It can be a bit buggy at times. I've had issues with conversations staying in 'Private Conversation' folder and randomly moving themselves back to regular convo folder. I tired deleting my account to make sure convos would delete off server and when I restored with same email/pass my past sms could be restored. May not have waited long enough though, not sure. Sometimes when desktop app starts on startup the window is blank white screen. Have to restart app. Other thoughts: Top left box is empty (name/phone number) would like to put an avatar or something. Overall: This is prob the best sms application for android/Windows users! I previously bring up some issues but in reality the issues haven't been too terrible to deal with. Also, Luke seems to update the app quite frequently and fixes things along the way as well as adding new features. This application is truly the way to go!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I downloaded the app because the built in text messaging in my phone was just bland. This app allows you to customize colors giving it a warmer feeling when you open it. Plus, I find it to be easier to use. I rarely have problems with this app, and Ive have had it for over a year. The only issue I have ever had with it was sending messages, but that is more than likely my service than this app. Last but not least, it does not have ads attached to it! I would definitely recommend it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app gives you the functionality the OEM apps don't, the ability to change font and size, color, etc. I could not even read my text messages on my new phone because of the color scheme and I couldn't change it. If you want a text messaging app that puts you in control, with plenty of features, yet simple to use, Pulse is the way to go.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Derrick,"STAY AWAY! It was great, until it wasn't. I spent $65 on the lifetime subscription of the Text/SMS app. I loved the ability to text people from my computer, tablet, and phone seamlessly. Then it wasn't great. People started to not recieve text/multimedia text. Then I didn't receive their text. Then now it's just a luck of the draw if I can communicate with my friends, family, and coworkers. I regret spending so much money on this app and wish I could have a refund.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Simple, affordable, support this dev! I wish it was a tiny bit more customizable and the fluidity leaves something to be desired, but overall you can't beat this app! Pictures do not restore from an old backup but that's ok. I use the desktop app and it's wonderful (the one time fee blows any competitors out of the water).",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,LayZGames,"Amazing, no problems whatsoever. Amazing interface with easy to learn tools. Edit: I have been having issues with the quality of pictures that I receive. Yes, I have changed the max size to the max option, still fuzzy. Would appreciate it if you guys could look into that, thx and keep up the good work.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jack Murphy,"Needs more features. Some way of skirting the issue of getting messages from iPhone users saying ""John loved ""[your message]"""" would be awesome if it's possible. Pulse suffers severely from a message duplication bug, where two consecutive messages say the same thing until the conversation is refreshed. If you've experienced it you'll know it is different from receiving a double text from your carrier, the bug is clearly an issue with Pulse. I've used Pulse for years and highly recommend it.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,So far so good. I like that I can schedule texts to be sent at certain times when I know I will be too busy to remember. I even schedule texts I send to myself for reminders. Update: App will tell me I have a text message and when I go to look there isn't anything new. Also I really like having the option to lock an important message to help prevent it from accidentally deleting but this app don't have that. So you only get 3 stars.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app has great features, but group texts, links, and pictures rarely get sent or recieved. As soon as I downloaded a new app this was fixed. I bought the lifetime subscription as well. This was a waste of money as it only gave me a few more features and I will be uninstalling the app do to the previously mentioned issues anyway. These issues need to be fixed.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Almost perfect! I picked an Android partially for the fun experience. I have all my conversations color coded in messages. Then the update, and suddenly I'm back to a boring, sometimes confusing messaging app that reminded me too much of iMessage. I was thrilled to find pulse. The web app works wonderfully. I love the folder/structure in the app. I can even pick accent colors! 😍 Basically, I have to thank Google for forcing me into a much better user experience with Pulse SMS than I've ever had. Two MINOR things, unless it's user error on my part: would love pics in group texts next to text bubbles, and love to be able to open links directly. (Seems I have to use the upper right dot menu to say open in chrome--UPDATE: TURNED browser as Luke suggested and it's working perfectly). Otherwise thanks for all the other features I didn't know I'd need!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like that conversations can be transferred to a new phone, but I'm disappointed about paying for the Text From Anywhere version. Also, I thought we could assign colors to people in group messages but it now seems to randomly assign colors each time you open the app. It's disorienting when you're looking for a message from Bob and his messages are blue one day, and now Becky's messages are blue. Consistency would be nice",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Searching does not work on the desktop version and this is where I do most of my texting so I need to search on the desktop version too.  This behavior is intentional and you can read about it by searching the word ""search"" in the help documents. It states there is no plan to change this.  I also really would like a forward to my email option like MightyText as I spend a lot of time in email and it is helpful to get copies of texts there.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Removed one star because now whole threads are not showing up in the desktop app, even though I had it open and would have liked to use it for a longer SMS conversation. The contact doesn't even show up in my contact list even though he does in the default messaging app. I really like the interface, but have been having issues receiving messages on the desktop app even though they show up in the mobile app. Haven't missed any messages, it is just weird that those messages never show up in the desktop app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,T. Stark,"I've been using this app for over a year, maybe two, a couple flaws make mediocre. I primarily selected this app for its scheduling function. Great for not forgetting someones B-day, or a message you want to send someone but not in the middle of the night. Schedule the message and 'file and forget'. With that said, as the 3 star rating represents, it's just ok. It looses points for these couple reasons. 1. If you are in a group chat, and typing a message, in certain cases (I've yet to figure out the exact circumstances), if someone in the group sends a message, the message you are typing will be erased as you type. Doesn't happen every time, but enough that's a recognized 'threat', to me. 2. Editing messages more than a couple lines long, when they are in the 'scheduled to send' folder are a royal PitA. You can't see the whole message & therefore can't easily edit the message. The poor work around is use the 'copy/cut...' function. Move one of the "","" to the location that I want to edit it. Disable the 'cut/copy' function, once at the location, and I can edit. PitA. 2B. After editing the message there are ways to leave the message, that you don't get a ""Do you want to save"" option, so you end up loosing your edits. For core sms functions this app is good enough - nothing special. The sms app that came with the previous version of Android was cleaner in it's implementation overall and with scheduling, but the scheduling function was removed for some reason with an update, so the reason for using this app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robert Brend,"Love it. Having the web app is awesome, I probably send over 50% of my texts from my computer, rather than phone. The only complaint is the contact sync to the web app. It often cannot find new contacts or cannot start a conversation with a contact that it cannot find so I end up sending the 1st message through my phone, then the sync works great. The password/fingerprint protected ""Private"" messages section is an awesome feature, too.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Laura Chalifoux,"I love this app! I use it on my phone, tablet, & Windows 10 laptop. Sending and receive texts on whatever device I'm working on is such a huge convenience. I lots of customization features, and extra conveniences like a Quick Share option for sharing content in Android without having to open the Pulse app. But the main reason I switched to Pulse is I can easily see when I receive a group text, so I'm less likely to embarrass myself with an inappropriate reply to the whole group. Excellent app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Open-source, stable, fast, customizable, with great desktop PC integration. Definitely my favorite texting app. A couple features I would like: Ability to compose long texts in a larger space such as a separate pop-up window. Also when a friend texts me from a new number the only option Pulse offers is to save a NEW contact; there is no option to UPDATE existing contact. Other text apps have had this feature for years now.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app and far superior to other texting apps, though it is not without flaws. I use it daily on both my laptop (Chrome browser) and on my cell. Makes saving/searching texts a breeze, no issue with storage, etc. Main complaint is that if you have a lot of contacts, it simply will not pull up the ones you regularly use on the web app, even after refreshing of contacts. The mobile app works fine, but for example, if I want to text Tim Alexander on the web app and start typing ""Tim A"" nothing pops up. Tried everything. If I get a text from Tim I can reply, no problem, and his name shows up, so it's obviously connected to my contacts, and it works just fine in the mobile app, but on the desktop, no funcione. Small gripe about an otherwise excellent app",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,craig watson,"While I've enjoyed using post for several years on a variety of phones but I've upgraded my phone to a Samsung ultra 20g and the app doesn't work as well as a useful mother phones will actually I should say it doesn't work well when you can try to send messages off of your PC while sending messages from the PC it's really clunky it doesn't work as great so if you're thinking of upgrading to a Samsung note 20 g I would think about it twice. update after tweaks from pulse, seems to be working fine. thank you guys.. will keep you posted if any issues.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Edwina May,"Finally! A messaging app with no ads, and sychs my android tablet w/ my phone! I tried every app avail. but none worked. For my needs, pulse is the best and worth every penny of the lifetime subscription! Costs less than 2 months worth of the others. UPDATE 4/14/21:. This app quit syncing with my phone several weeks ago!!! I've tried every setting possible and it doesn't sync, send, or receive anymore. The app is now worthless on my tablet, so I've lost my money and going to uninstall.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,cydonius99,"Very awesome SMS app. It's feature rich and highly customizable. Just the other day, I had to dust the cobwebs of the stock messaging app to turn off emergency alerts due to their unreasonable frequency and irrelevance. I have been using Pulse for so long that it felt like going back to an old house out in the country with its barebones basic atmosphere, drab interior, and lack of plumbing. Pulse is just vastly superior and has been a top 5 app for me for quite some time.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sujan Bryan,"I've tried every text app, but this is the only one that met all of my needs. I especially love the scheduled texts so I don't wake people up, the ability to mark texts as unread so I remember to respond, and the versatility of the format. The automatic response, both general and per contact, is amazing! Pulse is utterly the way to go. And all for completely free. Thank you, Pulse devs!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"ALMOST perfect. This app has everything I could want in a messaging app. Except that video and sound clips do not send, regardless of the size. I've tried to send dozens of videos and recordings to people, and they show that they've sent, but nobody gets them. Fix this and you'll have my 5 star vote",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Works fantastic so far and I love the scheduled texts. I've been using it frequently for about two weeks now. The only minor issue I've had is periodically I try to share a pic and get to the send text screen and there's no picture to send. At that point I just click the add attachment icon and it will upload the picture to the text screen just fine. Very minor issue very great app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"No annoying ads, clean UI. :) :it would be great if the customization for colors for bubbles and conversations was easier to select. Right now it's really vague what it actually affects. Maybe have it like Mood SMS where you can pick the specific text and bubble color for you vs the other person. Other than that this app is now my preferred app for texting. Edit :quick bit of feedback. Please reduce the sensitivity on the swipe gesture for deleting threads. It is way too sensitive.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse is intuitive and reliable. When Android Messages kept crashing I switched over and haven't looked back. The only thing that kept me from rating 5 stars is that the web app contact syncing process is a little complicated and doesn't seem to always work. The vast majority of the time I haven't had any issues.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Agent Tomcat,"Update 5/24/21: this app still doesn't have the ability to save all or some images from a message at once (instead of one at a time or auto-saving everything in the background) or in fact just the ability to select multiple images, or the ability to forward an entire message including images (not just the text). These are pretty basic features of an SMS app, but hey, the devs did manage to make it take 10 minutes just to initialize and optimize the app upon installation, so that's something.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"By far my favorite SMS. Elegant and simple design that just works. Has modern features without a bunch if bloat. I like the backup and cross device capability. Only complaint I have is aesthetic. The interface constantly reassigns colors to different conversations, which can be disorienting when new conversations are introduced or the app is closed and opened again.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very good but needs work. Too few font size settings & choices is an annoying problem. Main prob is, unlike Messages+, for new msgs, does not have a persistent pop-up notification, in the middle of the screen (over other apps as well on locked screen). Why is it that no SMS/MMS app has the ability to jump to an external text editor for writing msgs, with basic text editing features AND, above all else, uses the full screen to display the msg you are writing and has a separate font size setting.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,The Swami,"This used to be a fantastic app and service to use for texting from desktop as well as phone. Unfortunately, ever since Pulse was acquired by Maple Media and transferred over in about November 2020, they have completely messed up the app to the point it no longer functions for Desktop/Chrome Extension. I'm sure they'll reply and say 'oh that's not how this is supposed to work/etc'. no kidding. we all know that. the bottom line is it DOES NOT WORK any longer for that functionality. So if you are looking for something to send/receive texts on Pulse using your PC via Chrome Extension, read the reviews like this one and look elsewhere, because this functionality has not worked in 2 months now.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Finally! A messaging app that does that it should and functions flawlessly. You don't need internet to receive or send pictures, there are no ads, and the interface is sensibly put together with very customisable features. And you know what? An app that works this well for free makes me want to pay for it to promote it. I think I'll purchase the computer messaging, just because.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It was great to be able to backup all text messages to the cloud, switch to a new phone, and then be able to download all those conversations to a new phone. 9/23/2020 Update: Still an amazing app. The biggest convenience is being able to use the web version, that allows me to use a full desktop keyboard. Much easier to type messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Paul DuVal,"Excellent app, and a perfect Android SMS alternative to the standard Samsung SMS. Tried Google Messages and it kept crashing. Others either didn't have all the features I wanted or had too many ads. I like that the function of custom text notification tones is enabled, which is not an option with most other apps. Also like message scheduling, pinning texts from contacts, custom interfaces for different contacts, and being able to ""title"" group SMS.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love the customization, except the forced dark blue background. For real, though it's there best customization out there. This messaging app is also super fast and never crashes. I love it. One star short of perfect, mainly because the integrated camera is distorted on my Galaxy S9+. Actually, I'm gonna bump it back to 5 stars; there are a lot of really good features other apps didn't think of.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Fairly Useful I thought I'd use instead of Android's default, hoping for a step up alternative, but it's simply a basic message app. My biggest gripe is how it separates your text messages with people from your photo/media messages, splitting them so that you have two message ""sections"" with everyone you message with. Too much to keep track of. Also, not reliable with identifying phone numbers as known numbers",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like all the options they give you to edit the style according to your preferences but I have 2 things I'd prefer in this app. First, it would be nice if the image of the individual you were texting was alongside the texts they sent you and second, it would be nice if the app uploaded *all* of the texts, not just the past week.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sebastian Coeme,"I really had high hope for this app as I love the functionality to perform over various platforms. I was very close to suggest to my employer to purchase multiple accounts so that I would be able to communicate with my team effectively. As I type this review, The web app on my pc is YET again stuck on a loading screen. On top of that the contact list does not populate correctly and I forced to create a draft on phone before I can type it on my pc. The concept is great but the quality of the software and server could use some work. I give this 1 start because it has lost my business, disappointed my expectation, complicated reset functions, lack of connectivity. 4 reasons, 4 star deduction.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've been using this app for several months now. I have enjoyed it so much that I bought a subscription for my wife's devices. It is clean, simple and works on just about everything from my PC, Chromebook, tablet, and phone. The function of being able to delay my messages is a feature I use regluarly for work and not wanting to forget to send a message or thought but not wanting to send it early in the morning or late at night. With the FCC changing the way SMS messages are thought of its time to seriously start thinking of using a non-stock messaging service and this one of the main contenders.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeff Hall,"This app is really good and I love using it. I love how customizable it is with color schemes and rules and it is pretty dang close to Apples messages system across devices. However, I give this 4 stars because I have found several bugs/glitches using it. Those examples are: even though I have edited the contact name and saved it, it still shows the previous contact name saved. Rarely messages shoe as sent twice or show they are removed. Over all I still think this app is great to use.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,CLE Momma,"I have always loved this app and paid for it. But the amount of frustration this app gives me with photos and media.. I can't handle it anymore lol. Photos only send to my contacts about 25% of the time, majorly compressed if they do arrive. I constantly have to ask if people received a photo I sent. If you're someone who sends a lot of photos.. this app may not be for you. I do love this app, the color changing themes are great. But the function is low.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Gergetz,The main reason I use Pulse is because it has a browser-based web access to be able to send and receive text messages from my windows computer. That's massively important to me and the vast majority of apps that claim to do that stink at it. I'm only giving this three stars though because contact synchronization in the web app is unreliable. Klinker really needs to work on that. Also a minor mark against it is a wonky copy function when trying to copy text from past messages on the phone.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is more about the paid feature of sending and receiving messages on other devices. It used to be good. I used to love it, it was great getting and sending messages on/from my computer. But now, messages don't show up on the computer, the pulsesms site at times just doesn't load, and more recently, I could send a message and it won't actually send until about an hour or 2 later. And it isn't like my phone was off or anything, after I started noticing this, I would have my phone in hand, PulseSMS open, and use the web interface to send a message, and it just wouldn't send. Then an hour or more later, it would finally send. Really disappointed that I paid $10.99 for something that doesn't even work right.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've used this app for a very long time and have always loved it. However, for a few months now, some of my messages come in VERY delayed or not at all. Many times, pictures that are sent to me won't download or show up. I uninstalled Pulse for a week and used a different app and didn't experience any of those issues.

xyz.klinker.messenger,S Servin,"Update 3/2022: app has become unacceptable. Grammatical errors, adds words, randomly sends. I switched to a different app. Exceptional! I was looking for a good but simple messaging app. Pulse is great. Allows me to delay messages for a few seconds, schedule messages and use the microphone for messages. It's really good, not at all quirky, no issues or problems.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The app is great. Very well-made. Everything is streamline and colorful and easy to use. ******The one feature I don't like about this app is..... when you delete messages in most texting apps, it delete all the messages from that person.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Danielle Ross,"EDITED: the last few weeks have been pretty buggy. Messages won't send until I clear cache and sometimes history.

It works from my desktop, multiple phones, my tablet and my watch.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"For $11 one time fee, you can't go wrong with this app. I just love it so much. It made complete sync among my Note 8, Galaxy Tab S4, and Windows PC. No delays on any devices. SMS and MMS are synced flawlessly. It also supports Korean, so that is huge plus for me. Multi-line messages displays fine. For the person who uses calls and text messages for comminication with clients just like me, this app is a must-have. Whatsapp, Kakaotalk, and Line message apps are good, but not all of my clients are using 1 app, so I have to go back and forth with 3 apps. Therefore, basic text is still the best place to communicate and store the conversasion for all of my clients. Now those conversasions are synced among all of my devices. I can't be happier. Thank you.",5

I'm on a new set of phones and have been experiencing the same issues that I had previously blamed on my old phone. I used to be very impressed, but the PC app still crashes; the Wear OS app doesn't always sync; and notifications are a disaster especially in later versions of Android. Bubble messaging issues. Might have to make my own.",3

I tried other texting apps that weren't satisfactory.  This is a great app.  I love that you can set repeating notifications, so I have uninstalled Light Flow. I would have given it 5 stars if only it had the option to insert Bitmojis into it when you press the attachment option.    Update: Changed the keyboard to GBoard and was able to use Bitmojis.   However, I realized that I could only set individual contact text notifications tones for the current conversation.  When the conversation is deleted, so is the individual text sound.  I added SMS Popup so I can permanently assign a different tone for each contact. Update: SMS Popup stopped working, so I am on the hunt for something else. I tried Mood, which was good until I realized that the individual contact alert sounds don't work when the text includes other people.

I wish there was more customization on vibrations and sounds like textra. The only thing I really hate is the search function on the web is just terrible. It can only search 75 conversations. The developer knows this and has no plans to change it. I wish there was an option to be able to search through all my messages even at the sacrifice of ""privacy"".. whatever that even means these days.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So very good. Loved the app right away and already signed for device sync. I really hope this service sticks around and continues to improve! Not sure if android allows it, but i would love if all phone calls could be handled by this app, and sync across devices as well. (Apple does this on ios and mac for example). The device sync and automatic SMS backups are amazing, and definitely worth the very low price! Many thanks to the developer!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Libby S,Update. My only complaint is the web interface that is required for use on iPad is a tiny bit better but still hard to use. Original One thing to be aware of is that this only world's on an ipad with their web application which is very clunky and slow. You can see your messages and even send one eventually but I try to avoid using it there. But on my Android it is great and it's fine on my Macbook,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I was having so much trouble with Google's messages for the web on my computer. I would have to log out and log back in after sending or receiving a message from my PC. It was frustrating, as you can imagine. After trying many things suggested, I decided to try another messaging app that offered the ability to work from my PC. As soon as I downloaded and started using Pulse, my problem was solved. I have been using it now for 5 days without a single issue. I am extremely satisfied and so grateful that I found it. It makes managing my messaging a breeze. And, the PC and phone parts of the app are beautiful. They're just a pleasure to use. I give it 5 stars!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,RJ Dunn,"Pretty good. But, I wish I could add conversations to multiple folders. And I wish the folders were one click away. My biggest annoyance though is that I can't easily send text to multiple people individually, but that this setting has to be changed in global settings. There are lots of good SMS apps, this is one of them, but none have compiled all the right features in to one. What I like: I can name group convos. It has good auto response features. It looks and runs smooth.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This ap does what it says in real time! I test it from time to time with my phone and tablet side by side and I'll send a text on the phone and BAM! It pops right up on the tablet! The same when texting from tablet or web. One improvement? It needs to be more behind the scenes when changing phones so they all stay connected. I couldn't sync messages after getting new phone, but could continue to send from all they just didn't show on the others. Very confusing until I got into the help FAQ.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is awesome. I got tired of Google Messages dropping connection with the web client constantly. Pulse is a lot more stable in that regard and has WAY more features than Google Messages. I love the scheduled messages function, and the UI in general is just great. This is the best alternative texting app I've found. Used it for 2 days and was sold, bought the lifetime license. Keep up the great work!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a great app if you are concerned with other apps invading your privacy using the default app. I have been using it without issues or concerns. It has simple color schemes that are customizable for each contact as well as notifications. To have the ability to backup and text from another device other than your phone requires payment. I really like this feature because I am able to see messages while I work on my computer or tablet and respond to them without pulling out my phone. Very much like WhatsApp(Facebook) and Hangouts(Google), but without Big Brother watching.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,lee perez,It has everything ive wanted from several different messengers in one. This IS the most complete messenger. You can even message from a computer which is great in case you ever forget your phone somewhere. The only thing I don't like is that you can't put a picture on your conversation backgrounds. Being Android phones are all about customization I feel this is kind of important for the texting experience,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dow Wilson,"Really enjoy this app. It's perfect for having access to texts on my computer as well. The interface still needs a little work. It would be nice to be able to create groups in a contact list for single clicking availability. Texts with video seem to also be a problem for the web app, but works fine in mobile. Overall, I recommend this app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"With more and more messaging apps eclipsing sms, it is still nice to have an app that allows you to access your SMS messages through means other than your phone. I think that, for now, the fee associated with this service is still worth it and when I paid for it the feature was a game changer. Now, though, I question if it's niche is enough. At the very least, the UI is simple and beautiful and it offers something other competitors don't. Seems like a 5 star app to me.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I have had the Pulse app for several months now. I've tried other SMS applications and this is my favorite by far. I have the paid version and It syncs perfectly with my desktop and laptop. I would recommend to anyone who has a desk job that would rather type their text then use their phone. It works fine on my phone I'm just faster typing than actually texting.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Hoppy Sparkles,"Just downloaded it on a rec to go with my Samsung Watch 3. Not impressed so far but it does at least share messages. My complaints are that there isn't an icon that shows up on top of everything else in spite of allowing it to be on top and when I have a link in a text eg Petsmart or Joann, the link is broken and only goes to a page that simply says, Joann or Petsmart. There are also some other settings I would like control of but can learn to live without. After a month, I may go back to Mood.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jason Hudson,"I think it's a good app. Dislikes: I don't like the steps needed to log in if you can't remember your password. They backup everything but I would still like to be able to save everything to my own file on pc. I accidentally made 2 accounts, first was a 1year subscription, 2end lifetime subscription. Would be nice to join the 2 together. THE END",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A superb app. The ability to define text templates and modify them after they've been selected is incredibly useful, at least to this professional driver who needs a large inventory of such reusable texts for airport pickups for different terminals, etc. First class and well worth the pittance they charge for a lifetime subscription. Would be nice to have the ability to report incoming texts as spam as one can do with the native Android texting app, but perhaps that will be added at some time.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jean Roth,"Update 1/13: More issues sending photos. Many never go through. Messages on Mac often appear as pending ""sending."" A wishlist item - I wish I could mark texts as ""liked"" etc. Just paid subscription but looking for alternative bc the photo issue is a problem. 12/20 Love being able to text across devices. However, I've been having lots of issues lately with the app not refreshing to show new messages, and photos that often don't go through. Certain media can't be sent as well.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Amazingly powerful app. Never have any performance issues, is very responsive and simplistic and is decently customizable. I bought the lifetime subscription to text from any device, and I haven't had a single issue with it. I am not regretting the purchase and I definitely see myself using this service for a long time to come!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Rush,Absolutely the best SMS app. Loaded with features and very solid. I especially like the feature that allows you to set a delay timer before the text is sent ... time to read over and catch any last second mistakes. I have mine set for 10 seconds. Also like the ability to schedule a text delivery. Great app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse Stevens II,#NAME?,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,•Gefroren •,"It used to run perfectly fine, but now I can't see my entire message history (for example, messages that go back to August aren't there anymore, and they stop after a few weeks. When I check on the default messenger on my phone, they're still there. Its just that pulse doesn't show my entire messaging history now for whatever reason. Hopefully this bug can be fixed, as this app works well otherwise. It doesn't duplicate my messages or bug out other than by what I described! Fix this bug please",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,BR Cope,"Great and simple texting app with loads of features and advantages. It's very user friendly and intuitive. The text conversation features for links are a great aspect. Most importantly, it is open source and private. Signing up for an account is worth it because it is very inexpensive considering the extra features. Plus, messages are automatically backed up. Love it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jon W.,"Maybe I Am Missing Something... I can't seem to find a way to set individual notification sounds for each contact. Also, the very misleading setting, Sound Effect should be called, Sent Message Sound. Even more annoying, is that sound and it is either on or off but can't be changed. The rest of the app seems pretty decent though. I like it better than Textra and Android Messages. It just needs to be a little more customizable and look a little more polished to get a 5 star rating from me.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,RYAN SIMMONS,"Paid for the year subscription from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. I got it primary so I can use windows to text and synchronize to my phone. I thought my subscription just ended and didn't give it another thought as it stopped working about a month before subscription actually ended. It would say login error saying my subscription ended. When I got charged for the next year, I contacted them on the 23rd about it. No response. So I canceled with google about 4 days later and got refunded. Thank goodness google allowed for a refund. Go an email by Pulse on the 29th that said I canceled and they could not help. I am not the only person that has complained about the login error. The windows app has a lot of glitches and does not always send the text when you hit enter and does not synchronize very well. I would give the app a 3 star, but because of slow response from the developer, it gets a 1 star.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rod Hill,"Works pretty good for the most part. Lot of features are available which increases its usability. The only issue I have is attaching multiple pictures to a text message. It may be me doing it wrong but usually when I try to tap one or more pics, before I tap the next pic, I'm back to the message.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Seth McDonald,"Love the app. But eventually started dropping the quality of videos I sent, then pictures and videos stopped sending completely. When I switched back to my old default messaging app my pics and videos went through no problem. This is a big enough problem that I have to stop using an app that's otherwise great. Hope it gets fixed.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"app works prett well most of the time on the smartphone side. First issue is that this does not support a native ipad app, something I think the website kind of misleading about when it says ipad support. Second issue is that the cloud sync has been awful for me. I have about half my messages that don't sync to the cloud and are only seen on my phone. Third issue is that if I use the google assistant to send a text, the text does not show up on pulse anywhere.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"For me this app is like the iMessage of Android. everything just works really well, including the online syncing of SMS messages. Google messages is ok for a free alternative, but it's not even close to updating messages as quickly without issues. I'm thinking about buying this but when the free version is good enough to switch.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really like the integration. I use it on my tablet and phone. I'd really love more customization, however, especially with look and feel. I switched over from textra which I used for a long time and it was free. I payed for this awesome app for the integration but again would love customization on the level of textra. Definitely would earn 5 stars after that.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Au. Ch.,"If you have an issue with your account, don't expect support to ever contact you back. I think they want people to lose their paid features and make you re-buy their new subscription model or pay $100... Ever since it got bought out I've been having issues with the app, I don't think the original developer is working on it anymore, or anyone for that matter. You're better off using a different texting app that can support computer access. It's a shame because this was my go to SMS app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It works ok but missing some functions other apps have. It is a little clunky. I'd like to see the windows platform include a choice to have a popup remain on screen until I acknowledge it. I sometimes dont see texts until later because the notification only stays for a few seconds. As for clunky the windows app on my desktop takes forever to open and select a text.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Billy Willoughby,"I was looking for a replacement for the stock messaging app. This was the first one I thought had a chance. My biggest complaint with the stock app is the fact that it over compressed my pictures when sending via MMS, and the other Androids in my family don't do that. This one while it has a web interface, works when it wants to. It will actually tell me it sent a message, and my recipient will never get it and later when I check my phone it never shows up on my phone. I can't trust it.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Jeffries,"Better than the default texting app, but not without its own issues. Some of the integration into the OS is not ideal, but I think some of it is due to Android making it harder to integrate (send via menus in other apps, etc). Worked better on my previous phone (LG V20) but not so well on my Pixel 3A XL. Still better than the native app tho.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really like the features. Sync between devices and backup is wonderful. Nice to talk on the desktop where I can type much quicker. And Luke Klinker is wonderful when it comes to needing help. I needed assistance a few times and got things working almost immediately. Of all the apps I use. Pulse is preferred for texting. Have had it for several years and dont plan to switch. I like the dark options the most aswell as its easier on my eyes and keeps the light away.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Missing for me is background photo customization. That's not a deal breaker, but it would make the app elite for me. I also didn't notice assigning messaging sounds for individuals. Perhaps I missed it. think this app is phenomenal. Especially how I can get texts on other devices. Allowing me to turn my phone completely off to charge sometimes is worth getting the alone. I'm extremely impressed.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Susan Paul,This is a really cool app. I like that you can schedule; it's super convenient. One area for improvement — being able to share media with a scheduled text; this hasn't worked properly for me on the free version. The images aren't included when the text is sent. Overall it useful and I would recommend it.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is amazing. Allows archiving (clearing up the inbox without actually deleting messages), which is a pretty basic feature all sms apps should have but most don't, allows scheduling of messages (including group texts). Also texting from PC for a reasonable one time fee. Only thing I would add is, on the web messaging, make a tab itself change as a notification that a new message has arrived.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Razzano Family,There are a lot of things this app can do that many others cannot. I like that you can pin important conversations. I like that there's a Web based version. I like that you can schedule conversations for a later date... but there are differences between the interfaces that I wish didn't exist. UPDATE: Much of the above still holds true and I wanted to add that contacts syncing doesn't always work which is very frustrating. I did a re-sync of my messages which then cleared all my settings!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tracker Scout,"One of the best out there. I love that I can open it on a browser on pc and share links, photos, and text, and receive text. I wish though when sharing a YouTube video that it would write the name of the song along with the image, like many messaging apps do. Is great it does show an image/thumbnail preview of video/song though. I love can pin important people to the top, and love that you can call someone quick with button above text when texting someone. One of the best SMS apps out there!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Olyver Thew,"It works very well, and is relatively customizable. You can schefule messages and archive them, block numbers or mute conversations. Also use gifs, and other various media messages to send. I do wish i could change the background in each text log or set personalized message notifications for ppl, or change the color of the message bubbles. Overall great working app, had no issues.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Day,"RARELY rate apps, but had to in this case. This app WORKS! It works just about perfectly across all my devices. Others like this were missing the boat big time! The developer takes the time to respond to each message as welll, so you will get the best help possible from the source! GET IT! UPDATE: thank you for resolving the issue of not being able to use any web browser to access.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris topher (Computer Chris),"Fantastic app. The watch Gear OS could be faster starting up and should be better at claiming Default SMS status. But overall, very useful when juggling multiple devices. Suggestion box:  Failed messages should stand out more and have a separate notification category. One marked clearly as important or critical. Perhaps even have their own category in the side bar menu, along side the private & scheduled folder list.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Anthony Agu,"Terrible. I can't send message to more than 10 people. I bought this app so that l can send messages to large groups. I have uninstalled and installed the app. However, the problem still persist. The app has great features but in practice, the app is not working for me. I have contacted support severally for help but they have not been able to resolve the issue. What is a message app if the app can't send message.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nat,"I really like this app, but I wish there was a way to turn off thumbnails for videos I send- edit: this app isn't working properly nowadays. photos don't send properly, often not at all, and I can't switch to a different app because it causes a bug in my default messages where every photo I have ever sent to any contact RESENDS SIMULTANEOUSLY. this is a nightmare.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,MM Ahmenatu,"OMG! This app is on Fire! Download quite a few scheduling apps that had crazy ads embedded in the messages being constant with busy screens. Although it's only been 24hrs, but everything the app promised is there and more! I can actually schedule a message to emails. I like the way this app emulates my original phone texting interface and makes it easy to use within seconds. Lastly, I like the option to have messages organized by time sent! Must have app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nancy Williams,"I like Pulse EXCEPT(!) that, because it only shows the first name in a group text I have more than once accidentally sent messages to groups when I intended only to send them to individual people. This is dangerous and potentially very embarrassing. After doing that one too many times, I switched to Verizon's app, which makes it much easier to see that a text was a group text. But please fix this problem and I'll come back because otherwise I like Pulse better.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jaque Elf,"The concept is great but the application is lackluster at best. Doesn't sync consistently or accurately across devices, seems to lag often, hit or miss in sending pics or links...i started with a month to month subscription so i could have real world experience seeing how well the app performance is across multiple devices. Currently, i don't think i'll be upgrading to lifetime because it doesn't work well. I'll give it one more month to see if it improves before i cancel subscription & leave 🚶",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is almost perfect for me as user coming from the iOS environment. Only thing missing I'd like to see is a time stamp on ALL messages sent or recieved.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Krystal Geddes,"I loved this app at first but as soon as I started paying it started messing up. I wouldn't receive messages or recipient wouldn't receive messages then it just stopped working and as soon as I open it, it closes and says ""pulse keeps stopping"" yet I continue to be charged every month even though I have explained it to the creators and asked them to cancel.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Omar Romero,I've owned this app for at least 2 years. It is simply outstanding. Great customization options. I don't bother to try any other SMS app. The ability to use it on a computer through a web browser has been invaluable. Lately every once in a while I will not be able to send pictures. The text is sent and received but not the picture. Uninstall and reinstall will work to fix the problem for a few weeks.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nicholas Ferrari,"Seems great. Not giving five stars bc it's too expensive. And if you don't pay, it shows you an annoying overlay asking you to upgrade. I don't like ads, and I don't like subscription models. The one-time purchase price is insanely high. But as an SMS app, it's awesome. Although I wish you could change the font color and the color for your own text bubbles in conversations.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rachel,"Great texting app! Very easy to use, great customization options, and I love being able to text from my computer. I do wish it didn't have the ""quick send"" feature for sending photos since it actually adds an unnecessary extra click when selecting how I want to send my photos, but that's literally my only criticism. Edit: The quick send feature for sharing photos now shows up as a separate option, must have been a Google photos/Android OS update!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brodie Gullic,"(12/8) Lifetime Membership has a bug where it does not recognize anymore. I reached out to support and they tried to resolve the issue, but they have not managed to fix the actual problem. Other than that, I love the texting application.

Fluidity and cleanliness of UI are two points of emphasis for me and my view of an application, and this one surpasses my expectations. Fantastic and responsive dev only adds to the experience. My only complaint is that I do occasionally miss MMS in this app that are otherwise received in the native app or Android Mesaages. I have tried MMS APN settings for my carrier, but to now avail. For this final point alone, the app loses a star for 4/5 overall.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Vincent N Erica Shaw,"On the both sides of the messages, there's wasted space on the Surface Duo, so it's a small column in folded mode. When in book mode or tablet, it still has the empty space, but looks on enough because it's so large a canvas spanned across 2 screens. Also, assigning messages to folders should be doable from the main screen when selecting multiple messages. As it is, it takes far too many clicks when buried under menus, over many messages.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alex Isabel,Terrible Bug. I used to love this app. Got a lifetime subscription years ago but now it just causes issues. Whenever I uninstall the app and it goes back to my default Samsung messaging app it automatically triggers text messages that get sent out to everyone without my permission. It's terrible I had to factory reset my phone to stop the texts from going out. The issue never happened until I started using Pulse SMS.

Glancing I can tell easily what I hadn't read yet. Cons: If u could create a thicker line for send delay. Its pretty thin, And I missed one with the glare. And appearance falls a tad behind Textra's I don't care about that cuz it's good still",5

Pulse SMS has a desktop component which can be used cross platforms, supposedly. I have a Surface and I recent was assigned a Macbook Air for my professor duties. Now, at least once per week, it seems I'm having to ""Refresh"" my account because the password I know I set a week ago is correct, but one or more of the desktop apps won't log in using the credentials. Because of its ""end to end"" encryption, the developer says they cannot simply provide a password reset because they use the password as the encryption key - that is not acceptable. There should be simple way of resetting the password and decrypting the messages. I don't know what it is, but others seem to make it work despite high-level security.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve DeBow Jr,"Used to love the app then I tried looking back at an old message that was no longer able to be loaded. Only a few months seem to load now. Not sure if this is due to an update or not. Main reason for using the app was its ability to save all messages. Basically a pay version of kik, messages disappear after they reach a certain (unknown limit)... As far as I can tell, the app is headed in a downward spiral. So buyer beware. This issue is still not resolved after numerous updates & reinstalls",1

The only complaint I can come up with is that a text will occasionally say ""sending"" on my laptop, while it had already sent on phone and watch.

xyz.klinker.messenger,W TF,"Best SMS app I've found. I originally thought that the app was choosing strange proper nouns instead of common words (""Nevis"" instead of ""before"", ""Rast"" instead of ""that"", etc.) Developers say that that's caused by the keyboard, not the app. Fortunately, you can choose to remove the prediction of words you don't want. Over all, Pulse SMS is pretty intuitive as far as sentence structure and prediction.",4

If you want to be able to send and receive text messages from your browser, tablet, or a windows app, this program is excellent. Highly recommended",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pretty good, has a scheduled text feature which is why I use it. However, after an Android update it starts re-sending very old messages and pictures (MMS). We are currently out of the country, an android update installed and my fiance just received a dozen photos from up to a year ago. It's concerning but also at international rates. Who else is receiving old text messages? I have no idea, there is no indication it's even sending messages. It has even done this at 2 AM.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,(Edited #2): The MMS function has stopped working. Recipients are no longer receiving images sent. (Edited) It is a great app with browser support so that I can easily communicate via text without having to have my phone next to me. Customization is simple and it works well. Thank you dev for getting back to me promptly and I enjoy this app very much!,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick Santy,"2/1/2021. Ok, Finally working as designed. I'm satisfied now. Support was very helpful. Thanks guys. It is awesome to be able to send/receive texts on my phone, desktop, and tablet. Great app! Disregard the following: 1/25/2021. I wrote that more than a year ago. Now it doesn't sync, messages are delayed, msg's sent are not received. I have been trying to resolve for days. I am very disappointed, so much so, that I will change messaging apps. Goodbye Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jon Kotowski,Pretty darn good. Bordering on great. Nothing to lose a star over. I put it on my phone because it works well with my Galaxy watch. Only things that I wish it would do is let you adjust LED color notifications per person It says you can't because of a Google issue. But I have other text apps then do. I wish there were notification icons for different contacts. And the window where you type your text is smaller than I would like. Still - very good!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Haikaz Dermenjian,"Overall great app definitely worth the price tag. But, after several months of use I have to admit this is by far one of the most buggy apps I have ever owned. Web interface and phone SMS app go out of sync A LOT !!! Meaning you cat text on the web but on the phone it wont show up so then you are not sure did it go through or not? When you text same text duplicates on the phone although it's just one line. You send a text and it just does nothing but sit there. Just to much headache and sadly I need to uninstall. I think worst part was reaching out to the dev and not getting any response at all. I get he's 1 guy but these are major issues. A lot of potentical just to many bugs can't deal with it anymore. Fun while it lasted. Note 8 user. Updating previous issues I had with my Note 8 I found the issue. A) Main issue was Verizon sending texts to from Android to Apple users. B) Note 8 is just to slow and buggy to use with this app. Now I'm not sure if Verizon ever fixed the issue or not but I did open many tickets with zero response. Long story short after moving to T-Mobile and upgrading to Note 20 all my issues are resolved and I'm a happy camper. Love this APP and I use it daily! Thank you dev and sorry for bad review earlier wish I knew this when I wrote the 1st one. Cheers",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Morris,I've been having issues with my Pulse app for the past 2 days. I've had no connectivity on my phone or desktop apps for periods of time. I've also had issue with browser app at the same time to confirm it's not any of my devices. I currently have more significant issues with sending messages. Receiving messages is much more consistent then sending currently from my mobile phone. The desktop app and also the browser app and extension do not send messages at all currently. Is there something going on with the system or my account? I tried to perform an account reset and that was unsuccessful also.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Darryl Franks,"Update: Upgraded from 2 stars to 5! It turns out that my issue was with myself! My devices were not synced because I never set up my account properly. After deleting account and creating login info I'm now able to sync data between phone, tablet, and laptop. FYI; you DO NOT lose data when deleting and creating a new account. I've tried several SMS apps over the years and Pulse is the best choice!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,danred99,Best app I've found for text messaging. Discovered it when looking for a way to backup my messages outside of the standard google backup system. I only use it on my phone and not across my devices as it's designed for. Would be nice if I could easily add additional people to a group text that has already been started.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Roedema,"I'd happily used this app for about a year and a half. It's certainly one of the better options for desktop text messaging. However, I've gotten annoyed with some messages not syncing or appearing out of order. Though I'd paid $10.99 for a lifetime membership, I'm now testing out the free Your Phone desktop app and Your Phone Companion mobile app from Microsoft, as well as the web versions of Verizon Messages and Messages for Web from Google.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alvin Mast,"This is a mostly good app. There are some bugs in ""private conversations"". Sometimes it will get get ""conversation list"" and ""private conversations"" mixed up. (If you don't use that function it is irrelevant to you) Otherwise the Android version is good. The desktop version for Linux doesn't have a resizeable window so that is a downside.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Okay so I'm leaving my review at 3 stars but I'll add more specifics. The app is pretty much perfect in most areas but lacking in others. The integration between using it on your PC and on your phone is pretty much flawless. There's decent customizability and the flexibility to use it on your PC is awesome. I think the app has a lot of potential for growth. Unlike Textra, Pulse does not support iOS emojis as a customization option. As silly as it sounds, everyone knows that iOS has the best emojis. And I think if an app like Textra can incorporate them, Pulse should too. Especially given the fact that it's main goal is to emulate the ability imessage has of sending texts through your PC. Add support for this and include more customization and I'll give it 5 stars easy and buy the app outright",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryan Sloan,"Fantastic web message integration with no battery drain! Great that you can search for emojis by using the "":smile:"" coding. The phone app is fast, and well laid out. Feature Requests: - Roll up the menu options on the web interface to put the conversations closer to the top. - Add GIF search to the web interface. - Spread out the web layout a little bit so it expands most of the screen rather than just the center. Great work!!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Came back to Pulse from Google Messages.  Messages on the web is a great idea, but not implemented near as well as Pulse.  MotWeb was all the time disconnecting and would not be able to send/receive messages for a time.  With Pulse i have a great responsive desktop app i can use on Windows while i'm at work.  Pulse also allows me to text on devices that are not as Google friendly, such as Kindle Fires and Linux, etc.  As an SMS app on my phone, it works great and the feature and customization set are second to none.  I've especially made use of the ""delay to send"" feature.  It has allowed me to catch would-be unfortunate miss-types.  For all these features $11 is such a great value.  Look at the details of the app, everything is honest and straight-forwardly detailed for you.  No hidden costs or surprises.  In the world of the app store that is a refreshing concept.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I got this app as a stopgap when Verizon Messages+ bugged out. Pulse works just fine, though more control over the notifications would be nice (double vibrate and you can't change it?). Biggest, most looming issue - NO iOS VERSION. I understand that's not the dev's fault, but c'mon. What's the point of ""syncing between devices"" if it can't sync to half of all devices?",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Curtis Kinsler,"The design of this app is amazing. The MMS issue has been apparent for years (during the original developer days) with seemingly no resolution. Maybe it is the ""carrier not delivering"" issue, doesn't matter as it's still an issue that doesn't happen when using another app. Until that is fixed I cannot recommend, or use this app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrea Yun,"I love this app, but I can no longer send videos over text. No I used to be able to, but haven't been able to for months. I've tried to reinstall and to send small video files, but to no avail. Otherwise awesome app. Editing to minus one star because video is still unavailable to me. I might have to go to a different app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is amazing, it beats any other app I have ever used. They should honestly have some of these features as a purchased add-on, this app does absolutely everything for free and it does it better or equivalent to everyone else while combining any setting of 2020 you could want. Archiving? They got it, swipe left or right, dark theme? Defaults on my device, very easy to change and customize. For those who want privacy, well that's in here too with a secure area.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,V,"I've used this app for years and have paid for subscription. I usually love it, but recently it's been constantly crashing and seems to have issues sending and receiving MMS messages, and sometimes these issues cause my whole phone to freeze up. I'm not sure what happened, but I wish it still worked like it used to!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Good free app, and I really like that it's ad-free. But I'm having a glitch with colors randomizing in group chats. I've submitted the bug on the GitHub issue tracker, it just hasn't been fixed yet. Great app. The random colors is a bit distracting, though, so I've switched back to the app my phone came with.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far absolutely wonderful. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that I haven't had it long enough to see if there is something that annoys me. This app is very visually appealing. The lay out is wonderful; it is like your email and has a folder to archive texts. You can set up repeating reminders to people through texts. You can customize each contact, both the colors and the notification sounds. It also uses the whole screen on your phone to display messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Roger Asbahr,"Really a nice app. A breeze to use, backs up and rebuilds your text data easily and offers many useful features. And now it's Oct, 2021, two years later and I absolutely love this program. Has so many very useful features and it works so reliably and smoothly. Backs up and restores your texts easily, works simultaneously on multiple platforms. Give yourself a gift and go with Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cherish Grabau,"I paid for it, but I wish I hadn't. The app usually works fine on my phone - I don't receive all of my texts, but I do get most of them. However, the main reasons I bought Pulse were to read/reply to texts on my Samsung Galaxy Active watch and my iPad, and unfortunately most of the time neither of those features work. My watch receives notifications but doesn't allow me to read the text, type a reply, or send a new text. I get the notification and have to dig out my phone. The web page (Chrome browser on my iPad) doesn't let me respond to texts and only sometimes lets me read texts, and not all of them are listed. I'll keep giving it a chance, but I'm probably not installing it on my next phone.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Bascom,Great stand-alone sms app. Good dark theme. Vibrant colors. Customization is superior to Android's native sms app. 4 ⭐ for texting on other devices. I randomly need to text on a browser. Key word: randomly. 99¢/month is pricy for the one or two times I'd need this feature. $36.99 lifetime membership even more so. I've only had the app a few weeks. I'm not sure I want to spend that much money. $5.99 lifetime instead of yearly and I would have done it. For now web.whatsapp + copy/paste = success,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Really liked this app, and it didn't suffer from some performance problems I was experiencing with stock android messenger. I've since switched back, however, as I frequently run into an issue where I don't receive some group texts, leaving me with a partial conversation and no indication that I'd missed any messages (other than the conversation seeming weird). This makes it absolutely unusable for me, as I need to be able to rely on receiving all messages.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kris Wood,"I decided to purchase the ad-free version, on the recommendation of a friend. I love being able to use it on my desktop AND my phone, even at the same time. The desktop version does limit the size of pics, and if I am frequently sending pics, it starts getting a little glitchy, but I found that if I completely close the window and re-open it, it seems to get rid of the problem.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app! I came across it trying to get my Samsung Active 2 watch the send and receive texts. It works really well with my phone and the watch, too. The only problem I have with it is when I've just sent a text and leave open the person I'm texting, expecting a response soon, the app does not notify me that I have an incoming text from that person. I have to remember to exit the person's name that I am communicating with in order to be notified of the next text. It's just an inconvenience that I need to get used to.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app met my three basic criteria. 1. It allows blocking of numbers and keeps a list of the blocked numbers. 2. It has a good, interactive widget that I can put on a home screen. 3. It allowd you to easily see the time each individual text was sent. As an added bonus, it is free with no adds.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick Snowman,"Great if you want to schedule messages. Also has a great feature to set a delay of several seconds, which you can adjust in settings, to avoid those OOPS! moments when you accidentally send a text before you're done editing it. Simple and intuitive. My favorite SMS had by far.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Near-perfect overall, but Pulse cannot delete an individual message from a conversation--it deletes from Pulse, but message remains in the stock app (tested on Android 7); a major flaw for a dedicated texting app that will surely be fixed soon. Would like ability to use the color wheel to choose specific Base Theme day/night colors to override the current white/blue-green static combo, and to change the color of the app icon. Uninstalled for now; will try again later. Keep up the good work, dev!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dasi,"I used to love this app. But I lost my password & used the password reset option. I've tried so many times. I never received and email to reset it. I contacted customer support & they sent me the same link. I emailed them and told them that it doesn't work. I didn't get a response except for the ""Rate your support you received."" I opened another ticket & nothing. It's frustrating. I don't want to lose my messages & block list- especially when I pay for this service. I'm disappointed with them.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Enid Gertmenian,"I had been using Pulse because it offered delayed send. Recently, I had to reinstall it to get the desktop version to work on my iPad and after doing this Pulse completely screwed up my contacts. Names are mismatched with numbers and, as had happened before, it sent random pictures and very old text messages to random people in my contacts. Extremely dissatisfied and concerned this will affect my business. Update: same HUGE problems, unhelpful bot responses from ""customer support"". AVOID APP!!",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Marsha HT,"I am just trying out this new messaging app. So far it's pretty amazing, nice interface and love the customization. However, there is one thing annoys me is the interruption. For instance, I was texting with my sister. But I won't be able to text until I read her incoming message before I can continue. It literally stops me from texting, so I was force to read her message first before I go back to my texting. Very annoying when new messages keeping popping up asking me to ""read"".",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Z G,"Struggles to sync with my laptop sometimes. I resynced but it caused some data loss. Otherwise my experience with the app has been amazing and I reccomend it highly. This is my default messaging app and I could not be more satisfied wirh the powerful services, flexibility and good-looking user interface it provides.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Book Of Oz Ozzy,"Solid text app but needs: to be easier at selecting personalization of text alerts/unique sounds of who texts you can be done but is convoluted; Specific Text msgs that can be locked (doesn't archive);option to add confirmation of deleting=>too easy to swipe+delete-at least there is an undo button that shows up for a bit. Love ""out of office"" option, pinning important contacts, auto change to darker nighttime colors option, you can use other keyboards, etc",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dominick Thompson,"The best sms experience I've found on android. Feature rich, but not without bugs. There's some scaling issues on the windows 10 app (fixed now! 😊), an image resize problem that occasionally irks me on web/pc platforms, some missing contacts when texting from other devices, and occasionally a de-sync bug that sends old, failed messages. No other app I've tried has matched the usability and features of pulse, so I will continue to use their platform, regardless of occasional glitches.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall it is a pretty good app, simple and well fuctioning. The only downside is that there is no way to search text within convetsation. The ""Search"" option will show up only in the top main page. Once getting into individual conversation, that ""Search"" option is gone. Hope author could fix that, then it will be a perfect app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Medium Chungus,"Subscribed for PC access and scheduled messages. Now the default Message app handles that, no problem. I dealt with the images not consistently sending/arriving. With the clumsy sync stutter when I'd switch devices. The constant ""this image is too large"" when I'd try and send *nominal* screenshots over pc. Finally pulled the plug when several of my threads just up and disappeared today. Not archived. Just gone. Meh.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I wouldn't have love to give this app 5 Stars I really wanted it to work. Unfortunately too many features for me don't work, possibly cuz I'm on Oreo, or maybe it's cuz I'm on a custom rom I don't know but the default messaging app for Android does not have these issues. The biggest issue I have is group messaging in the settings is enabled to message as a group however in reality it is sending individual messages and I triple checked and it is enabled in the settings but it is still not working. Second of all when I go to change the ringtone it changes just fine in the settings but when I receive a message it remains my default notification sound again and issue. Other than that it runs really smooth and I was really hoping I can replace Android messaging because Android messaging does not run so smooth. But I suppose I will keep searching.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It has some syncing issues with my comp - I have to go through the whole delete your account sync cycle at least 2x a year. It isn't great with group messages.

I was happy to pay for the pro version.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It does everything you expect from an SMS app and more. Everything is working good so far but the only recommendation I have is to have an option to remove the timestamp from the conversation list. I know that I texted someone today or last week, I just don't want my conversation list cluttered with different timestamps of when I texted someone.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Design is great. Simple to use and has nice customization options. I definitely like this app better than the one my phone came with by default. No ads is the biggest plus for me. Only complaints I have is that there's no pop-up short cut to reply to messages and keep a conversation open like with Messenger. Also, sending gifs is weird. It makes you send them separately to a specific person when ideally I'd like to just tap on the one I want to use in the convo and then confirm sending it. I haven't had this app for more than a week so my rating may slide up or down by half a star but it's definitely a 4/5 from me",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,slappyrats,"I love this app, it syncs my texts from device to device flawlessly and the scheduling message feature is so amazing!!! But my password got changed and my account was deactivated when I bought the lifetime premium. I contacted the developer to get my account fixed but he never responded and I don't want to pay the price for it again even thought I love the app. It works great but there is no help if there's any issues which really sucks. Hey! It got resolved! The app remembers if you purchased it when you make a new account somehow. I would 100% recommend this beautiful app :)",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brad Barks,Great App. Seamlessly syncs texts between my phone and tablet. All texts that come to my phone show up on my tablet and texts sent from the tablet show up on the phone. The phone works the way it normally would. Like the feature that allows naming conversations.

Private conversations sometimes wont open, have to click back and forth between inbox and private box a few times.

After using this very well-designed app for a week I happily paid for a Lifetime Membership (it's only $10.99) for myself and for my wife. I did so because Pulse SMS offers features I have been wanting for a LONG time, such as: (1) The ""Repeat Alert"" option under ""Notification Customization"" in the ""Customization Settings"" area that can be set to remind you every minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or hour . . . that you have a text message you didn't notice and haven't read. (2) The ability to easily find any ""Unread conversations."" (3) A wealth of other no-charge features that make the app a clear winner. (4) And lastly, if you pay for a monthly, yearly, or lifetime subscription—the ability to install and use a slick desktop version on Windows, macOS, or Linux. The desktop app alone made it well worth the price of admission.",5

I love the options, the look and functionality. Thanks guys for making a product that I could easily see stands above the rest.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This is exactly what I was looking for. I am texting from my tablet and my computer. I can pay a one time fee to cover the cost of great features and not do a subscription. Little nuance characteristics that are really neat like coloring of individual text exchanges. Author responds quickly to questions. Great program.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"very happy to be able to text on my tablet. Emojis could be more consistant, but no big deal. I also like the fact that I can get an answer when I have a question. June 11, 2019. update: I don't understand why some of my text conversations show only the phone number, and others show only the name. It didn't do that initially. Very inconsistent.And today none of my texts are being received, even though it shows sent. I'm not receiving texts, either. when I send, it says""sending"" takes 4 minutes.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It is excellent. I love the fact that I can use it on all of my devices. I don't need to grab my phone to do a verification on my desktop. I had a glitch a couple of weeks ago where I could not send screenshots or media. I uninstalled and reinstalled and things now work fine. it's on my list of nearly perfect apps :),5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Edit : I have the paid subscription, and the notifications on my computer do not always show up, especially while my phone is turned off. Great messenger app, very sleek. However, crashes require I uninstall and reinstall, and I wish the colors saved for contacts added after the app is installed and that changed contact colors update the colors in groups.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've used this app for a few years. My favorite part about it is the web client. Recently, some of my messages never get delivered to my recipients, sometimes I receive messages, but a section of them disappear later, and finally the web client stopped sending, receiving, and syncing consistently for me months ago. I'll try to back up my messages offsite and delete them from Klinker, and see if I'm simply experiencing the upper limits of this app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"(1* just for attention, will update after this is addressed) within the last few updates, group texts are incredibly laggy. It takes a solid 4-5 seconds to send the message after hitting send. Normally, that wouldn't be an issue if it was done in the background, but it has been freezing my phone during the process.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I was enjoying using this app very much before It upgraded and stopped working. All of a sudden every time I wanted to send a text message, it refused and gave the error message that the text had failed to be sent. I switched back to another app and all the messages worked perfectly. It's too bad that we were not given a choice about whether or not we wanted to update the app that was working so well. I'm sorry to say goodbye to an app that I really liked. I did send feedback to the author.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Fricano,This is a fantastic text and SMS app that integrates well across browsers as well as phones and tablets. Back ups are included. The only frustrating thing about this app is the VERY clunky scheduling of future texts. Textra does it best but overall I like Pulse better in day to day use. If scheduling could be improved this would be an easy 5 Stars! Edit. The new update has dramatically improved the scheduling experience! Kudos! Thank you. Continues to be a great SMS experience.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jack Butler,"I think Pulse is one of the better SMS apps for Android. However there are a few drawbacks that really annoy me while using this app. I love the fact that is has the compatibility to run on pretty much all operating systems, but it doesn't work very well. Every time I send messages, it hangs. It is almost easier to just pick up my phone and do it from there. I really wish there was a fix for this and I have reached out to technical support about this before and was unable to find a solution.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app love it and it's the best messaging app I've come across yet. Although one thing I found irritating is that when I sent a message to my partner with important private info it didn't get sent. The numbers in the information ℹ entered and attempted to send were darkened out from the rest of the txt. Not sure what that's about. You could still see the numbers but they got blocked out for some reason.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall a decent app for text messaging. I like the fact there are no ads. Did go through a stretch where i wasnt receiving my text from anyone. Was able to send them but wasn't receiving them. My connection was good, no issues with phone service on that end. Spoke with my phone company thinking was on there end but came to the conclusion after investigating it was the app. Had to uninstall and then reinstall the app. After uninstalled everything has worked fine since. Overall a decent app though",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Draco7153,"I can honestly say after using this app for 3 years it is very much worth the money, super useful when you're on the computer and a great sms app overall. My only complaint is that when I save an number that I have a convo with, the convo tends to take a good while to start showing the name instead of just the number. Never hindered my experience, but frustrating when I save and go back. Awesome app nonetheless",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app, it just works. I've tried Android messages for the web several times, kept signing me out. Pulse has consistently worked for me, keeping me signed in on phone, home and work desktops as well as my tablet. The interface is simple but also customizable, finding a texting app that works well and lets me use my phone as well as multiple devices has been a fruitless quest until now. I've upgraded to the life membership.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Impressive overall, intuitive ease of use, and the cross platform support means everything to me for keeping in touch with friends and family, including quick access for emergencies. Thank you for this! I almost immediately purchased the lifetime app. My one request (please!) would be for the app to be available in the Amazon store for Kindle Fire.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,aTina Webb,"I love Pulse SMS. I use it on my phone and appreciate having access to it on my PC. Managing my texts, forwarding, copying, delayed send for those you realize you don't want to send, archiving, groups that I can name and on and on. The best feature and the reason I use Pulse rather than what came preloaded on my phone is the reminder notification that I have a text I have not read. I have contacted the developers a couple of times and they were responsive and helpful. Great app, thanks.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"As an alternate messaging system, it has the tendency to give the appearance of receiving random pics from random contacts. Even pics that were viewed but never saved to my phone. Even if the thread that contained that pic was previously deleted. How's does that even happen?? I then have to check my default messaging app to see what pic was actually sent. Fix this immediately. There is a glitch in the matrix.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mary Kennedy,Had another Messenger and it kept stopping. Looked for another and found Pulse. Yes!! So far so good! Been using off and on for almost 2 years. Still the best so far. Have some trouble with Group Texting which is paramount for me. People don't always get the text. However l still like it above others. Update: Looking for a great App... You found it. I absolutely love this App. Worked the glitches out of people receiving texts.. operator error. You can't send group texts back to back. Wait.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dotchi Latham,"I love this app. I can schedule text messages, put messages in folders, and make messages private so no one else can read them without a PIN. That's the major reasons I use the app. Plus, I can use text messages on the computer which comes in handy from time to time. Definitely worth the .99 I pay a month for that feature. I highly recommend this app",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far, I am quite pleased with this app, especially at 112 mg! This has the features I was used to with my previous longtime app. However, that one took up 3x the space! I was stuck mostly uninstalling, going back to the stock text program, then reinstalling. NO dark modes in this Android! Not even in developer options! I use an older 8g J2 Prime. Way less storage than my old Android 4g, bummer I lost that phone! (As long as I have an unrooted phone with removable battery!) This allows all the color adjustments, nice dark backgrounds for my eyes! Sends larger pics and videos. Plenty of customization options! So far, so nice!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Harlea Maria,"I really love this app, I feel like it's missing some things like being able to change background as color & picture, being able to add more then one in folder, change color on bubble only, have unknown folder, being able to send messages to people all at once without them being in a group. maybe more customize things. Other then that this app runs beautiful & I'm loving it a lot. I gave 4 stars because what I said I hope they get added in soon or make it more personal & customize to this app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love the ability to customize each contacts color! I used to use Android Messages for this option, but they took it away with their recent update. Pulse is easy to use, has a clean look, and offers a lot of other options that other text apps that I've tried lacked. Thanks for a great app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've misplaced/forgotten/broken my phone so many times this is a godsend! i can access the same messages any time from any device. I'm able to send an SMS on my laptop and it looks like it's coming from my cell. When i switch over phones i don't lose my whole message history - I just download the app and it's like nothing changed. Titally worth the one-time fee for lifetime subscription, which is what I did.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,M R,"I downloaded this because I could not get out of a group chat, and muting the conversation in other apps didn't keep it from appearing in my text list. Pulse was the perfect solution!!!! Easy to use, clean appearance, and the private folder was the perfect place for the aforementioned group chat! Super happy!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"everything about the app is great, except one thing. when it comes to text messages even though I'd receive the notification, when I open up the app I sometimes don't see the actual text sent to me. which is weird. so I'd see it somewhat in the conversation list, then I'd have to guess what they said when its time for me to respond.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rita Baudo,"Bad!. Synced well. Worked really well until this week. Then it stopped working. It was taking 4 hours for someone to get my text and some never got it at all. No place to contact anyone at pulse. Tried to uninstall, then reinstall. Other things. Nothing work. Really frustrating! If you are reading this, pulse , would love to know how to reach you and get some help!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app, only one that I have found that you can drag a picture into and click send, also can mark unread after reading and much more. 2 things, I can't seem to get the lifetime to do anything once selected, it just goes away and is like to see a choice to send group messages as group or individually please, but still the best app that is usable at a computer also",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The tablet application puts conversations that are private on the phone back into the regular list on a daily basis. It is only on the tablet that way. But still It allows anyone with my tablet to read those conversations. It also is difficult editing a scheduled text as the top part of the conversation is full size and ur keyboard stays full size.. Leaving a very small window to see what you're editing,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Swann,"Really love this app. I love the scheduled message feature. Wish it was just a little more advanced, though. For example, it would be really valuable if I could set it to repeating weeks and then go in and modify specific scheduled texts without messing with all of them.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Doug Ward,"After three requests to tech support with no response, I believe I have to give up. When installing on my tablet, I get a message saying I already have a primary device, do I want to replace it with this one. Seems like the answer is No since the primary device should be a phone and not a tablet. This also seems like a simple fix from tech support. I have tried options under the 'Danger Zone' by refreshing and also deleting and recreating the account. Perhaps there is no response because I wanted to confirm there was nearly an 80% price increase in the last few months and I questioned the cost. I really wanted this to work so as to be able to text rom a phone and tablet.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Snack,"I noticed that sometimes when I would send MMS the person I was sending it to would never receive it. I switched messaging apps on a whim, and all the stuck messages that failed to send before were sent out. People were flooded with hundreds of pictures from over the years. I do NOT recommend this product.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan “Sketch” G,"This app has quite a few features and functions that I find to be either helpful or fun, however the app gets locked up when trying to open a link/website in some texts. Its also no very easy to mute texts from and individual or group. There are a few steps when their should just be one. Otherwise, I solid alternative to messages or message+",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,"George Maxwell, DC","I like the app and the options it has for customization. It is a little slower than other similar apps, most notably when opening the app and sometimes when switching between areas in the app. It also occasionally freezes for 5 or more seconds. I've tried the app on various phones and Android builds with similar results.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It works great! However, I do not like the fact that you have to pay a dollar a month to be able to do your messaging on your computer as well! The Google Android messaging app does the same exact thing for free! However, that app crashes on my phone constantly that's the only reason I even downloaded this one!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is ok, I think textra is significantly better. It has so many more options for customization. The textra quick reply screen shows you much more compared to pulse, marks your message as read, and dissmisses the notification. The pulse quick reply gives the same experience as Hangouts. Keeps the notifications intact after you respond, forcing you to swipe it away after hitting send.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Decent messaging app.  However, I lost a conversation with no way of recovering.  Unfortunately, it was a conversation I wanted keep that had almost 2 years worth of discussions.  It just disappeared after tapping the notification to go into the app.  no swipe to delete since you have a chance to undo that.  I had no chance to undo it and therefore lost numerous important conversations.  I paid for the app to get the backup feature but what I failed to realize is there is no point and time recovery for that.  Its realtime, along with the message removals.with no way of recovery.  That's not really a backup and should not be called backup.  Calling it message backup implies that you can recover which you Can't.  This feature should be called sync since that is it's only purpose.  To sync the current status to any device you are logged into.     UPDATE: Hence why I said ""I failed to realize that there was no point in time recovery"".  My main issue was the fact that deleting messages give you the undo button, but due to a bug I lost 2 years of a conversation with no option to undo or recover that conversation all from simply opening the app via tapping the notification",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It's ok but a little clunky. I don't like that it sends emojis right when you click on them. It also often has a delay. It says it is still sending on my end but the other person has already received the message and replied. I only use this app because it's the only way to connect text messaging to my Samsung smart watch with my Pixel phone. Otherwise I don't think it's worth the money.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Scott Bennett,"Really good app with a lot to offer. Scheduling messages for different times is really nice since I work graveyards. I almost gave it 4 stars because the UI is pretty bland, but as far as offering a lot of user-friendly functions, it's far and away one of the best messaging apps it there. If they could just offer a little more graphics on the UI side, it works be perfect.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Peggy Herdlicka,I do like this app it has great emojis. I also like that I can put the text messages in folders and invorder of importance. Would recommend. *update* not as happy with app as before. I had to get a new phone and completely changed the format. I'm trying to see if I can fix it so I'm leaving the star rating as is...for now. Fingers crossed.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Soar -,"Deleting SMS or MMS in Pulse SMS app does not actually delete the message on the device. That's a big bug that makes the app almost useless. Also, it started nagging to buy a subscription. If it does that again, it gets uninstalled and added to my online list of nagware. UPDATE: I'm surprised by the response. This is a known bug that was reported OVER 2 YEARS AGO. The previous developer, Klinker, chose not to fix it, so the bug still exists. Please read your own bug report site for all details.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Walt Tramontana,"It doesn't even auto block spam texts, and their website said it was free, yet as soon as you open it they try to lead you to 'purchase' ... I don't do bait and switch. If you have additional services to offer, great, but let your used click on the feature and then offer a purchase. I don't like pushy marketing and now I don't trust your app having access to my messages either. Uninstalled.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Thompson,"Great App but doesn't work with Android Auto. I've used Textra for years and I got a new phone so I looked for a new SMS app. I found Pulse and love it's features. Message backup and messages appearing on other devices or computers is great. The down fall of this app is you can't use it with Android Auto. AA will receive messages but when you ask to play the text message, AA will tell this app is not supported. Maybe in a future update Android Auto will be supported.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kimberley Morris,"THE Best sms App! Works across all my devices, but isn't Wifi dependent. Sends from my phone on 2g as well. Group texts work well with people on iPhones, which Android texting would not do for me. I love that I can send texts whatever device I'm using. I don't generally keep my phone in my room at night, so it's great that I can see on my tablet if my kids are texting me. I've not had any of the issues I've seen in other reviews, except the keyboard in landscape mode is awkward.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great cross platform text messaging app. It could use some more features for contacts. The app should sync contacts more than once per day, have options for how often. (time intervals or everytime a new contact) It should be able to add new contacts on any platform and have them sync to phone. (new contact from email and want to text them via web/windows? You must first add them on your phone then resync)",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Golova Phone,"So. I like it. But it does things awekwardly. For example, scheduling sms takes too many clicks, the saved sms is located in a weird folder and does not appear in chat history. Thescheduling button is hidden too many clicks away. Why not make Swipe action call a contacts. New SMS also takes too many clicks. When you write something and forget to send and come back to that chat in a week and delete whatever was not sent - the chat goes up the filter. No way to Lock a selected blurp.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Edit: Had to lower my rating. After a few months, I finally had to uninstall and suffer with stock app. The uninstall triggered ALL of the unsent texts to push through the stock app, over 50+ texts resent to contacts. Awful! 11/11/19: When I first started app was great! Now, my MMS messages aren't being sent or received, group texts are spotty, I know the system is receiving the images because I can see the file in the stock messaging app. I've searched and searched with absolutely no solution.",2

The app is very customizable. I finally found the app I was looking for!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have the 11 dollar version and it's great! I love the customization and the texting from anywhere (which is far superior to Google's implementation since I don't have to set it up randomly/every 30 days). I love the light weight programming: when my S7 was getting older, the Google messages app would take a minute to load, this app did not have that problem. Even the free version is better than most messaging apps. Excited for rcs implementation.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gloria Smith,So far it is working great. I appreciate no ads. 11/5/20...I guess I spoke too soon. Now the app does not notify me with sound and notification dot. My phone only vibrates. I have went through the steps to set it. I was having problems with my old message app and this was the reason for getting a different one. Now I have the same problem. It is so annoying when you have to keep checking for messages. Helpppppp!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse app works great across Android devices. Its support for OS wear allowed me to connect my TicWatch Pro. Multi-number support lets me text from mobile number and Google Voice number. The compose text feature was not intuitive enough for my 9 year old to send a message on my behalf. Will be interested to learn more about archiving and accessing the archive. Happy to have the app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Norfrey,"I've been using this for a couple of years now, got the lifetime subscription, and am very happy with it as opposed to the built-in message apps from individual phone carriers. I needed something that would also be available on my work computer screen so that I could answer work-related texts throughout the day. Notifications come up on the phone and computer screen, so it's easy to keep up with any communication. All in all, this app has been just what I needed!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jose Pico,"This app works great, all the time. It is very easy and reliable. I tried Tablet Talk but found it to be awkward and difficult to set up.

The visuals are similar: a simple color scheme which you may edit via hexadecimal and apply individually or univerally. The premium access allows you to sync with applets for Win, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Chrome browser, Firefox, Android tablets, and online. I find both functions vastly superior to the native Google Messenger equivalents in terms of functionality and reliability. The developer also has remarkable detail in the help section.",5

It is easy to use and minimizes the needless waste of time in replying to or deleting messages quickly. Its notification tab is very useful and a time saver. The only negative, which has nothing to do with the app, is that the developer seems to be a little curt in his replies to others' reviews, which makes me a little weary. Maybe a PR person would be helpful from a customer retention aspect.",5

It works really seamlessly on all those devices.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Solved my issue of having one phone number for all text messages. Better than ANY SMS forwarder on the market! I sent a text to my friend from my work phone, and he saw it came from my personal number, and he immediately asked: ""How did you do that?"" Knowing the messages are fully encrypted makes me very comfortable using this app. Considering this is a one person development operation I am amazed at the quality of this app. I am not knocking it for this but your primary phone has to be on for the app to work and I understand why. I think people should be aware of that. I bumped this from 4to 5 stars based on super fast response and learning everything I need was there! Here is what I asked about Whyly four stars? 1. I would love to see partial text copy (maybe I am missing something). 2. Every number in a text I click on only gives me an option to call the number. For example, if I get a pin for multi-factor authentication, I would love to be able to copy it and not just call it. Those two items listed above no way drive me away from using this application.",4

It lets you theme the whole app, individual converstations, it has always worked with no hitches even when my phone is off. Well worth the price. The only reason that I am not giving it five stars is there is no button to pull up emoji's when using a physical keyboard on a tablet. On a phone its right along the top of the keyboard and it looks different than the samsung texting app or textra like I used before so I know its programed into the app. If I shut off my keyboard the tablet looks just like the phone but when I connect its keyboard theres no way to get to the emojii keyboard. Fix it and I will update it to 5 stars hands down.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Best SMS app! Could it be possible to add an easy way to type special characters like ""ñ"" or ""é"" on the web app? I've seen native apps like MS Outlook implement this, for example, for ""é"" you'll press CTRL + ' then the letter ""e"" in your keyboard. Mozilla Thunderbird has an add on called Zombie Keys that adds this type of functionality as well. This kind of feature would make Pulse just perfect for me.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Industrial Lightworks,"Ok so I switched from Textra to pulse and I absolutely love it! Textra didn't have a search option which I truly needed. Also there was some glitch that didn't allow the big emojis to work and I really liked those. Pulse is easy, super customizable, from personal notifications and sounds to special colors of bubbles for each person! I also name all my groups and give them their own notification tone so I don't have to check my phone to know who is texting me. I love it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,chris keller,"Well, I really liked this, for about a week. Then it stopped working on my laptop. Every time I try to log in now, I get a security message saying: ""You cannot visit pulsesms.app right now because the website uses HSTS"" Whatever the hell that means. I sent two emails to support and have heard nothing. I tried a couple of fixes through web search and they didn't work either. Too bad, I really liked it when it worked. Still works on my phone, but I need the same SMS on both devices, so I have to uninstall that now. Bummer.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christopher Anderson,"I liked the app better in the beginning. Now, sending and receiving photos is next to impossible and receiving can be unstable. It's disappointing how this app is failing now. I'm missing texts from family and friends, photos are not being sent, it's going out. Time to look elsewhere, I have it a shot.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jevonia Martin,"I do like this app but I've noticed that multimedia messages do not come through if the data isn't on so if someone randomly sends a picture to you for example, you'll never know since it doesn't show up at all. As small as this may be, it makes me want to switch to a different app that at least acknowledges there's a multimedia message waiting to be downloaded. Please review & rectify this & I will update my review up to 5 Stars.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tessa Gilmore,"Used this app for months, loved it. Woke up one morning, all of the sudden was recieving no notifis. No vibe, noise, or banner. Only way to see new SMSs is if I opened a convo. Still got notifs from all other apps including other sms apps if I switched the default. I don't know what happened, phone didn't update during the night, no setting anywhere was impeding notifications. Tried restarting the phone, the app, cache clear, reinstalling, switching default SMS. Nothing, unfortunately unusable.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tim Shaw,"Love the app but just missing 1 silly little thing. A way to enable a badge showing how many people each text was sent too. This is texting 101 guys and makes it so I cannot even consider your, otherwise, awesome app! Would be 5 stars but for that simple, yet important option. Knocked off another star, seeing a list of thumbs up replies from a group I sent to, with no way to HAVE A NAME Next to them makes your app absolutely of no use to me. A real shame… I really wanted to use your app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Close to 5-star. Feature-rich, customizable, assign specific colors to people, text from computer, scheduled texts, backup & restore, more. The -1star problems: usability related, too hard to see phone numbers for people, impossibly bad for group texts, save images/media clunky, no persistent left column for conversation list-- far too much backing out of existing conversation, folder implementation good on phone app but terrible on desktop. Missing features: create or select video message",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Awesome texting app, love that it works on any platform, can get my text messages even on my linux computer. I bought the lifetime subscription and am glad I did. The only feature I feel it lacks is a driving mode that could auto reply with a message. Would be nice if you could turn that on and off manually and also set certain Bluetooth devices to use it automatically.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I left the stock android messaging app because I craved more customization. Pulse gives me infinitely more control. Changes are made at the contact level, so each conversion can be personalized (which is crazy helpful if you have multiple contacts with the same name and you only give a cursory glance at who you're talking to). A great app!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Josh Anthony,"I will change this to a higher rating once they fix whatever is causing media messages to be very unreliable. They send, but only occasionally. It says sent on my end, but the other person never recieved it. Great app overall, but this problem is making it hard to use.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Installed, set up account and began using as my default sms app. Instant issues with phone locking up. Tried reinstalling, refreshing account, everything I could find in the help documentation, but nothing worked. After restarting phone, it would work for a few minutes then lock it up. Biggest issue is it starting causing the phone to show no SIM cards, only way to get back on the network was to reboot again. Good looking app, but I think there are still bugs to work out. Running a new phone with stock Android version and memory is not an issue. Be that as it may, will not run on my stock android phone, unless the developer has another suggestion.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It has been smooth and seemless between my phone and computer. Very nice way to backup messages! The only issue is there is no way to export your messages to use with any other app. All messages can only be viewed and managed through their app and interface tools online.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,TC Gompf,Excellent all around. Also good on Windows PC. Edit: essentially looks horrible on the big screen of a Samsung Galaxy Zfold-3 even now five or six months after the phone is released. I've tried to go back to it because I liked it a lot in the past but until they make it look good on a big screen... forget it.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Greg Balint,"I've loved using this app for years now, however there was an issue that came up (resolved now) where their website and desktop app became unreachable and non-functioning. Still a great app, but might need to think about your needs and the fact that this is cloud based for the multiple device functionality. Would be great if they offered a self-hosted option.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mary O'Rourke Sullivan,Works very well! I do a lot of group texting on my Samsung and unfortunately the preinstalled message app split those reply text into separate conversations. Very confusing. Pulse enables the replies to remain in the original stream and for that reason alone I give it the highest rating. Easy to use and does what I need it to do.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Devon Black,"Update: I might have flown off the handle when they were down, coincidentally at the same time I was forced to update, which made it seem worse than it was. They have acknowledged a number of the issues and fixed the technical ones, I didn't see those announcements before. Restored to 5 stars. (still researching privacy situation) Update: some shady company called maple media now owns this. RUN AWAY! bad security certs, probably other issues. Current desktop app is not working, maybe because of the bad certs. Existing user credentials no longer working so you can't even open a ticket or sign in. Maple has bad reputation for stealing personal data anyway, so skip it! --------- Very few problems works as described. I can't function without it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frederick Brown,"Reliability waning. Unfortunately, I cant depend on this app anymore, particularly for MMS texts. My app shows a message, sent with a pic attachment, but the recipients say no attachments. True for single recipient or multiple recipients. Very logical/easy to use app, unfortunately, I cant rely on it anymore. CN nolonger recommend. June 13 Reponse to Pulse Reply. In response to your suggestion to reach out to Pulse support, I already had , and none of their recommendations solved the issue",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Like it but with issues. Composing a text from notification, or scheduling a text the composition screen is a scaled down pop up. Should not be the case. Composing and selecting Groups takes foreveeeeeer to load, same with all contacts. Need to have a tab for starred contacts in addition to Recents. Good overall. Fix the above and great!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Moore,Best thing about Pulse for me is seamless and fast integration of contacts on the web interface. I start to type a name from my contacts and it immediately appears. Much faster than the competition. I also like the clean phone app design. I ding one star because sometimes logging in and resetting passwords can be a pain.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrew Mierzwiak,"This had been my trusted messenger for the last few years, but I've been just running into too many issues sending/receiving images and videos (just missing entirely from group threads). I found when switching to the native messenger people started getting media I sent, and I started receiving them again. Should that get ironed out in the future I'd switch back in a heartbeat.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tammie Shea,"Update: I have contacted by email several times now. Do we want to have this conversation here? I think it would be better if you used the contact info I provided via email to resolve this? I've had several ""we've done some updates... try again messages."" What are the updates? What is the problem you're trying to fix? I hate feeling like it's me, not you, but actually think it's you, not me. Original Message: I have been a happy Pulse lifetime subscriber for years. Unfortunately, over the past few weeks something has happened with the service and it is completely unreliable. Texts sent through the web app in Firefox take up to 27 minutes to be sent or received. This is beyond disappointing, and I will be moving on.Giving two stars because when it worked, it was great. I hope whoever has it now (no longer Klinker) will work out the issues.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Murphy,I have love hate relationship with the app. I use it for multi platform support but it has weird quirks. It says I have a new msg when I send a link to someone. It can't handle drag and drop in windows for links. It's poor at synching between platforms even when I got the manual synch button. If I read on windows it won't mark as read until I read on phone sometimes. Ant seem to start minimized in win. I get lots of duplicate text issues I didn't get with default android. Needs more polishing,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,jorge moreno,"Good app, needs improvements and more extensions. Scheduling of messages needs much improvement. Synchronization process, Group management, contact information should include more extensions for notes or other apps that support notes and email integration, Android and PC versions.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like the ability to custom color each conversation. I like being able to pick contacts to the top. I would like to be able to lock specific messages to prevent accidental deletion. I'm still testing out the ability to text from my computer and tablet and will probably purchased the lifetime upgrade.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick & Lana Schweitzer,Has worked flawlessly and is deserving 5 stars. That said I wish there were a tier that adds bidirectional support. Meaning the ability to use either number to text from. EDIT: I've dropped 1 star for losing all my texts. It said my password was wrong and wouldn't pull it back down. I appreciate the 0 knowledge stance but at least give me an local export of I want it. I could've saved all my data before wiping the account and starting over. Still love the function but would love added features.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app! It is so much more comprehensive than your standard messages app. I've worked with Samsung to Apple, and this app keeps me connected to everything. I'm a business owner so following up with clients is really important and I'm able to schedule messages for specific date or time. It's like another virtual assistant! Bonus: I can archive threads and recall them later! Extra Bonus: I can do all of this on my desktop tablet and phone. Occasionally I like to send gifs and this app actually lets me send gifs via text. If you are not using an app like this one (especially as a business owner) then you're wasting your time!!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,PJ Barta,"App works well with my Galaxy 7. Only wish the app would allow me to lock specific messages in a conversation so they don't get deleted. Also, would like it if when I set a notification tone to a specific contact it would stay set without having to keep the conversation in my local site. It just seems when I delete a conversation the settings I placed on that contact are set back to default settings. Otherwise, not a bad app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love the layout and the color/notification sound features. However, I don't get notified of about half the texts I receive. No sound, vibration, or pop up. Not even a little number on the app. I don't notice if I get texts until I check the app hours later.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Edit: originally had it at four stars because I was unaware of the multi select option to delete multiple messages at a time. The developer contacted me and informed me how to do this. I want to preface this review by saying that I've tried several different SMS computer apps, and I've found Pulse to be the most consistently satisfying option, and the compatibility of Pulse along with the reasonable premium price is the reason why I've chosen this one.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lord Xanthor (Lord-Xanthor),"Pulse SMS text application is well worth the life time fee! It uses your existing cell phone number, and not just allows one to read their messages, but also write them from any device, with no lag, no delays, and no skipped messages, as long as you have a good signal! Whether android device, Windows PC, or any device with browser, you can read write messages from any of them instantly! Old phone can't use the app? Just log in via browser and send your messages. It can even import contacts!",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"App works alright. Latest update broke 'enter to send' on my Pixelbook pretty much making it useless to use the app. Web client is far too clunky and annoying. May have to look into switching back to stock. I've tried modifying keyboard settings (Default Keyboard, Display an Enter/Return Key, Display a Send Key) as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the app, even gone as far as powerwashing my Chromebook and nothing is restoring the functionality of sending messages by hitting enter.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bat-Sheva,I really enjoy this messaging app. The messaging via web interface is so useful. I like how I can assign a color to each contact and see that color displayed in the icon on my Always On Display- so I can guess who has messaged me before even seeing the message. I love the schedule-send feature. The developer was quick to respond when I noticed a bug. Very happy overall.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian Pilling,"Still great and gets better with every update. 06/21/2021. I've used many texting apps and this one works for me the best, by far, over any of the others. I've used the free and paid version and they both work great, but the paid version is definitely worth the money if you will text from a computer, send future scheduled messages, and more. Even has a great web app for use on Apple devices.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,M G,"Does not send bulk text messages reliably (I send scripture texts daily), much less consistently. I'm considering alternative apps.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark Weissinger,"Difficult to sync and login. I loggedin with a reliable password and after it was installed, the next time I logged in it wouldnt allow it, saying my password was not valid. The only way that they said I could reboot was to uninstall the app and start over! When I did it would not allow me to change my password or login with my original. It also would not upgrade even after I purchased it. Lastly, there is no apparent way to delete messages. Swiping in both directions just archives the messages",1

One prob: can't make the sound go away that occurs when I tap send. The touch/tap sound is turned off in my gen'l settings for apps for my Samsung Galaxy android phone.

Edit- thank you Maple for the reply, I'll reach out though the app logs and anything else. Edit 2 - worked with support with a better understanding of the software and connection between different platforms, sometimes an issue with google play services on the primary mobile device with the active SMS account needs a bump, a simple reboot of the phone otherwise possible resetting Pulse Password and signing in all over again. This could be due to Google Play services issues. I'll continue use Pulse as I have for years, hopefully RCS is in the future",5

Started on my Nexus 6P and has continued with Note 9 No problems with other apps.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Orlando -,"Worked great for 2-3 years but in the last 3 months I've been having a slew of SMS problems. I could always send SMS but receiving them was sporadic. I contacted my carrier, reset network settings, uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times, deleted and recreated my pulse account but nothing fixed this problem. I then switched SMS apps and my problems stopped. I'm very disappointed because I loved this app and used it on my phone, watch and google chrome but something changed.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Petryuk,"App UX seems pretty good and the sync to desktop is great. However after installing, the app crashes every few minutes or so. It may be due to the amount of messages it tried to download since I have messages going back up to 10 years. Unfortunately will have to switch to a different app till I find a fix",2

This program is so good that when I type a message on my PC (it has real keys) I can watch it appear on my tablet and phone at same time. Talk about synched!!!! I am 78 and need things to run smoothly. Well worth the tiny annual cost. Addendum:. Vs 5.2.3.2731 very unstable. Locks up, requires restart of app. Phone and computer well synched but tablet is not.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Been using Pulse for quite a few months now, not sure how long but it has been great. I really can't think of any times where I thought it wasn't worth the lifetime membership. I will use this service until I can't, because it's just that good.  Also, there is something to be said about being able to reply without switching devices. Keyboard to phone back to keyboard gets old, but this app makes texting much less of a chore. I find I am much better and keeping contact with this app, my family thanks you.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Lifetime subscriber from the early days but had to uninstall. Was rock solid for years, but suddenly back in October I noticed I wasn't receiving quite a few MMSs despite no changes on my end. Enough that I was completely missing events with friends and family, and conversations were making zero sense. Tried all the mms fixes outlined in help, then eventually contacted support.... Zero response. Boo. Switched to Google messages, and many of the missing mms were there!",2

App used to work really great and I love its customizability, but for the last 6 months or so it sometimes doesn't send or receive texts, both group and individual, SMS or MMS, with or without attachments or copied & pasted URLs. I see from other recent reviews that sending and receiving issues seem to be more common now. Hope the developer fixes it soon.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Randy Nguyen,Finally. Took long enough for me to find an SMS app with a working widget to see texts on the phone home screen. It's unbelievable how so many others don't bother with such a small feature. Pulse is pleasant to look at and was customizable. It imported my years old text messages just fine and had no timestamp glitches of any sort.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's a nice alternative to the stock Samsung messaging app, but I haven't seen any notable advantages so far, except perhaps for the option to select different color themes for each contact. Update 2/21/20: Got a new phone, OnePlus 7 Pro w/ Android 10. Didn't much like messaging app. Pulse looks & works better. Personally, I liked Samsung's showing the photo ID's next to each text balloon so I was always sure who I was texting. If Pulse adds that as an option, I'd give the app 5 stars.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The best texting app in my opinion! I am a manager where I work and we text A LOT. It is so helpful to be able to text on the computer (I'm a one finger texter on my phone). I am much faster on a computer keyboard. I have tried other similar apps but, you had to be sinced with your phone at all times in order to use it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"fairly similar to the stock messages app (which I like), but with more powerful functionality! the only two features I do not like as much are: 1) Attachments to messages are not as aesthetically smooth, and you cannot share your LIVE location- just current. 2) Photos of people you are texting do not appear in the thread.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Was having issues with my stock SMS app not downloading MMS group messages or pictures, and opening to different conversations than most recent new texts.

Except for one thing - for being such a customizable messaging app, I wish there was an option for tablets to have a ""preview message"" feature, where the list of contacts is to the left and the open conversation is to the right. Otherwise, it's truly amazing!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,R Google,"Pretty good app. Lots of customization. I uninstalled, however, even after paying. My main objective was seeing texts on multiple devices, to use tablet instead of phone to read and type texts when home - which doesn't always work in Pulse. Apparently the Android features for enhanced chat (including text over wifi) is still proprietary so unavailable to Pulse as 3rd party. Turned out, Google Messages can achieve what I need, just had to install on tablet and ""pair"" with phone on home wifi.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Strong Lady,"Pulse SMS is much better than the standard Samsung Message app. I like the layout a lot better. The main reason I got it is so I could ""text"" from my desktop, and that is very, very handy for me many times. (I type 70wpm on a desktop, but I make many errors on a tiny phone keyboard!) It's also easier to attach a photo that's on my desktop rather than having to send it to my phone then attach it. U P D A T E -- Dec. 12, 2021 -- For the past two days, I cannot connect via Pulse SMS on my pc. It is blocked as dangerous because of and invalid certificate, or something. I used the pc version daily, so I'm really missing it. Because the dangerous aspect of it concerned me, I even switched back to the Samsung Text App on my Android devices too. Please tell me if this is to be corrected and when.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,VAN B,App has been good so far. I installed it because the texting app (textra) which I have on my phone is not compatible with my tablet (shames).

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love the app and it's ability to span across devices. It's so much smoother and more subtle than microsoft's version and not as glitchy as android messages. One thing that would be great would be the ability to adjust the day/night mode times like you can on Mood. Apart from that this is a great SMS app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tripp Stanford,"I may have missed it, but I didn't see in the description that this app does not support RCS texting. My carrier switched over to RCS and this app will only support SMS and MMS. After loading the app, I was unable to receive messages from my contacts unless they each, individually, went into their message settings and switched to ""send this contact SMS and MMS only."" That is just not reasonable. Maybe if this app gets RCS support, then I'll download again. I would also advise trying out the free trial first. I paid the up front fee for lifetime, thinking it would just work. Now I am waiting on a refund.",1

In the midst of conversation it sporadically fails to update/refresh when the other party sends a sms, moreso when the response is prompt.

xyz.klinker.messenger,f hackney,"8/2020 - Developer was very responsive and app seemed to work very well. I'm not sure why, but, the Wear OS component was not available to me from the Play Store and this was the driver for me in using this app. Once this component becomes available, I would certainly try the app again. 4 stars 12/2020 - Finally able to download Wear OS app, but, couldn't delete messages from the watch app. Not good.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Doug Linder,"I would give this app 4.5 or 5 stars if it weren't for one thing: it's unreliable as hell in terms of actual message delivery. It's not buggy, the interface and features are pretty good, and when it works, it works well. But when you press the ""send"" button, it's a crapshoot. About 50% of the time the messages go right through nearly instantly just like regular SMS. About 30% of the time, they arrive maybe in a minute or two. About 15% of the time they take forever, like 10-20 minutes,. And about 5% of the time they just don't show up at all. I don't know why this is - it's not my devices, it's not internet traffic, it seems completely random. But I'm probably going to cancel my subscription soon since despite it being great in every other way, if it can't reliably do its basic job of RELIABLY delivering messages in a timely manner, it's useless. I would never use it for any message that was critical, which is kind of sad. And I'm really tired of hearing people say ""I didn't get that message yet"" ten minutes after I sent it, or ""I never got that message at all."". I didn't find anything about this in the help page, and the page to submit a request is not working.",2

There are probably easy answers but for some reason I keep going in circles. I will be purchasing this app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ashley Lovell,"I paid for the lifetime subscription for this app thinking it had exactly what I needed. From the beginning I've had difficulty sending and receiving texts and especially within groups.

There is no help from this app designer. I'm done with it.",1

I've had a lot of messages never go through, and a lot of important messages never getting to me at all. People have asked me why I didn't respond to their texts, it's because this program just doesn't work all of the time. I must've had 20 times where it would screw up, causing me to restart the application after shutting it down. The worst part, is that there is no way to get a refund from Google Play. I paid for a lifetime access and this is the message from Google Play...

I originally mentioned in addition its not working over wifi, but now understand thats not a feature,, but my complaint about messages being lost is still an issue. I went for a week not hearing from some folks only to find out that they were messaging me repeatedly while I was receiving some texts from others, it seems when alerts come through, they won't go to Pulse, but to the Sprint factory installed text app and then if I check that app then it asks me if I want to switch to that app as default. And I usually say no, but if I want to see the alert message I have to say yes and then change my default back to Pulse afterwards cause Sprint won't let me see the alert messages otherwise. And I think that causes gaps where text messages fall through a void of sorts, neither messaging app getting them. Is there anyway for Pulse to receive Amber Alerts and emergency messages so they stop going to the factory installed Sprint app (which I can't delete)? I've already paid for a years worth of service and I'm pretty bummed about loosing messages and feeling really uncomfortable about communication via text, sigh.

Also would like to see an option to import ALL messages in the thread rather than just 50, I understand that this however is a technical limitation but it would be cool to see. Also the developer provides unparalleled support even though it's a one man team, which is absolutely amazing. Great app overall.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very good app. It would be better if there was a shortcut access to private messages. When selecting the notification for a private message, it doesn't go to the unlock dialog. This creates a situation for us to have to manually open the private chat section. Taking away time and extra effort. Please look into it. Also.. sending multiple messages at rapidly causes messages to remain unsend for some time. Edit: 1. It would really be helpful if on selection of the notification it would directly take me to the private conversation tab. 2. I used to use another 3rd party app for messaging and it delivered all my messages in order. Now I am having issues where certain messages gets delayed and some gets send instantly. I am very happy about your Swift response. It would really mean a lot to me if u could solve the first problem at the least. Thank you 😁 EDIT: My problems have been solved. Thanks for looking into it.. 💟",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall very nice app, but I had to disable the swipe right or left feature as it is extremely sensitive on my S9 Plus. I accidentally deleted a couple of messages, but took quick advantage of the undo feature which is awesome. While the swipe feature has some customization options, it would be great if you could add the option to swipe to call. One thing I like about android messages - It would be great if you could add it here - is while looking at your conversation list you can simply click on the individuals avatar, and it opens the contact details for that person. It's a nice feature, and yes I know you can do that within the actual conversation.   The conversation list is separated by headers (today, yesterday, last week...)  which is cool, but at times I wish I had the ability to disable the headers. Overall I'm really liking this app.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really like this app, the interface looks great, better than any of the competition in my opinion, but... notification dots don't show on my phone.

I've been very pleased with Pulse. the functionality is almost identical and I prefer the Pulse look and feel. the only future it doesn't appear to have is uploading images, but that feature was redundant since Amazon photo was doing the same thing.

There are fixes for all of the problems I have found, but it can still get frustrating.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Lots of options and personnalization, plus backup. Thank you for taking the time to make a great app. It's worth paying for it. If you were looking to make it even better here is an idea: allow users to enter details about their mobile phone plan (from where to where they can text for free or for a fee) then according to current location, have the app automatically notify the user he is going to be charged roaming/international fee. I think this has never been done so you could be first",5

There seems to be an issue when I'm receiving a video from someone else that if I try to send them messages before I received their video (and I don't know that Pulse is receiving the video via MMS), then my messages will hang at ""Sending"". Then after I receive the video from the contact, my messages will proceed to send as normal. The Windows app also randomly had javascript errors one morning and wouldn't open properly anymore.

Another feature I'd like is to have a view that which only shows conversations that have not yet been put in a folder, and the ability to make it the default view. Another thing would be regardarding some sort of red dot to indicate that a folder has unseen or unread messages. So, main=unassigned, other folders as they're assigned.",5

Now using the Your Phone app from Microsoft which has less features, but it actually works. contacted the developer to ask for my money back, but no luck. If it actually worked consistently it would be a 5 star app",2

Overall the app is much better than the Android messaging app and would recommend.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Definitely like their cross-platform feature and one-time fee to get it after the free trial (which I much prefer over monthly subscription)! Only a few issues: have to scroll to top to see new messages when you open the app??!

Still one of the better apps out there for sure.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I am mostly satisfied with this app. I do miss some features that Textra has. The message composition for scheduled texts is too basic and doesn't allow photos or attachments. and composing from the computer app you can't select from a contacts list - you have to start typing the right contact name for it to generate, but you might be out of luck if you can't remember the exact spelling. BUT, all this I can handle and doesn't keep me from choosing this app and paying for lifetime premium, and I am very picky. The best feature I like is the ability to group messages and comversations into folders and categorize them. This is the most helpful feature and I wish Textra had this! Even better would be if we could flag messages for further follow-up upon opening or mark them as unreplied on the main message list somehow.",4

One, It's not always clear when a message needs to be sent as MMS, requiring mobile data.

Given I only send a text once or twice a week, I have gone back to the default app on my phone. Edited to add: The developer says it is still free however every time I opened it, it was prompting me to create an account, and there seemed to be no way to get rid of that message and actually send a text. Now it's no longer the default messaging app, the message is no longer appearing. As my usage is so low, I'll be sticking with the simpler default app for now.",2

Only issue is occasionally my phone's original message system will intercept texts before pulse and will request to be returned as the default message app. This occurs at boot during a delay to activate. Possibly caused by Android updated permission system and not a pulse bug as earlier versions did not have this issue. Worth supporting with paid version.,4

It looks really out of place ever since the Android 12 update though and the dynamic keyboard theme.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Fantastic app. Highly recommend the paid version. Downloaded it to use while overseas, so I can leave my SIM at home diverted to a travel sim, and receive my SMS and respond as if it were coming from my normal number, using the web interface. Only way to make it better would be to have a toggle in the app, to change from actual to virtual connection, so I could use the app while overseas instead of the web interface, because then I could get notifications! Please consider this for next version!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Initially gave it one star (forced to rate the app before reading an important text) but, Yes, I think it's basically a great app. One glitch on my installation: if a new text arrives while the conversation's still open, I can't mute the notification sound. Annoying. Update : quick response to my initial niggles from app team. Thanks guys.",5

What it does do though is, if the phone blanks while you're composing a message, when you wake it up you are quite likely to find that some or most of what you've just carefully typed in has disappeared without a trace.

Also, when I log into the web app with my creds, it also doesn't seem to recognize anything past the date my phone died. Good thing that my phone backup kept everything. Was 5 star until this happened. Can this be fixed? Update: A week later. things suddenly sync'd. I lost those post-death messages, but it works again. So ... I'm ok with it. Stuff happens.",5

Contrary to response to that review, there is NO way of getting rid of the box. Only way is to come onto Play Store and click 'open'.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Tarryl Hart,"Changing my initial review. I used to love this app. Now I'm constantly getting notifications to create an account and despite what the canned response developer says in other reviews and probably eventually this one about ""ensuring the notification doesn't pop up too often"" i think 10 times in the last 3 weeks is excessive and if i wanted to create an account i would have by now. Also there's no ""X"" to click on and i have to completely close the app everytime that stupid message pops up.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sedfrey Dela Cruz,Great App. I use it on all my devices. Best feature for me is how I can pin my fav contacts and create an sms group. However I would appreciate if you can remove the option to open menu/settings via swipe gesture. These are back gesture on android 10 and I always swipe to go back but I am ending up opening the menu. The 3 horizontal lines opens the menu already so I don't need the swipe for that. Or atleast please have the option to turn off the swipe gestures within the app.,5

""Bad email/password"", etc. Then when I follow the link in the app to delete the account and start all over and enter your email and hit submit you get ""Something went wrong"" endlessly. Also, how do you restore your pro account if you delete and reset with a new email? In any case, not working at all since the update. Very frustrating. Until this is fixed I'll have to go back to MightyText. Was never a fan of that app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Used pulse as my default msg app for a couple of years now and never had an issue. I find it much better than others I have tried.

It needs to improve on interface when you select a message, there is no significant highlight or tick arrow, which is a major drawback.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse is a pretty solid SMS app. It has an incredible amount of features. I really enjoy the archiving function and putting messages in a designated group. I paid for the lifetime support and it works GREAT. Having four android devices, two PCs, and a MacBook makes this app so worth it. The sync works well with all of them. I'm hoping when RCS rolls out that this app implements it. For the time being you can't get an SMS app better than this",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mand,"Tempted by scheduling and folders, but they don't work as expected. Send time of scheduled SMS is up to 15 minutes wrong. With folders, you can't add a conversation from within the conv., or from the conv. list, only in Manage Conversations - very inconvenient - BUT the conv. list still shows all SMS with no indication of which you've categorised, which is the whole point.

I've been using Pulse for a couple of weeks moving away from Textra (I stopped getting auto confirm codes and they wanted me to the troubleshoot their server bug).

I'm unsure what underlying architecture differences are to blame but no other third party app suffers from inconsistent image transmission I've worked with provider tech support and tested 6 different messaging apps.

Texting takes me a lot longer on my phone than it does on my personal Windows computer and work MacBook. Yes, has programs for MacOS, Windows, and Linux; as well as apps for Android and iOS devices. You can also use Firefox and Chrome extensions if you prefer that method. The developer has been impressive at keeping it up to date on all of these options. It's the closest thing Android phone users will get to iMessage (from my research).",5

I stumbled upon Pulse while searching for proper substitute for Textra (which I absolutely love), due to a bug or possibly an incompatibility issue which caused me to no longer receive MMS messages. I decided to give Pulse a whirl and I'm very glad that I did. I found that Pulse and Textra are actually quite similar in terms of quality, user experience and user customisation. Here is the upsides and downsides of Pulse in comparison to Textra (my subjective opinion): Pros: > Pulse allows me to send and receive MMS messages with no issues at all > The ability to customise the style and colours add that touch of personality that we all love Cons: > The input has fair bit of lag, which can be frustrating at times > The application features no built-in emoticons, so if your keyboard doesn't either, you cannot use them (not huge deal, just a bummer) Overall, I highly recommend giving Pulse a try; I don't think you'll be disappointed.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris K,"Soooo happy with this app! Everything I want and nothing that I don't. A breeze to install an set up So, I did love this app is until I got a new phone. It didn't sync correctly and all of my old messages are now only accessable on my tablet and will be completely gone when I have to replace that. I assume that if my tablet is replaced and I eventually replace the phone again, my account will be effectively locked out. Be careful if you need to sync your devices",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,mary painter,I love my pulse app. I love that I can check my text messages on any device. makes things alot easier.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,catfeathers,"I love so much about this app but if I try to send a 9 second video, it gets butchered so badly it's impossible to see what is even going on. Otherwise it's pretty good! I like that it turns longer texts to MMS so I don't accidentally send someone like 6 smaller texts in chunks.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,TheDesertsweeper,"After installation it showed: ""Optimizing... Just working on getting your messages into the app it won't take long"". Then after about half an hour the phone screen went black and I couldn't get it to do anything. Another hour passed and it came back to the same message. Still there a further hour later. Zzz. Never moves past this screen a day later. Uninstalled.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like this message app and would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that you have to fill in a phone number before you are allowed to type a message. Often I need to write the message first, make sure it's correct or want to prevent sending it by accident before I'm finished typing. But with pulse I don't have that option. It's really annoying.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,T L,"I've been using this application for a while now and thought it was really great, especially since I'm using a dual-sim phone. After a recent update, however, it keeps bugging me to create a pulse account. I only use it on my phone and don't need an account so quit bugging me before I find something that will just leave me alone. Changed review from 4 to 2 stars. Edit: More than once is too often, if you wanted to sell it fine, I'd have bought it but I won't be pressured into buying a ""feature"" I don't need/use. It seems Pulse was sold to Maple Media in October, which might be why this pops up after the Dec update. I rolled back to an old version from July 2020. If the issue returns somehow I'll just find an alternative.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Russell,"Can't send a message, it keeps bringing up an old message when I type a name in. Used to work but no more. I reinstalled and tried everything I could think of. It won't send messages. The adverts for the Plus version and a review are persistent.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Ann Elizabeth,"I don't receive all of my texts through this app. For some reason, my phone's native text app gives me text messages. Then I'm unable to reply in the native app, so I reply in Pulse SMS. IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING to have the received half of a conversation in the native text app, and my sent half of a conversation in Pulse SMS! Please fix this problem ASAP, or I'll change to another text app. Thank you.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This is a great messaging app. It has browser support as well. My only complaint is the inability to designate primary device with a switch in the settings. I really hate having to re-install when I switch device with my sim card.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"good. some contacts do not appear though.. BUT you can still send a message to it.. but it goes nowhere since pulse doesn't recognize the contact. having problems with private conversation.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love using this as my main texting app as it doesn't seem to break up my outgoing messages to my friends on CDMA networks! Only one thing I get a little annoyed with though, and that's the notification LED color that Pulse defaults to on the OnePlus 6, it's always white and no matter what I do I can't change it to green or blue like stock messages is.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I wish it could adapt to the phones downloaded theme.. or that it didn't have to be the phone's default messaging app .I downloaded so that I can use on my tab but really didn't want it on my phone.. if you don't dowload on phone your unable to see your sent messages on other devices. you can only see the rec'd and I don't think the mms show up either.. I have paid version,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Scot Sakelarios,"It used to work, but account won't log in for multiple devices any longer. No response from support... Well it took opening a case with the parent company, but once I did, support worded with me. Unfortunately no phone support meant many emails to get to the root.. which I'm not sure we really reached as I just created a new account and I'm back on line. This product is the only secure way to have sms on an Android, windows and iOS. So glad it's working again.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jinesh Patel,"Notification sound is not working on MIUI 12.5 :( This is the only app in which it doesn't work, weirdly on ""Test Notification"" sound works but not on actual SMS. Please fix this. Feature Request: Can you add multi conversation delete directly from search results? For example, if we search for OTP we can get the results from various senders but there's no easy way to delete all old sms containing OTP in one go. The option to bulk select and delete would be nice in such cases.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,stíobhart matulevicz,"Been using it for years and paid for a lifetime subscription. Until recently, its been flawless. Of late, however, half of my messages get stuck on ""Sending"", when using the web interface.

I still would like to see my own and my contact picture avatar in each private text thread.",5

I see that I'm not the only reviewer to have this issue. I have not had this problem with any other SMS/MMS app and it's a show stopper for me. I hope this gets resolved in the future.

New ones would do the same after a few days. Reinstalled the app & they were back but would disappear again days later. There would either be a small white ""squircle"" or a blank space where they were. Dev didn't know why this was happening nor how to fix it. Other SMS apps don't have this problem so it must be Pulse specific.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I just switched to this app & I don't know how to send messages to the new folder which I created in the menu. Obviously the star rating will be changed on quick proper solution. Edit: After some settings it's working fine. Thank you for the quick response.,5

Unlike other messaging apps they go right away..,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shug S,"Used to be a great app for texting but since upgrading my phone and installing the latest version, I'm sad to say the app no longer plays audio when texts are received.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app to bypass 10 maximum conversion with AT&T. very easy to use . conversations are organized by days and you can very easily have you favorites on the top for easy access. Try it you can remove it any time, but I am sure you will keep it., this is what happened to me.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeremiah Berndt,If you want to use this app with your watch just realize right now it is hot garbage. I should have read the faqs first before I put money into it. It is slow for notifications and the only fix is to connect the watch to Wifi so it gets them faster. If you don't install the app you will get them right away. I also told them the website they use to get activation for your watch doesn't work and they never fixed it. Wanted to love it but Google Messsages works 100 times better.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have used this app for YEARS and adore it. I'm a little ocd and tried multiple messaging apps, but they all annoyed me, until pulse. I LOVE how customizable it is. I've set each contact as. Separate color, so no risk of texting the wrong person. Just this month, I bought an iPhone 11. Once I received the phone, I went to download Pulse. this app so much I returned an iPhone just to have access to Pulse.... I love the app so much I base my PHONE on it! I won't have a phone w/o pulse",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall, a pretty darn good app. There are some rather significant deficiencies, however: Have found no way to lock & permanently perserve specific texts; no way to easily delete multiple, selected texts while preserving others in the same line of conversation; audio alert for receiving texts seems to work only sporactically.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mitzi Fountain,"This app works great! I haven't had an issues with it. I will say that one thing that needs to be updated is when you archive a message and if you want to bring it back into the ""inbox"" it says something opposite on it. It still works but the wording is off.b",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Best combination of features. I like archiving messages. I like scheduled messages. I like the auto response message based of keywords feature.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Brandon Smothers,"Awesome app. Lots of options and can save to the cloud with subscrition. Great for dual SIM phones, the ability to designate a sim to a conversation is key. I also like the ability to group contact/messages into a folder, for me to keep work and personal separate.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"recently changed my sms app from Go SMS Pro because of problems after an ""upgrade"" and constant barrage of ads. I would have given Pulse a five star rating but it's missing one essential feature. It seems that Pulse will not send a message unless I have a mobile network connection. the text is stored and has to be manually resent. Go had this great feature that stored the message & automatically sent it when a mobile network connection was restored. Please could we have this feature in Pulse?",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app especially if youd like to text through your computer or shared devices. Wish there was more customization on the app and more features. Would be great if implemented features to communicate better with apple users. (apple users seem to have a hard time receiving media files).,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent replacement for your standard SMS app... As an alternative, this is a very capable, accomplished, polished app. It immediately found and synced all of my pre-existing SMS messages. The look-and-feel is thoughtfully designed too... In particular, I like the default day/night theme.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Spencer Wilson,"Pulse is the best SMS/MMS experience I've had. Leaps and bounds ahead of default-ware, its depth of customization options, clean UI, and powerful interface make it an extremely useful tool. My only complaints about Pulse are related to shortcomings with texting protocol in general.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,H Wickman,Love that I don't have to be tied to my phone to get messages. Easy transfer from old message app . Non complicated so was able to figure out features. Only at beginning I accidentally erased a conversation when I meant to erase a segment that failed to send due to reception issue.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Amalea Jubara,"This is my favorite messaging app second to WhatsApp. I really like that I can schedule messages and also pin specific conversations to the top. One negative is when clicking links it does not open it externally right away, it tries to open it internally but that usually doesn't work.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dani Lowery,"I absolutely love this app and have been using it for a long time! One feature I would really like to see added is what iPhones have built in: To see when someone is texting me before I get it.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Downloaded the app and started using it. Tried to customize some features and could not figure it out. Emailed Luke and he provided information on how to change some settings. Told him that I was looking for a way to show icons next to images. Told me that was not part of the app and he wouldn't refund my money for a lifetime subscription that I had signed up for. Tried to get my money back within 24 hrs of purchasing subscription and the developer refused to refund my money.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shannon D,This used to be my favorite for years until recent update with annoying notice asking to upgrade to premium. Uninstalled and had to look for something else.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"My company blocked Google Hangouts so the primary means by which my wife and I talk through the day was gone. I'd use it on phone and desktop. This app and its abilities across platforms bridges that divide. Texts come through quickly, and the UI is most attractive. $10 for life? Unbelievable price for functionality across devices. Please implement audio and video messages in the web-based client. It's a pain having to grab my phone to hear/see them.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Wood,Intermittent usability Group texts don't come through. I miss messages a lot. Integrated browser messaging has sign in issues and is fairly unreliable. No error messages to tell the user what's happening. Low hanging fruit that should already be included in an app you have to pay for!,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really like this app; being able to pin a contact on the top, assigning colors, and it seems to work well with my phone BUT I lose the ability to assign notification tones to contacts.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Most complete SMS app out there. I liked Textra, but it didn't allow me to share location or schedule messages. This allows customizability and paying the one time fee so I can use it across multiple devices is a nice feature that allows me to utilize it more while completing other tasks.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This truly looks like a beautiful messaging app... but the auto-respond doesn't allow for responding to all texts coming in from a specific SIM card. I would have to program a separate message for all possible contacts texting me at that number. As a result, I decided to go with a competing app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,the idea about the app is great and parts of it works terrific but the fact is I never know if my group chats or anything with pictures is going to be delivered. It worked great in the beginning but as of late more times than not pics do not get delivered nor do group chats in general. anything from the computer app is delivered 80% of the time but that's enough misses the I have gone away from it twice and now I think I'm gone for good,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app! It'd be really nice if we could change the theme settings independently between phone and tablet. Specifically, I need a larger font on the tablet, but not on the phone. Currently, you change one, it applies the change to both. Thanks!",5

I love the color schemes, the privacy settings, and the ability to save all the messages to one account so when u get a new phone, all your old messages will be on your account...

Ive already paid for lifetime membership, but if this cant be fixed, then I'll need a refund",3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse is just amazing. Where Google messages leaves us hanging (web sync still not working anyone?....still can't schedule a message to be sent at a future date...), Pulse has picked up the baton and run with it! I use Pulse on Mac and PC and of course my phone. Because texting is so easy from my computer using Pulse, it has improved my social life (especially with my friends who are text only people who have full conversations via text). I'm more willing to schedule times to get together too.",5

However, somehow, even though I specifically had turned auto-updates off - Pulse automatically updated itself. Now, ever since the most recent update (today's date is May 8, 2020) the main thing I had been using it for - scheduled texts - have completely gone off the rails. Tonight when it texted a new potential landlord at 9 pm instead of 9 am was the last straw on this. Please fix ASAP! I miss the old, working version of Pulse!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jean Chisholm,"I'm still in the trial period. (I had Textra, love it, but it doesn't have an across-all-platform option). Customizations on Pulse that would be nice are my outgoing message bubble and sent sound. (Maybe I just haven""t found the settings to change those.) Otherwise, it's a great app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The feature set is OK, and the UI is nice to look at. Wear OS support is very cumbersome, it only uses a battery draining white theme, and requires all messages to be synced through the cloud, with the subsequent security risk.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Petterson Grande,"Amazing Experience. I have been using Microsoft app to send texts via WIndows 1o, however if you have a Tab and your device was purchased through ATT or Verizon they will not authorize sms cross devices.

I like the app, but delayed messages need to be changed. Don't get me wrong, I love the feature, but if I'm correct I think there should be a button to send it and override the delay. Thank you",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dale Peterson,Excellent program. Very happy with it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rahul Patil,"when a sms arrives, I can't see any notification at all. Everything else is good.

I searched a lot in settings it's all set properly, notifications turned on, but still no notifications. it will be useful especially in case of copying the OTP in transactional SMS.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Best messgaing app so far for me. Others made notifications go away if you glanced at them in the notifixation bar, and then they wouldnt even show up as unread in the apps. Not so with this one!! Also, what sold it for me was the persistant notifications. I am infamous for not getting back to texts. This app is AMAZING at programing in reminders to actually LOOK at your texts and respond to them. 5/5, just amazing for what I need",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Ron Jarrah,"Almost perfect. But it is missing 2 features that Textra has that is a deal breaker for me. Custom chat features delete when the conversation is deleted. Mute conversation and custom notification sounds for a conversation get deleted when the chat is deleted. Textra remembers these.

This app allows for customization and works great.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very customizable app, my one suggestion is on delayed messaging is to at least have it as an option once you start typing during the delay period to cancel sending the message until you hit send again, if I start typing again I probably don't want the message to send until I'm finished with what I'm adding to it. Kind of a nit pick but it would be cool if it was an option, still a great sms app",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Wetzel,"In my opinion, the app is subpar. I downloaded it because it would work with my smart watch. I have the same issues with MMS messages that others have posted in their reviews. Seems like it's a known issue that still has not been resolved. Also, I know damn well what I selected as my password, but it somehow doesn't work to log in and there's no reset password option, all I can do is delete the account and restart it? And in doing so it wipes out all previous messages? I can't do that, this is bogus. Wish I had read the reviews before paying $20 for it.

However, if you copy and paste or forward a message or photo, it is hit or miss on whether it is received by the other party or parties. Yesterday, this caused me to miss out on a real estate sale. GOODBYE PULSE. By the way, I have a paid version, and had been using it for at least 2 years.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steven Essex,"I love it. I have bad cell service where I love but get pretty good wifi, and if you pay a very small fee to buy it ($2/month, $5/year, or $10 for a lifetime [prices are approximate]) you can use it on your main phone and up to five other devices with internet, and it updates each one with both your incoming AND outgoing messages. Literally you could let someone watch your conversation in really time, and it's password protected.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,DCsPr0ductions,"This app is absolutely perfect for users who don't have an esim capable phone but still has a data capable watch, I can leave my phone anywhere and aslong as that has WiFi or a mobile data plan then all your texts get sent to your watch, this app is perfect and for 99p a month its a well designed app, blows the andriod messaging app out the water, its cheap, handy, plus pulls you out of needing a contract for an esim :) love it",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The most reliable app for texting from your computer. The Mac OS app is faster and more stable than other solutions that run in your browser, such as android messages web interface. Great for work if you have to send a lot of text messages and youre already in fromt of a computer",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Luuta,Presented with a subscription form immediately. Immediately uninstalled. A free version with an option to upgrade to the professional version hidden away in the settings would be less intimidating. Or a paid version to buy before installation. I don't like the tactics used here.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brandon Moreau,"Excellent app. Syncs on a lag between Phone and Desktop though, have to sync manually. May just be my connection. Can't see as far back in list of recent contacts as I'd like on the desktop app. But overall a great app. I bought the lifetime license.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,J Gillman,Used to be good (not perfect) but an expired certificate has stopped the web site and Windows app from being usable. And there's no way to contact them if you can't get to their site. [sigh] *** Update ***: after a 2-day outage things are working again.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great messaging app. I normally would use android messaging, but when they no longer supported the widget on my phone, I looked around for other options,and found this! Very functional and has some unique features like being able to schedule a text.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Eric R,"It's OK. If you are considering this for sending/receiving SMS texts on your laptop or desktop it does a decent job. The app on windows is why I have taken stars away. I've only been using it for a week, and already multiple days I have experienced texts that don't show up on either than desktop or mobile app until about 30 minutes later. I also wish the Windows app allowed you to do more. There is still a bunch of things that you can only do on your phone",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kurtus Kahle,"Very glad I switched to this app. The best of many texting apps I've tried. Full-featured, and the text from computer support is great. A couple quirky features, like the conversation title not changing automatically if you change a contact name.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kathy Kerber,"They let their certificate expire, and none of three browsers will access the log in page because it won't connect due to the expired certificate. And my clock is not wrong. This is ridiculous has been going on the entire day (expired 12/10/21) and they have not even attempted to let me know they are trying to fix the issue. As far as I can tell, I'm stuck permanently. I am a lifetime purchaser. I had given pulse a 5 star review. Wish Luke Klinker was back. He communicated with us and we knew he cared. This new company is failing terribly. Yes, it is now owned by Maple Media. I am NOT impressed",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael A,2021-12-26 Another year and I still prefer this SMS app. Key feature is texting on the desktop as well as my phone. 2nd key feature is scheduling messages ahead of time. 2020-10-31 Used this app for years now. Many texts are sent from my computer rather than my phone. So much faster texting with 10 fingers typying over just thumbs. Great tool. ***Would love it more if Pulse could connect directly to my phone service provider when my phone battery dies or my phone is off.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Stacey,"Used to be awesome!

After 10 mins I paid the small fee for lifetime membership (if I remember right) that been, I'd say over a year now, I haven't regretted it for a day! Now I'm not sure if it because of this app or because of some setting but I can't answer my phone. No screen pops up. Nothing in notification even. But like i said could be from settings or the app Showcaller that I also downloaded for spam blocking mostly..",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far, so good. Works well on my Wear OS watch, my phone, tablet, and computer (as a website). Haven't tried too many advanced features because my motivation to purchase the app was simply to have one texting app that I could use everywhere, and for that, it has been great.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Camille Custodio,"Great app, pretty seamless when alternating between phone/PC. I think the only problem I have with it is that videos that are sent tend to be pretty bad quality. But those aren't sent over sms too often so it's not a big deal for me.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank Catalano,I've tried many messenger apps and found this the best available. It's easy to add contact info and manage groups including notifications. You can search all messages or just the content from one conversation. Many more features and it's stable. One of the few that's earned 5 stars from me!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sejal Dalal,"I paid for the app because initially it worked well - bought it mostly for its scheduling functionality because its imperative in my line of work that messages to customers to make payment, go out on time. 2 things suddenly started happening simultaneously. What would show on the computer as message Sent, (not ""Sending"", App shows actually time the message was sent) does not show as sent in my cell and the customers don't get it the message. And when I manually send the message, both the scheduled one and the current one get sent out at the same time. This morning again was the last straw. I schedule my message to go out at 9am at work hours. It just sent a scheduled message from a previous day to a client at 530am the next day making me look extremely unprofessional. Before you go ""hmm"", Battery optimization is off for Pulse SMS and I do not let memory manager stop Pulse. Uninstalling even though I paid for it - trying an alternative.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Seikred Mise,"Price is a lie. I was about to purchase it at at $10.99 lifetime, i checked several times but once you click it and it takes you the app store it becomes $36.99.

It's take time in sending the SMS, sometime message not sent for no reason, also many times it's doesn't show delivery time and status of SMS. 2.

I've been using it so long that I don't remember why I needed/wanted to switch from the built in texting app of my Android.

Does not have a way to turn OFF emergency notifications. There are three types: presidential, severe, and Amber Alert. The Amber Alert are particularly annoying because they override audio settings and blast loud alerts in middle of the night when a child is missing.

Love all the customization options, pin favorite conversations, custom alerts per conversation and dark mode are an absolute must. Pulse replaced my default Samsung Note 10+ SMS message app because several things were irritating me such as the popup ""Group msgs will be sent as MMS"" notification every single time when opening a group message. *Edited* My bad, I figured out the in-app notification issue. I love it now! 5 stars.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have been using this app for nearly 1 year and am done with it. The app is way too buggy. It seldom syncs properly with Windows 10, I am constantly deleting and reinstalling, and frankly, it's too much of a pain in the ass for a subscription app. I gave this app the benefit of the doubt for way too long because I like the idea of being able to text from the computer. However, I cannot recommend.",2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Shari Fritz,Really enjoying the Pulse SMS app. I have used it in both my phone and tablet. I've had it for over two years without any problems. I really like the customizations (background/color/notification sounds) you can make per person.,5

If I am in a conversation and somebody else messages me, when I back out of convo 1 to check the new message, convo 1 is still listed as the most recent and even gets time stamped with the time I backed out of it.

Warning, The app isn't supported with all phones and I can't receive picture text messages. It also did not transfer over a portion of my texts.

I can schedule messages to be sent in the future, I can pin conversations to the top (useful when you are waiting for a reply) and it shows the different group text participants with different colors.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Switched out of curiosity to try something different. I was using Samsung messages along with my Galaxy Watch and the Your Phone app on the computer. I was curious to see if the cross platform ecosystem here was better. I'm pleasantly surprised with how well it works. And the Android app is polished and works well. The Galaxy Watch app is very well made also. All in all it's the best SMS app I've used on Android. I also like the delay function.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe Cristina,Been using this as my default SMS app for a couple years now. The cost to use across multiple devices was well worth it. The other feature that really pulled me towards this app was the ability to block messages by key words. It has helped eliminate so many spam messages. Highly recommend this app.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Fox Stowe-Morris,"Paid for premium lifetime membership, yet it kept telling me over the past month by logging me out and asking for a paid sub to upgrade. Then it got rid of the option to log in altogether. Restoring purchase does not work either. This is a deceptive practice that will con you of your money if you don't pay how much they want you to.

I would love to start using this app again",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I'm never switching back to the native messaging app because of RCS. This is the best feature of the app. It is my favorite feature.

You can also filter Unread conversations and read any texts you have not read. I specifically like the capability to ID scam texts. That I love.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Erick M,"I like the app, but wish there was a way to display photos next to a users name when viewing text messages inside a conversation. As it is, it's just blank and looks odd to me. Also,.support for RCS (I don't think it has this) would be cool.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Glenn Welt,"TOTALLY UNRELIABLE, rarely syncs between Windows 10 PC running app inside latest Chrome browser and app running on Samsung A51 smartphone, refuses to install app on latest Fire HD 10 tablet or numerous android TV boxes. The $8.99 lifetime price was great until I realized that I must go back to the MUCH more reliable MySMS. P.S. I have over 40 YEARS of system build & software publishing experience.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dave Brandman,"After much testing, I have figured out what is going on, but not why. Basically, with Pulse as my messaging app, if a mms message comes in while my phone is turned off, Pulse will not retrieve the message, not even indicate the message is there when I turn the phone back on. If I go to the stock Messages app (by Samsung), the messages show up, with a message that a message is waiting, tap to download. I tap and the mms downloads in to Samsung Messages. Pulse never shows it.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Charles Quinones,I have had this app for about 5 years within he last 4 months had to reatart at least 10 times. Everytime i open .reinstall now....i can see messages ..when i click on one of them...the content goes away and all i see is a blank text area and if i touch screen the app feezes and then goes into app closing screen prompting me to restart....damm annoying....before support would respond quickliy....now i have heard nothing.....canceled my subscription...will try one more day,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shaibriel Mack,"I enjoy Pulse but it doesn't measure up to Textra. Has alot of customization features but could have more. I do enjoy the ability to have certain messages in certain folders or have messages hidden. Also, the group conversation name feature doesn't work",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,GREG GOLDEN,"I've used PULSE SMS since late 2019. Installed on my Android phone and android tablet. But I love the way I can work my messages on my Windows desktop PC. I just use the web app, though there is an actual Windows app too. Great to have synchronized message systems between my devices. . I am not sure of the encryption or security. I avoid using any SMS program for sensitive info. EDIT November 17, 2021... Upgraded to a new phone, installed PULSE SMS, and wiped all apps from the old phone. But PULSE does not work right on the new phone..... Nov. 18: The tech support person, Maple, explained how to tell the Pulse authentication system that I do not have the app on my old phone any longer. Once I did that, I was in full operation with PULSE on the new phone. (Pixel 5A-5G). thanks!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Grimm,"Absolutely loving the app. A lot more comfortable then my original messaging option in my phone, but I do have a minor issue where larger text messages get broken down into bite size, out of order pieces, which makes it hard and mildly frustrating to read. Is there anything to be done about that?",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I want to love this app as a replacement to messenger on my OnePlus 6T, but I've been having the CRITICAL issue of not receiving some MMS texts. When I switch back to my stock messenger app, I get a flood of missed or lost messages. I've missed extremely important work texts from my colleagues. Curiously, most of the missed texts from my colleagues are from those using iphones. After checking online for correct settings, I can't find a solution. I've resorted to my default messenger. Please fix!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Serah Yim,"Worth the few bucks. I never dreamed it could be so easy to switch b/w my Android phone, MS Surface, iPad, and bf's MacBook with such ease + my data feels safe (maybe it shouldn't ha) bc I'm able to delete msgs completely and use the web version on incognito w/ extensions like Ghostly. Overall, great functionality, thoughtful customizations, and, from what I can tell, privacy. Pls pls enlighten me if I'm wrong about safety/privacy~",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Originally signed up to the 1 year license. Now after a year upgraded to lifetime. It has all I need. Secure Auto message backup, desktop access to messaging, scheduled messages. Gets frequent updates. Have recommended it to other users who now use it as their go-to messaging app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan Meyer,Messaging app is close to perfect. Updating my review because I said there are ads which they aren't ads they're just their own company reminding you about the premium features if you switch to premium which is 100% worth it. I'm totally going to buy the lifetime membership when I have the money which is only 60 bucks or it's $20 for the year which is pennies if you think about it. For the delayed messages alone makes it worth it,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,JayR Thrush,"I downloaded multiple messaging apps for my new phone because I keep getting spam texts from different numbers. The one thing they have in common is they use my full first name in TY he message. No one I normally communicate with uses my full first name, in addition looking at previous commercial texts, none of Them use my name either. My old phone was able to block messages containing keywords, but this is the first one I found that will do the same on my new phone. Thank you very much!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Fran Garrett,I had been looking for a good texting app to replace the one on my phone because it had a glitch in it and it would not record some messages. I am very pleased with the Pulse app. I've been using it for 2 days and it has worked very well for me. It is beautiful appearance wise and has a lot of features.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The phone app and the windows version don't always sync up as expected. Even after checking to make sure they were both on the same network a text messages we're not appearing. Very frustrating When You're Expecting messages from people.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app, would be nice if there was a direct call button near the contact's name like on Google Messages. Also in the message pane the messages don't seem to extend all the way sideways, not sure if this is a feature or a UI glitch.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Seppuku Senpai,Messages missing and I hate how it wants me to get a login and pay for stuff,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"When i first downloaded this I was very happy because my Samsung watch could access my messages so I could read them on my watch. Now just a week or two later any pictures that I send are not going through. I have to use a different Messenger Service to send pictures. It worked initially, it just stopped a few days ago. Does anyone have any idea why or what I can do to fix it?",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Awesome app but 2 suggestions: 1. Add swipe action of 'read' for the messages along with 'delete' and 'archive'. 2. Please show the date of the msg on the msg or just by the side or on top whatever. It just shows 'yesterday', 'this week', 'this month'. Its really hard to find the msgs. Kindly do the needful. It would be great if this is done.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sara,Works well! The first time I installed this app it didn't work on my tablet. None of the existing texts come over from my phone. I got a new tablet and tried again and everything appears to be working well. A few recent conversations didn't come over but the old messages are there so I'm happy.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brad King,"The only sms system you can use on your computer that actually works. Been using it for a couple of years now, has never failed me. I've tried so many others, they always end up giving me trouble, disconnecting, messages taking forever to go through. Pulse is hands down the best, nothing comes close.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Karen Cutler,"Great texting app. I love that you can access your messages from a computer, and keep all your messages if you get a new phone. The only thing I wish it would do is update the contact's photo. There seems to be a bug with this feature -- it's very hit or miss.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ava Ellensohn,Updated : paid for the Plus option and it doesn't work. Unable to log in. Pretty decent app. Love that I can text from my tablet and it has a delayed send option. Wish it had an auto driving mode that detects when I'm in my car. The font is tiny a bit. Overall not bad.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jen J,"I love this app, all the features are really great (scheduled messages, send delay, etc) BUT I don't get all my texts, and because I have no way of knowing what I'm missing (unless someone says ""hey, why didn't you text me back?) I can't trust it enough to keep it. 😭 I hate how limited Google messages is but at least I get my messages. Let me know when you get control over RCS messaging protocols and I'll come back in a heartbeat.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rhoda W,"UPDATE Feb22: Dropped another point as now can't send messages. Been trying since Nov21, reinstalled it, but no. Had to revert back to the system SMS. IT WAS good, but since moving to a new phone, I was given the update which I was trying to avoid on my old phone due to all the bad reviews. And I was right to be wary. I am constantly being asked to review - which I already have (!) and to pay and upgrade. I am not a heavy user, so I don't feel the need to subscribe.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Literally one of the best messaging apps out there! It's the closest to the old Android messages app before Google did so many changes. Love the option to customize each person's color, archive threads, and schedule a message. The only thing it's missing is RCS capabilities.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pretty good. Has the minimalism, customization, and cross platform support imblooking for. Can't seem to find a way to stop sorting conversations by date and just have a big, uninterrupted list. Being able to would make it a 5 easily.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really wanted to keep this app. I've been using it for months and just figured out that it has been the issue with me sending videos, alot of contacts not getting my texts and issues with scheduling texts to send. I changed to another messaging app and the problem is resolved.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Truett Ogden,"I got it solely because Android Messaging took away the ability to give each contact a specific color! It has been a lovely replacement. It is rare to find an app nowadays that is highly customizable, that looks good, & that works just the way you need it to.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"beware. if you use this app for a few days, you will permanently lose messages people try to send you. i used it for months and knew I was missing group sms if I wasn't online at the time. after reinstalling to give it a chance to grab these from my phone, I returned to default sms app. there are currently about a thousand texts from unknown sender that I've never seen. only the ones from the last couple days are available for download. it's very possible this app has literally ruined my life.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Makes my life a WHOLE lot easier. I personally use the ""template"" feature which enables me to quickly and easily send out repetitive text messages with the click of a button. it saves me a lot of time which in the end saves me a lot of money. Great App!!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rose Nguyen,"It was a great app and i love the customization options. But been having problems receiving incoming group texts or sending out group texts. Or getting group texts delayed by a day. With a heavy heart, I'm uninstalling and Next SMS app now. So far, no problems!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love being able to text from my tablet or another phone. If for any reason I can't find my phone I can still check my messages. Also, it is very customizable. The only little thing I wish it would do is let me select photos from my gallery to use as backgrounds. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Update, my original complaint about lack of Android Auto support proved to be a one time glitch. Otherwise a very good app. Replacing the stock messenger app that has an outgoing notification sound bug. Works well, but charges for the advanced features are ridiculous. Subscription? Lol",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Nice app and seems to do the job well. With other similar have had issues of not allowing me to set custom notifications and this does with no problems. Really handy to be able to send text from other gadgets. Like it and possibly prefer to Chomp that I have used for years.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,bella j,"All good things end. I've had this SMS app for years. When it was managed by the original developer, I very rarely had problems. I paid for Pro previously. Now it's been sold and the new company wants more money. Not gonna happen. Pro subscribers should be ""grandfathered"" in. Also, the now freezes frequently. Probably making app glitchy to motivate upgrading.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Lawson,"Updated 2022-02-18: My wife and I had been using this app for years using my Samsung Galaxy S7/J7 on Cricket Wireless (AT&T network). But around Thanksgiving 2021 we had to switch phones due to 5G compatibility. We now use Samsung Galaxy A32/A52 on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile network). Ever since we have not been able to send MMS messages. SMS goes fine, but MMS won't work. If it actually sends, it takes forever and the text is never received. Sometimes the message is received but the attached photo(s) are not. I've reached out to the developers with this issue with no response after four months. I tried again today and the issue remains. In fairness, I've reached out to Mint Mobile and they don't see any issues with the Network APN or other settings. Sad to have to not use this app anymore, but as many others have noted, the quality and support has gone downhill.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Carrie Nicoletti,I used to love it and have had it for years but It's running really slow the last month. Conversations that I have a lot of messages on are sometimes taking half to a minute to open once I click on them. I guess I have too many texts but I don't want to erase them either.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very good app, and I would give it top marks if it handled mms messages better. It scales down images to an absurdly low resolution. And I also don't get mms messages in the same thread as the rest of the messages. This is a huge annoyance.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Naveed Rehman,Truly awesome Message App Service. I am using it for more than a year. But found no problem. The mindful creativity is shown in this app by the Developers. Just I want to give a suggestion to the Developer that for the background please add an option to set any picture from Image Gallery. Anyhow it is the Messenger Application On The Google Play. So easy to use and a friendly interface. I really love it and enjoying. Weldone developers. Keep it up. Must Download. I love you Developers.Regards.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It's different. Has many new features not normally found in text apps. At first I was a little intimidated but after customizing my settings and acquainting myself with the new options I am in love with this app. So much better than any other available right now including the Verizon app which is plagued with problems starting with installation. It has a great dark theme too. I recommend Pulse to anyone who wants more!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,CS Co,"Amazing! Beautiful, simple, user friendly, intuitive interface. Most importantly, no ads! That's crazy. I don't know how they do it but I sure am glad they do. The only disappointing thing is that you can't lock individual text messages. I find that very very useful when I want to clean out my texts but I don't want to get rid of information that I need. It's actually something that I use quite frequently and the only reason that I'm not giving it five stars.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Cellphone app is really good but, the web app lags , it doesn't send the msg right away, it takes too long for sending the message. I wish if that could get fixed. the only reason I moved to pulse from Android message is to get better web app experience, as I mostly use web app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Everything works great, only reason for 3/5 stars is because while I'm sending out back to back texts, it freezes up for about 5 minutes and forces me to refresh the page after it's done freezing up. That cuts into my business time when it's doing it once or twice an hour. Fix that issue and I'll give 5 stars.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Solid app. Nicer than stock messaging app. Was using Signal until I had issues with undelivered messages. No issues like that with Pulse. Only downside is a couple more taps for some actions. I'm assuming it is a design decision to make group messaging easier.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I will not be using the app when my subscription is up. I do not receive my text message if I am on another app. I have emailed about this issue with no response. I have used Pulse on three different phones with the same results. If I have any other app open Pulse will not receive my texts. And basically I am sick of it... I have not restricted anything. The emails were sent starting back in May. Just emailed again. Got a generic reply. Thanks,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,absolutely love this app. especially after buying the lifetime membership!!! I can run this app on 2 phones and my laptop and continuously stay connected without any problems. never had a problem and have had for a couple of years. Flawless app!!! thanks again for making such an amazing app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Very good app love that it can be used on other devices. One thing that needs fixing is the scheduling messages. Not user friendly and i used it to send a message every minute for 5 minutes one day but sent them all at once. That would make it perfect.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"My sis and I bought this app hoping to reduce voice texting typos, but they continue to be an issue. Otherwise, it works similarly to the freebie included with our cellphone plan. We like assigning different color codes to contacts, but wish we had more choices in notification sounds.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Hansani Archibald,So far so good. I'm really enjoying the app. My suggestion is that the ability to customize individual contact bubble color for each chat be included. Also adding the contact picture/icon next to the conversation bublle replies in the chat would also be a nice added feature.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jay Tu (j2ez2),VERY smooth and fast. It syncs up with messages from the previous app but it missed some. Only thing i wish it had was the ability to add custom wallpapers and not just color themes. Everything else about it is fantastic.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Boomer,"You should really tell people that the features you spruke are not actually free and are only available on the paid version. For example, ""Syncing conversations across your tablet, web and wearables"" is a paid option. That's the big appeal of your 'free' app but it's not free. A bit deceptive peeps.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"love this messaging app! works seamlessly across multiple devices and the ""Send Later"" feature sets it vastly above others. Would be awesome at some point to offer P2P Encryption but I know that takes things to a whole new level in terms of cost, instructors and most importantly money. Great job on the App and love the regular updates!!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryan Salerno,"Pulse is the best. I hate leaving reviews when the app prompts me to do so, but Pulse is so good, I'm making this exception. How many times have I told someone I'm scheduling a text, and they go, ""You can do that?"". With Pulse you can, and it's only 1 of the many many things it does. Superior messaging app. Here's your review.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great cross platform messaging app! Works perfect between my phone (Pixel), tablet (samsung), and laptop (PC, Chrome)!! Engaging GUI, easy on the eyes, and intuitive settings! Would highly recommend! Developer is friendly and answers back to questions! Definitely worth the money for the pro version!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The dev is full of himself. If anyone's confused as to why smart reply suggestions are still showing despite having it disabled in Pulse, Android 10 brought the same feature and forced it on system wide. To disable it, go to Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications > Advanced (drop down) and turn off ""Suggested actions and replies."" Also, if people aren't receiving pictures you sent, try lowering the ""Max Image Size"" within Pulse's Customization settings > Advanced > MMS Configuration.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tracey Taylor,"Updated from 2017 to 2010: I love Pulse, and have used it for at least 5 years. It used to sometimes have a glitch, but not in the past couple of years. Highly recommended for desktop/tablet/phone SMS/MMS syncing!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Nice features, but inconsistent. When importing old messages, some messages were missing. It also seemed that I wouldn't recieve some of my messages and it also wouldn't send sometimes. I decided to go back to my phone's messaging app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I am completely disappointed with this message app! It has great promising features but it does nothing! You can't receive messages. My friend called me that I am not responding to his text messages, then I realized it this stupid app which I installed which is not working. I tried the normal Google messaging app to receive and it worked perfect. I am installing this!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Winston Villabert,It would have been an excellent sms app but the notification sound is not working for xiaomi phones. Then there's this sync issue. I compared the sms messages on my phone with the web sms and they're not in sync. Huge disparity. I canceled my app subscription today.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jack Huntoon,"I have been using the app for three days now and I could not be happier. It works perfectly well on my Pixel 4A, my chromebook, and... get this... my Kindle as well (although I do have to use the web server for both the chromebook and Kindle). Still, it seems to work flawlessly. I was one of the legion of disappointed Messages for Android users that kept getting notifications of messages not loading, but I'm quite happy that I have found Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gregory Robinson,i paid in full for a lifetime it seemed worth it cause i have many devices only one sim card now every device that connects to wifi connects to my cell # in real time sync with no problems. A good amount of options and settings are available to you . user friendly too.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cole McCarty,Functionality has consistently gotten worse over the past year. Had to uninstall as Everytime I exited a chat it wouldn't bring up my list of conversations. On reinstall it just won't import my messages. Already has deleted my backlog of texts on its own. Hate to have to switch but it's not usable anymore.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Efe,"Great app, works very well on all my devices though wish it had a feature to blacklist words. I'm getting lots of spam messages and Pulse only lets me blacklist the contact number. Unfortunately this doesn't help me at all since all of those spam messages are coming from different numbers. Would be awesome if we could block with blacklisted words.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've been using pulse for about a year now and I love it. It's cross platform functionality is great especially if you use PC's often. All of your messages are backed up on their servers so device changes are easy and convenient. I highly recommend it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Terrible experience. I have tired using this app for about 3 months. The first three times I installed the app is caused me phones wifi system to crash. Which resulted in me having to factory reset my phone inorder to get wifi working again. I just installed the app again today after waiting about a month since the last time hoping the wifi issue was resolves with it. Within ten minutes of installing the app my wifi started to fail. Fortantly i was able to unistall it before it crashed my phone,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Paul Borlin (Architect),"This app is awesome! Goodbye Google messages! Long awaited a SMS app that I could get away from the spying Google, but Google Messages always had the great features. Pulse has those features and more! Biggest wins for me: copy OTP's from messages, in-notification actions (even customizable!), and scheduled messages. Thanks, Pulse!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app has many more useful features & it works far better than Google Messages. The single new feature I would like is the ability to select multiple messages for deletion - It's a big waste time being limited to deleting one message at a time (Google Messages has the same limitation) - Perhaps this is a limitation of the underlying archaic SMS messaging system?,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This application literally split my messages into 2 chains. MMS picture thread and then normal SMS text thread. So friends messaging me pics I have to go back out and into a different discussion to view the pictures. No thanks. Also you can't turn off the portraits for users, which kind of sucks.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I rarely leave ratings unless really bad and don't want others to have that experience or really outstanding. The Pulse app, support and web page are all outstanding. I purchased the Lifetime subscription and now am using the app on an Android phone, Chrome Book and Lenvo Window 10 laptop seamless. Have many in my office considering purchasing some of them IPhone User.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Martin,I like it because I am able to use it with my Samsung phone and Tablet. I do wish that it would let you take videos and send. It only seems to be able to take pictures. Overall itnis a very good program for using with phone and wifi tablet.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian,"I do not understand why I cannot send even the shortest video on this app. I have to switch back to my old one if I want to do that. UPDATE: now, photos only occasionally go through and other files that I used to be able to attach can no longer be attached. I am done with this. I am going to actively search for a new app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Would rate 5 stars if the scheduled texts were a little more precise and went out closer to their scheduled times. I send out 6 every morning at specific times to make sure my kid gets ready for school and out to the bus since I go to work so early. Every day several will clump together. I do like how scheduled texts can be set to repeat daily, weekly, yearly, etc. Would be great to add week days only. Otherwise solid app, happy subscriber.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,What a lifesaver! Was using MightyText & paying $80/yr to text from my computer. This is $11 for LIFETIME!

xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Rullan,"I've used Pulse for years, and I truly love it so far. I do wish that we could see a more updated and modern look for the years to come. I also, do wish their was more instant messaging support, especially between pulse users. Hope to see what the future holds!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I only have one issue with this app. When interfaced with Android auto every time I get a single message to audible notifications play on my Android auto interface in my car I'm not sure if this is an issue on your end or on the Android auto developer sent all I know is that this issue does not occur with my default messaging app on my phone.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent SMS app with fantastic support. I've tried all the others but what keeps me coming back is the truly seamless integration with all my devices. I never worry about my messages as they are always backed up and available on whatever device I'm on. I also much rather give my money to a small business than a large conglomerate. In addition to all of these things, when I had a question, Luke responded EXTREMELY quickly! What more could you want?",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like this app as it allows me to access messages through pc, tablet and phone although message histories dont always sync. App is not great for sharing all photos (hit and miss) and video quality is very poor. Functionality and visually nice make this app my choice for sms messaging.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It doesnt show all messages in a conversation thread, other apps such as Textra show all messages, but Pulse cuts off at a maximum of 505 messages per conversation (even though messages are set to ""never"" delete), so I can't view really old messages from say 2-5 years ago. I paid for the 3 month subscription which I wish I didn't now. I will pay the full $10 if you can fix this, because there's some great features on this app that aren't available on Textra. Please help, I'd appreciate it",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mitchell Seldenthuis,"I really like Pulse's notification and response from notification system. The design of the app and text windows is very clean, with sharp edges and corners, as well as a variety of color options and settings for contacts and windows.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've been using Pulse for well over two years now and I can't say enough about it. It truly delivers on the promise of a cross-platform messaging app. I'm shocked Google hasn't bought it yet. I use both Macs and Windows computers on a daily basis and Pulse handles it all easily. It works just as well on my old Nexus 9 too. It is a bit buggy from time to time, but overall Pulse provides a great experience.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Everything I wanted and THEN some! So perfect! I love that it has both driving mode AND vacation mode. Both are fully customizable, plus I can customize the color scheme for each contact, PLUS I can use my own notification sounds. Where has this app been all my life, and how did I ever live without it?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I would give this ap more stars if it was capable of sending images and gifs in a better format. The gif portion built in sends them so small to my wifes iphone that there is no point and I can not receive images from her. I'm going back to Android message until this gets better. To bad I didn't try this option before paying the $10 for Life Time.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Elizabeth,"Love it! I have tried several messaging apps and have issues where other people do not receive my texts, pictures get sent to the wrong people, annoying ads or the app is just boring. Pulse is easy to use, free, no ads and nice color options.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really great so far. It's better than a good amount of text apps I've tried and it is really simple which is great when all you want to do is text with a reliable app. It has quick reply which is sweet. Would be 5 stars but for whatever reason you don't get notifications when you're texting someone in the app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I want to CHOOSE what individual non-contact message to list as spam, please, once I get it! To ""immediately delete and list as spam"" says to me that ALL non-contact messages you will automatically delete as long as I have that third option checked.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris Ekins,"Bought this because of the ability to SMS from my browser, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add the ability to take/add/send a picture using the phone's camera *direct from the app*. Textra is much better in this regard - and I prefer that over PulseSMS. Edit: Thanks - clearly I didn't look hard enough! Rating updated :-)",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Heather Nunnenkamp,I recently tried a few different texting apps after having used this for over a year. Now going back to Pulse because it works best on multiple devices. Never had an issue with texts transferring and one time issue with not sending/receiving texts turned out the be SMS/MMS setting.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Perry,its not the best app. when my phone screen broke i relied on it to send the texts to my other devices...the battery died and now that its charged and on (still no screen) it will noteven do what it supposed to do. they wont sync online or anything... its a disappopintment and ... i dont think i'd reccomend this app until it becomes a lot less persnickety about when it wants to work.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Al Edson,"Paid Subscription 2019. Ever since Luke sold this app to Maple it is no longer cross platform. I loved this app! Worked on several devices. I purchased a 2020 Amazon Fire Tablet 8HD+ and installed Google Play Services. Unfortunately Pulse SMS is not compatible with my device running Amazon's version of Android 9. I hope Maple can find a work around for this issue, there are a lot of people using Fire devices.",1

You need2create an account with pulse2use majority of their services apart from basic sms sending or receiving functionality. No option to make all messages as read with1click you need to do it manually. Searching for older like year ago is a tough job & a failure. Cross Syncing or backup or cross usage is just on display never usable.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank Cicchetti,"It used to be awesome, but not anymore. I have a Samsung & now, when I'm in a group msg I don't get photos or my texts are not seen by iPhone users....or, if I send a photo or receive a photo from an iPhone, it doesn't come through. Sometimes, regular text msgs don't go through so I've missed a few important texts & others haven't gotten important texts I've sent. I'm so glad I paid for this a while back. You guys are slacking, I know at least 15-20 people who USED to use Pulse, but now don't",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is great. I dropped it from 5 stars because I payed for the monthly fee to back up all my convo prior to a factory reset, and nothing backed up, nothing saved. I was disappointed to lose convo from people no longer in my life. Other than that the app is amazing. Works great. One of the best messaging replacement apps I've used.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Autumn Rose,"I love pulse a lot! The only reason it's not 5 stars is that often, certain people's messages will half of the time not come through to pulse and just go to my phone's messaging app. I have tried everything I can think of to remedy this but I nothing has worked, and it is rather annoying on a day to day basis.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Anna,Not getting push notifications! I usually love this app and in the past things were quick to be fixed but this has been an issue now for awhile. I have the settings turned on and I have done the test. I also have the latest version. Please fix!!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,HRC,I like this app. Was having issues with pictures sending on a standard messaging app and tried Pulse and haven't had any issues. I can't get it to play a notification sound but that might be user error - I haven't worked too hard on it.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Jensen,The best messenging app bar none... Though having said that I wish there was an option to disable the ”Group conversation” setting as I prefer to receive and send text messages without my texts or received texts being automatically lumped as a group conversation..I prefer straight contact messages.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,K S,"It's convenient and easier to use than default messengers. Plus, being able to cancel my messages is what pulled me into this app. I type often due to tiny keypads, and the power to review my message and cancel it appeals to me enough to download this app. Get this app if you want a streamlined messenger that lets you review your messages before sending them.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far so good. Messaging seems to work well for both individual and group messages. The ability to insert gifs is a bonus. The future ability to ""like"" or otherwise respond to a specific incoming message as in imessages would be a bonus upgrade for the app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I use a pixel 3xl after defecting from Apple. I did not like the default keyboard. This is easier to read, great access to microphone. And like you can long press to access symbols right off alphabet view. So many themes to pick from too! The Best!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app. I also like the way I am able to pin priority contacts on top... though I'm still in search for a messaging app as close to the meizu messaging app, this one will do. Though I wish I can transfer past messages from an old phone to a new one without upgrading, but Thanks and thumbs up!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rachel Lioy,Using this app instead of Message+ or the built-in. Love the colors! Intuitive and easy to use. Would give it 4.5 stars if I could. 6/17/21 update: the app no longer works at all and immediately crashes upon launch.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"My only issue that I have found is when you create a group text or are brought into a group text and you do not have contact information for some of the phone numbers, the name on the conversation does not update automatically when yo save the contact details. Also, editing names on contacts does not automatically update conversation names.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Update:I love how now when you are typing a reply in the notification and you accidently go into the app it saves that reply so you don't have to type it over! Update I love the quickshare feature and can't get over how slick the animations are for this application. Payed for the lifetime subscription and will never use another messaging app until this one is not supported. Amazing app! I love the custom message themes and I'm waiting for some expendable cash to pay for the lifetime subscription,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love it so far! The only thing I wish it had was the ability to insert emojis from the same menu from which one can insert photos and such. That is a minor peiece though and this app handles my messaging fantastically. I would definitely recommend it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"To be honest, at first I was hesitant of trying out pulse way back when it first started. Slowly, I've seen it grow into a beautiful magnificent app. Kudos to Luke for such a well developed and maintained app. Bought the lifetime subscription and now I don't even have to be on my phone at work and can seamlessly send everything from my desktop. Thank you for making such an amazing app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Unreliable. Used it for 10 months, wanted to love it, regularly found out from friends that they never received long messages I sent and I regularly had group texts not arrive until midnight, several hours after they were sent, like my phone was waiting until all other traffic died down or something not sensical. I'm done. Back to default Google Messages app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Vaida A.,I have been using this app for more than 3 years. And now I am thinking to delete it - I got disappointed with this app when I tried to send schedule messages the last few times. I chose scheduling time and..messages were late!

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I used to be a MightyText and Pushbullet person until I ran across this app. $10.99 for a lifetime membership for all the features of other apps and then some?

xyz.klinker.messenger,Rama Daje,"Overall I love the app but I consider switching apps bc when you are typing a message if your screen turns from portrait to landscape or vice versa the entire draft you have typed vanishes. Gone, disappears, never comes back. Very frustrating when trying to type long messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Paid for the full version because I wanted the sync feature. Im currently using Lenovo k note/A7010, android 6.0.

This doesn't happen when using google's msging app or textra :(",2

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really liked Pulse initially, even paid for a subscription. But while diagnosing why people werent receiving any MMS i sent, temporarily switched to default messaging app. Realize theres dozens of messages from the beginning of my subscription that I never received Thats unacceptable for any messaging app, but especially one Im paying for. 2 stars for good concept, liked what did work before realizing what wasnt. But ultimately reliability comes before features, and this is not reliable",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Psykek 2,"So far this is my favorite sms app. Nice design and theming options as well as loads of features not available in my factory sms app. My only issue is that emergency messages such as amber alerts, presidential messages, or weather warnings do not come through this app for me, so I have to switch to my factory sms app to see them then switch back. I'm not sure if this is caused by the app or my phone though and this is a minor issue to me, so I'm still rating 5/5.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"First off, pulse is a pretty awesome dual SIM messaging app. Once you get it all set up, it works flawlessly. I am having problems getting messages on my SIM one card though. It was set up for a Note9 and now I'm using it in a Zenfone 6 so that might be the issue. I am curious how an open source app can be secure. That seems counter intuitive.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Everything about this app is great. It's fast, smooth, user-friendly and has one of the best UI for a messaging app. Only issue that I faced is that I was able to create a folder but wasn't able to find a way to add conversations to the folder.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shadi Wadi-Ramahi,Great features but.. When you try to send pictures in texts it doesn't work! I have to switch to native Samsung app and pictures are sent then! Other than that rest of features are what I was looking for. Search continues for perfect text app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Josh Parks,This has a lot of features I have been wanting. Simple things like having the ability to have individual notification settings or hidden and secure chats. Really useful and nice interface. But lately they started bugging to pay per month and made me want to stop using this app.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,TYLER HEBERT,"I recently discovered Pulse. To be honest, i didn't expect much but boy was I impressed. It has a nice design with a sleek minimalistic interface. Its easy enough for beginners and perfect for those that love to go crazy with customization.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Benjamin Balota,"So far, the app has provided the features i need. Such as template messages, pin to top, and many others. I like that it allows messages to be received unlike other apps which became problematic after awhile and started to lag in receiving messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's such a great app. love it but i think just a little modification needed here is, when you are typing while replying from quick reply at notification bar, so before sending text if you switch to full mode the text you have written in quick reply disappears and you have to write it again in full mode.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan Hemphill,It has a lot of the features I want but it would get a 5 star if it would put a message in a queue for when the cellphone reception re-established. I work in a place with spotty reception and a queue for unsendable messages would make a huge difference for me.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love color coding for different contacts. Love that it syncs to my PC instantly. I'd love it even more if it continues to notify my of messages on my PC like it did the first 3 or 4 times I received messages. Then it quit. Kind of disappointing but good app,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Adam Irving,A really good messaging app. Smooth and good user interface. Sometimes I have trouble sending images (they do not show on receiver's end) if they are to Apple products but I am not sure if that is directly an app or carrier problem.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse not only has the features i use the most (ability to define groups and sender specific notification sounds particularly) it's cross-platform ability makes it my default messaging app. Adding personalize our custom notification sounds is kind of a pain tho, it would be nice if that was simpler.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I used to love this app until it stopped syncing my messages now it only shows about half of my messages.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"First problem. About 15% of messages sent from my laptop get stuck in ""sending"". I tried to refresh my account and now I'm locked out...had to re-create a new account. It finds my account but saying it's not the correct login. That's impossible as I use a password manager and have the pw saved.   This is a great app, but it's not delivering and making my life harder. Done.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Terrible customer service. And that's from the OWNER of the app. Couldn't fix my transfer of text issues properly; conceded I had to remove one set of texts on one phone in lieu of another; couldn't address the fact Pulse failed to back up old texts that appeared on my phone but wouldn't appear in backup. A shame.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kevin Gläser,So I've been back and forth with this app for years. I switched a few years ago after issues with MMS but I'm back now and the APP looks and works great!

EDIT: Yo, I already rated you. Stop asking me to do it again. 🤨",4

I never received support but just instruction on how to reset and delete the account . . . none of which worked.

I was 5 star with this app all the way until the sellout. No more. I'll reinstall one more time & see if things can get straightened out. If not, then bye.

The ads are not pushy so I don't feel like they are an issue with using the app. I honestly forgot I'd seen any until it asked me to rate them. I really like this app for being able to integrate all of my devices and communicate from anywhere,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Good alternative to the stock contacts app. Lots of features it works well and I've been using it for years. I couldn't access my Gmail account so I paid for this service again using a different Gmail account. When attempting to text from any device after following all of the instructions I get a message saying welcome back subscription verified but it will not accept my log in credentials no matter what I do. I'm almost ready to uninstall waiting to hear back.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Simple and effective. I stopped using Mighty Text because it was wayyyy too expensive overall and more and more bloated with relatively useless features for me.

Contacted developer and that's what i was told. Seeking another app that uses Cloud backup is the only way to go. I now use SMS backup to take care of this. TEXTRA is a better app, much harder to accidentally delete all messages. What a disappointment. Still waiting for a REFUND.",1

You have to pull the menu open in order to go into each category of text messages. It would be much more user-friendly if they were tabs across the top similar to Samsung messenger,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app was great but have had issues lately with receiving messages multiple times and the dual Sim function keeps disappearing. Reinstalling fixes it temporarily. Contacted support who got back to me once for clarification of the issue but haven't heard from them again. Disappointing.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Terri Cranford,I love the features especially text from any device. I love everything about this app. I recently went to paid due to not being able to send photos. I'm stumped. I have researched it. My carrier has no limit they may slow down my service at 40 gb but I have wifi so never an issue. Is there anything to remedy this situation? I also noticed iphone doesn't have pulse in app store?? Is there a reason why? The photos are a must. Thank u & I will email. I have Android. Put it on iph too & it text.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nick Collins,"Aside for the desktop apps on my Mac being absolutely bricked for a while in December, but I don't use the desktop app that much so it wasn't a major issue for me. This app has worked great the whole time I've used it. I love being able to jump seamless between my devices. The customization of conversation is nice to. No more worrying about accidentally sending nudes to grandma just make your partner's thread look distinct lol. My only wish for customization is if it could extend to group chats.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Belinda-Marie Purkey,"I love everything about Pulse SMS except there is not a functional version for watches. Yes, I can get read my texts on my Galaxy Watch4 through mirrored notifications, but I can't compose or reply from my watch. Pulse was smart enough to bring text messaging to multiple platforms, but let's keep it going.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,T Creasman,I have a Samsung watch and a Samsung phone. I was pleased to eventually figure out that I can use this app with my watch. So happy about that because it has been my favorite messaging app for years. I like the ability to personalize so many elements of it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank “Pancho” Watson,Android app works well. I did have to whitelist it in the screen lock so it wouldn't be automatically cleaned preventing SMS messages from being recieved. Windows desktop app works well. This was the main reason for switching to Pulse as I spend a lot of time working at my PC.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like the app overall. There was a period of time where it stopped syncing to my tablet but it seems to work again. I wish it would save my custom colors of people to the contact and not just in a conversation.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I don't usually write reviews but this messaging app is actually really good. It doesn't crash or take 5 years to send a message, and has tons of features. There are some things that you need to have 'premium' to unlock, but without them this app is still better than anything else I found. At least try it out if you're unsure, because I like everything about it",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far I do like this messenger app. I wish there was a bit more customization, such as font type and background images. Those are minor details I can live without. Is there a reason my phone doesn't light up when a text comes in? It did with my old messenger app. But if my screen has timed out and my phone is on silent, I'm not seeing text notifications.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ocean Wells,"I love the simplicity of this app and the ability to personalize it. However, whenever I try to text iphone users images, gifs, links or lengthy messages they never go through I have to switch apps depending on the message and who I'm sending it to which is quite inconvenient",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kem Wade,Excellent! Perfect for offices with limited cell phone use. The app uses a Chrome extension (no admin requirements to install on workstations with Chrome) and uses a password login instead of a QR code that requires you to have a cell phone on-hand (which defeats the purpose). Very solid purchase (I paid the one-time fee).,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,biloboly gregsmith,It meshes really well. I can easily text from PC. It really came in handy for when my phone screen stopped working. The style is nice too. True black on an amoled screen is sick. But that is just my preference.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Armando Ortiz,Its awesome app the regular Samsung message app doesn't have all features Pulse message app has either. Would be nice to implement Samsung pay. Add a better way to copy and past single sentences. The take picture with camera starts out a small part of screen can you always start at expand view? Doesn't have a way to select address to take you directly into Google Maps Some few minor enhancements like these would be cool,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Laurie Graser,I paid for it and it was never activated; it erased a bunch of my conversations; it doesn't send my messages at least 50%- they delete and I have to resend them; and it is not compatible with my vehicle's Bluetooth so I don't know when messages come through while driving. I'd prefer to get a refund of $21.39,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,M Crenshaw,The only security i see is a digit pass code for private messages. Being only numerical doesn't really provide much security. What is the level of encryption on pulse messages? Doesnt appear to be E2E. App has a seperate 'private' conversations section. If this product is indeed end to end encrypted why would we have to bother with a seperate private conversations section. Does this mean any other messages not private are not encrypted at all??,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The connection to my computer did not work well at all. Even on my phone messages would go missing randomly, but appear when viewed with Android messages or Textra. If the bugs could be worked out, it would be awesome, but for now I really regret paying for this app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Previous problem I had has escalated. Pulse doesn't play nice with the messaging app anymore, so much so that I have missed some important group messages. Pulse also fails to recognize any messages in my internal SMS server, so all the messages I previously had vanished. all relevant caches and data have been cleared in an attempt to solve, and nothing helped. Uninstalled; will try the app again when an update rolls out.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall a really good replacement for the Google Messages, which has become a system and battery hog. My only real gripe about Pulse is that for some reason notications seem to almost never work, so sometimes I dont notice i have messages until quite a while later when im using my phone and notice the app icon has been updated to show new messages.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,MATT DEVRIES,"Last night my phone decided to send out a bunch of old text messages to a lot of people at 3a.m.. ya, not cool!!! Even went ahead and sent out some pictures from my gallery. So, as you can imagine, I can not in any way recommend this texting app",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse bricked my phone until I uninstalled it: So I downloaded this and liked it at first. So much so, I bought the lifetime version for my PC and watch. Next day my phone kept freezing. I kept restarting my phone and then cleared cache partition just to see if anything happens. I tried using other message apps instead of Pulse because Pulse wasn't sending any messages. Those apps froze too. My launcher started locking up as well which means my entire phone froze and needed force shut downs. To make this long story short, I uninstalled Pulse and now my phone works perfectly again. If anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it. I want to use Pulse for multiplatform but this has been ridiculous. One app shouldn't brick my phone. Seems like it would be a 4-5 star app but I gotta give it a 1. I don't know what I'm doing wrong since everyone seems to love it. I'm on a Galaxy S8 with the most recent updates.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app has great potential. I rated it a 3 based on syncing issues that I had even after following the directions. Lost a lot of messages when doing that. But as mentioned, I think Luke is putting together a much better app than Messages.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jordan Creson,"Really great experience with this app. Great look and feel, and nothing about it feel buggy or off-putting. The web app for desktop needs some work, though. It's not great and doesn't have as many options.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app and one of my favorite texting apps. Easy to app to use. Would be be nice if you can just swipe right to call someone on the list of conversations and the ability to change people's individual color bubble in group settings as well.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mari Machavariani,"It would be great app if it supported duals sim perfectly. I have to switch manually every time I have to send message from different sim. if it had two send buttons for choosing from which one to send, or ar least if it had option to see from which sim I'm sending message, without looking in settings, it would be way better. I would give 5 stars.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jose R. (Joe),I could not download my messages via resync messages. I don't know why but it was not syncing with what was on my phone. I could not find a log out of account button. I had to delete the app off my tablet and download it again and log in. That was the only way my messages came back. Add a log out button or tell me where in the app it is located. Other than that awesome app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Deza,"A great app for Android users to sync with This app has been helpful to sync my Android Tablet and Android Phone so I can switch between the two devices to text and or call. I can schedule messages as well as set times of availability which will silence calls and texts during the time I have set the app for ""unavailable.""",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rick B,Terrible. I hated it. Notifications did not show message. Even the free Tmo app does that. Also note that it is a subscription not a purchase. So you will get billed annually. I also got billed automatically after the trial. $20 down the drain. I would avoid using this app.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chuck Gregory,I needed a reliable messaging app that lets me stay connected no matter what device I'm using. Pulse does that and more. No more resyncing the app every time it feels neglected. No more being able to send only from the phone. This app keeps me communicating!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mary Kennedy,"So far the App has served my purposes. It has great features. Scheduling is one of my main requirements and keeping my texts private in a group text is Paramount. It does that and more.... Try it. You will like it too. I hope...And also the Developer Team is very, very responsive. If you have a problem email them and they will respond ASAP. One thing l can't do is send group text with more than a certain number of people. I would like that. Enjoy",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love the app, but it stopped working with Android Auto. When it did work, I would receive notifications twice. I tried to do the fix that has been outlined, but it didnt work and still didnt work with the car. Went to Googles app. Wish this one would have worked.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Looks good, great customization, won't send all pictures. I have been sending pictures to family and friends and about 1/6 makes it through to them. I don't know what happens but most pictures won't actually be delivered. Very inconvenient.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've been very happy with Pulse. For me it turns my phone into a self-hosted slack of sorts. I have to use multiple devices all day, multiple platforms so this app is a godsend.   I knocked one star off due to a few small bugs. I may revisit the review once I've had a chance to investigate them. Nothing big.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Amanda Beaty,"I bought this app a couple of years ago. It's worked great. Until a month or so ago when I could no longer open links. Text lists for store coupons? Useless now because the links either won't open, give me a blank page, or give me everything except the actual coupon.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I enjoyed the app in the beginning. The ability to use it over multiple devices was perfect. However I receive messages hours after they are sent Like 12+hours. I just cannot take that chance so I have to use another app.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joitz07,"So far I love the app, it's blocking by phrase feature is by far the best part. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the app does not delete messages marked as blocked or spam, it only hides them. If you go into the stock messenger app you still have all the blocked messages. Update : when it's installed I cannot receive short code messages like authentication request. Confirmed with provider that is the issue. Uninstalling until fixed.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,nazar davis,"Hi there, I only got this app because I wanted to shedule some texts (bulk) and delete old messages, which the standard app doesn't let me do,, app works well replacing the standard and deleting old messages and shedule but have noticed a bug with bulk messaging - to do with listing your contacts abplabetical - search gives a limited list and not using search gives a slightly different result (slightly different order) than ""contacts"", once you work this out - great app,,, I use the free vers",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Instant sync with your desktop (Mac in my case). To date, other SMS apps which allowed me to respond from my work computer have been overly complicated or laggy. The one time fee is worth it. The layout is simple and set up was a breeze.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Of the apps that I can get for my Android phone, this one is pretty good! You are not inundated by stupid ad ware and you can schedule your messages which I find very useful. I would give it five stars if you were able to enlarge the print using your fingers. Unfortunately that doesn't happen.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Sync is pretty good and I have it installed on all my devices. 2 reasons it's not 5 stars yet: videos are very poor quality; if phone isn't connected to the network, you won't send or receive on other devices either which is a pain of your battery dies.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent! Does exactly what it was designed for.......... and better!

xyz.klinker.messenger,T J,"My favorite texting app! I do wish it had capabilities of responding on a message with a like/heart/etc, and be able to translate which messages are reacted to on iphone or messenger after I send them via pulse. I get a generic ""loved an image"" reply, but have no idea which image they responded on. I sent an email to support as a dev request, and hoping to see this functionality in the future. Love this app, group text management is the best!",5

I gave up and came back to pulse. I figured I could learn to live without a paragraph key. But a MIRACLE happened. The paragraph key WORK'S! So now I am one happy camper. And if your reading this Luke? THANKS for all your help. And if it was you that finally fixed your program, thanks again. Pulse Rules!!👍🙂😁",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I was going to give this app a great rating, but it won't send or recieve picture messages no matter what I do. I changed all the settings and everything. I made sure it was Pulse by switching back to my default app, and pictures sent and were received just fine. On an LG G6.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tom Maracek,Buggy. When you paste something and send it the app automatically repastes the same content into the next text box. Does this on all my devises. Also if you send a text without the area code to a person you will never be able to send a text to that person because for some reason it uses the number without the area code even after you add the area code. Other than that works good,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Seems to be quite a good SMS app with phone capability. I would also like to have the onscreen ability to change the preferred SIM to send messages. Think about this at the earliest. With this onscreen ability, I would change the rating to 5 stars!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Fantastic app, incredibly affordable subscription option. Perfect replacement for Facebook messenger's SMS service. Has color-coded SMS that carries over into group chats, the hard-to-find mark unread option, ability to rename group chats, sort into folders, and schedule messages (never knew I wanted this but I love it!)",5

Also, I frequently need to disconnect from Wifi in order for a text message to send. Had quite a few angry friends and family who I sent important texts to, but which never actually sent. Could just be my phone though. Who the hell has a Blackberry Priv?",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app! I've tested out literally hundreds of messaging apps over the years and Pulse is by far my favorite. I give it five stars based on usability, flexibility, stability, and responsiveness of the developer. I can't want to see what comes next!",5

My texts weren't being received although the status said delivered. I switched over to this app from the preinstalled messenger, but I'm disappointed.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've been using this app for 3 years now and I used to be happy but right now I have one small issue with the app. This app crashes frequently both on Android and my Mac. By crash I mean the app gets opened but it shows blank screen. I understand that this can happen on my mac due to internet connection but why this is happening on my Android? Also another BIG problem is that every time that a new version comes out the old Linux version doesn't get the SMS and the software doesn't alert you that a new one is out. But the Windows version does that automatically. I recently bought a mac too and I don't know if this is a problem with Mac or not.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a really good app, it looks wonderful, much better than Google messenger, and has amazing customization options, however I more than likely will not receive any picture or media attachment on my Galaxy note 8 ESPECIALLY when connect to my smart watch, which is a really big issue. But unlike Google messenger I can still use Pulse without it being my default messaging app on my phone (if you pay for the premium service, I have lifetime) so for the time being I'll just stick to Textra, and use this for the quick replies on my watch",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love it for soooo many reasons. The fact you can customize all of the colors is a big winner for me. You can mark messages unread is a HUGE + for myself. The abilty to pin messages to the top. All makes this app the 💗 of my life. Im in sales and need to get back to certain messages with persistent follow up being able to pin these to the top helps me stay focused on my $$$!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"it claims to be the best, it looks and feels nice, but doesn't give much control and information regarding the sim card that was / will be engaged in the SMS traffic. I understand that such features are not important for single sim phones, but for dual sim phones IMO it is. I like to see directedly which sim card received the SMS and which one I use to send. Hence for a single sim phone I would give 5 stars, but for a dual sim phone it is only 3 stars. (If I missed a configuration setting that allows full control and information, or if a future update will provide this information I'm happy to update my review to 5 stars.) ETA: Thanks for the prompt feedback and advise; changed it to ""default"" SMS app and indeed SIM # showed up. That's worth 5 stars.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Thomas Adams,We enjoy using the app. Helped my dad to load it and replace the app on his phone. He now receives all of his messages and pictures and is very pleased. The original phone app had problems and would frequently not process and display text messages and pictures.,5

(Verizon's does). I searched online and found Pulse. It does all that I want it to do . Now I can be using my tablet or laptop and not miss text messages. Some of which are time specific (ie... grandma, I missed the bus can you drive me to school). Thanks Pulse!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Noga Sadeh,"By far the best I have found Excellent features. Have been using it for a long time now. Every time I tried something else, I ended coming back to this one.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Craig Gruneberg,"App is not working properly on iOS. It does fine on Android. I have brought the issue to the developers attention with no response. Now I can't enable Notifications on iOS. Move the slider to on, save, come back to check and slider is off! Frustration continues.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app is simply fantastic! I've used similar messaging apps in the past to sync messages over multiple platforms but they're buggy and clunky and didn't allow certain features. Pulse offers it all and then some. I love this app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app exceeded my expectations, I looked all over for scheduled messaging and even paid for a workaround on another app. This app does it for free and is more convenient and has extra features. I have only touched the tip of the iceberg.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I originally rated this app 5star. I really like the way it performed on my phone. I decided to purchase the live time subscription - started testing it and everything looked great, text sent/recived on my windows pc. Than all of a sudden the pc stopped sending or receiving.

I have yet to test some of the privacy features, but so far, so good.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Renewed my 3 month membership. I was billed twice. Upon contacting google they credited me 1 charge. I checked my cc statement today and they charged me again. UPDATE: Recieved feedback from the seller. Who was very combative from the start. After multiple back and forth emails and showing proof of the double charge. He is not taking ownership. He would rather keep his 2.59 cents rather than have many future purchases for this service. This person needs a crash course in customer service.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,M P,"Simple, robust and effective. Does everything I want from an SMS app: color coding, archiving and other useful features. I switched over from Textra, please don't do what they do, i.e., remove features and add others that add nothing like android bubble notifications.",5

People are NOT getting most of my text messages and alsoI am not receiving 50% if not more of the text messages that are sent to me. It doesn't matter that it worked fine for the last six months in a only matters that it is disasterous now!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,R. Eric Witkowski,So many options. Delayed sending. Schedule messages. Pin messages. Rename groups. Multiple devices are just to name a few. There's a lot of options. Smooth running. So worth the one-time fee.,5

Edit: Keeping four stars and adding a comment about the inability (as far as I can figure out) to silence alerts while in a conversation. Seems to me that whether I'm on vibrate or even DND, the app still produces audible alerts when I'm actively conversing in a conversation.

I do have one request for fix/enhancement. How is the best way to go about that? Thank you soooo much!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Marko Milutinovic,"Giving 5 stars because other products are not even close to this set of features but in reality it deserves 3.5 due to bad implementation of web app. The problem is with dual sim cards, the web app does not have support for dual sim so it creates a lot of confusion when you text back and forth with your contacts. Needs work in this area to be a 5 star app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick Ferrer,I really like this app but lately I have not been receiving my messages or receive them late. Even worse when I'm a recipient of a group text I never see the group thread. I basically have to reset my default texting app to Android's messaging to retrieve all the missing messages.,3

I haven't really tapped into all of its features, but I like what I've seen/used so far. I've also tried the free subscription plan that allows me to use other platforms, but I decided not to continued with it due to the fact that if I don't have data coverage on my phone, then I can't use any of the other platforms. I'd love to be able to use this app across platforms on wifi but will use this on my phone for now.",4

The first time I tried Pulse it would not accept messages from my wife. After we got new, identical, phones I tried the app again and the issue has been resolved. The issue now is notifications from Pulse to my watch have become sporadic. Sometimes I get text notifications on my watch instantly, other times 3 or 4 hours after getting the message on my phone.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,C Miller,Pulse is actually a nice clean app. Have been using it for about a week now and thoroughly enjoy it.

I was so worried what to do so i searched on Google best alternative to default text apps and i found pulse previously the app was different name but i installed it and enjoying it its super smooth and super customizable . I liked the dark theme in it 😉 Loving pulse app and love to keep the pulse engine upgraded by updates .,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shawn Smith,"Has been mostly great but one serious flaw is the way it handles gifs. It can't send larger gifs, which OK fine that's typically of SMS, BUT it tells you that a gif has been sent when in fact it has not been sent. This is a serious issue since it creates communication issues in an app that is a communication app. I can't handle being told a message was sent when it wasn't. It at least needs to say that it wasn't sent.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Not does this app has redefined the we use messages, it also schedule's messages to be sent at a particular time, which native app cannot do. Theme for messages are pretty cool and I love the way I can customize. Best SMS app I have ever come across. 5 stars for the developer.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Devin Hawkins,Took a little bit more effort than I'd like for it to take but this app has capability like no other. To have my text messages on my tablet is amazing. The app works with no quirks. Functions as it is supposed to with the endless encryption. Very well done!!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Outstanding app! Features, performance, and support are all top notch. I've used Mightytext for a couple of years and enjoyed it. But, Pulse blows it away! Super easy to install, configure, and use! Nice work!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sunny Yang,Very nice app. I would give it a 5 but the windows version uses a bit of memory once in a while and freezes but ending the task and relaunch fixes it. Overall very good. I especially love that there are no annoying ads.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,this is such a great texting app. I love its customization. one thing I would like to change is to enable customized vibration for the pixel 3xl. I would like to assign it to different contacts! That's all I would like to see in the future for the app!!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,paul rich,I lost a long message today for no apparent reason so auto saving drafts would be good. I'm finding very frequent requests to upgrade Pulse to paid annoying. Generally the app works perfectly well but not sure it offers much that isn't available in free apps or default loaded on people's phone. Needs more wow,3

Hopefully there will be an update soon to fix the bugs.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app has been amazing on all my devices. Bought the one-time purchase the same night I installed it and have no regrets. Fast and easy to use, but rich with features and customization. Blows any other SMS messaging app I've used out of the water.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Former Google nightmare The messaging app on my phone was a joke from google. I could not schedule messages. Didn't download pictures. Too many things i couldn't do. Very frustrating. Finally found a app without ads. Been txting with family to make sure this was what I needed. I highly recommed this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,HKevin Paulson,"Unfortunately the app stayed in a perpetual stage of extracting my messages. At least that was what it said with the motion of downloading in place. And it forces one to make it the default messaging app. Can't access until compliance. I uninstalled after two hours with the promise of ""this should only take a few minutes..."" I'm just trying to find an app so I can leave group texts. Next!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Micah Lindley,"Pulse is by far the best SMS/MMS app out there. The only comparable app is Textra, which I found buggy and slow. Pulse's customization options are incredible, and the APN settings feature is perfect. 5 stars, would recommend. I've also converted my parents to this app and they love it too.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Marty Maney,So far it's been great. Simple but way ahead of stock app in flexibility. One con is that the color customization options for incoming and outgoing texts are limited. More customization options would deserve 5 stars.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Louis Marshall,"If the pulse app keeps doing pop up advertising stuff (upgrades, etc) I'm going to switch to another SMS app. You just confirmed your app is showing ads, whether they are Ada for your software or someone else's - an ad is an ad. I define an ad as text or graphics trying to get me to buy something",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Savannah DePriest,"I really like it. The only reason I left off a star is because it doesn't support all image and video formats. Ex: if you save pictures or videos from snapchat, you can't send it via pulse. That's the only downfall I've found so far.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I downloaded this app in order to customize my text notification ringtones. When I tried to do so, it told me that the native (Oreo) settings we're required and could not be overridden. That's the only reason that I tried to use this app. I'm uninstalling now.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I was looking for a way to send texts from a browser and this app has been great. The interface on the phone is smooth and functions very well. The browser version also functions very well. Definitely give this app a chance.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Kim Robinson,Things just keep getting worse. I've had this out for a long time. At least 3 seperate times the app resents several old tex msg to various contacts.

Then yesterday entire conversation history started dissapearing from various contacts along with any specifications I made for the individual contact.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really love this app, it does what it says 1st time every time and a lot more besides, the fact that I can create folders for my messages, archive them and leave my inbox clear is brilliant, that's why I bought the lifetime subscription on the first day that I downloaded this app, I have it on my phone, my pc, my laptop and my tablet as my default SMS app, a very well done on creating a wonderful app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really want to use and like this app, but the only notification customization is system level, which seems odd. I appreciate the dev's commitment to standards but I really would like custom notifications like I get in other text message apps, even ones built for Oreo and above. Specifically, custom vibration pattern like Textra has. It still obeys notification channels but somehow also offers custom vibration patterns.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Incredibly easy to use with lots of features! Convenient and quick to learn! I like it because I can text from any device I have. Makes much easier at my desk instead of getting my phone out all the time!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,omar h,I contacted customer service to ask if they will be having any promotion on there app for the holidays they said no upcoming deals. I went back to the app to purchase the lifetime subscription and the app jump from $10 or $15 to $31 after talking to customers service. No reply back from customer service on why the sudden changed. Now after my review it went up again to $46.99.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Absolutely fantastic solution to multi-device texting. Supports windows, web, and mobile interfaces; each one is consistently fluent, performant, and a pleasure to use. Plus it backs up all of my messages - - what's not to love?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Exactly what I needed! I was looking for a cross platform messenger that would allow me to text on my phone and tablet. This app works flawlessly tons of features but most importantly it just works. I live it and will tell everyone I know to switch to this messenger ASAP. Make the switch you won't regret it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joel Zimmerman,"This app is utterly useless! No matter how many times I come back to try it, MMS messages never go through. Even when I've granted to proper APN permissions. I give up on this app ever working properly. Every other Messaging app I've ever tried sends MMS jus fine, with thee exception of this one. Its really a shame, because the ui is so nice. But this app is just way too unreliabe, glichy, and riddled with issues.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian Scott,"I have been using Pulse for about 1 year now. My main use is to be able to receive & send SMS/MMS from my Win 10 PC, i.e. sync with my phone. To that end it works beautifully- pretty much instant syncing. Only problem I ever had was after a phone update that didn't turn Pulse back on - didn't notice at first and wondered what the problem was - so not the fault of Pulse :). What would be great enhancement would to be able to also auto forward to an email address. Why? Because there is no decent way AFAIK to back up SMS/MMS in a readable format on a desktop (Pulse only keeps a limited history). I have been using PhoneLeash for this for 10 months and it works great but I'd rather only use 1 app. You can manually copy and paste stuff from Pulse on the desktop but that is very clunky and slow. It surprises me that with with SMS/MMS being used so regularly, often instead of email, that proper backup / retrieval of SMS/MMS is only available on phones. Not much use if you want/need to collect emails, texts etc together in a folder! In other words, SMS/MMS has nowhere near the functionality of email. Since Pulse is already syncing with the desktop, my suggestion would be that the desktop app would be also able to optionally auto convert to an eml format using from/to info as the eml file name - and write this into a chosen folder. This would avoid Pulse having to forward the SMS/MMS to an email via the phone like PhoneLeash - although that would be nice. BTW, PhoneLeash costs about $USD5 per month, so there is an opportunity for Pulse to compete with an expanded product and make some revenue!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Josée Barton,I thought with a 4.5 rating and after reading a few reviews that it sounded a great app so I downloaded it. After two days it was still copying my contacts onto the app. Suddenly my phone won't turn on so I forced restart and deleted the app both on my phone and tablet. Not taking my chance on this.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Inconsistent and intermittently unreliable. Key texts to priority clients on iPhone frequently fail to send, but only sometimes notify me of such failures.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"App works great, I love that it syncs across multiple devices. I gave it 4 stars because it needs a ""like"" and ""dislike"" button for messages, similar to what iPhone has. This way Android users can start spamming iPhone users in the same manner. Example message when iPhone user hits the ""thumbs up"" button on a message, Liked : ""I'm heading home now"" These iPhone messages are beyond annoying and I would love to give them a taste of their own medicine. Will up to 5 star review if this occurs",4

This is really weird..",1

My carrier supports high quality video. my default messenger and google's Messages app both send high quality fron this phone and carrier (its what i use insttof this for video).

Allows you to automatically send longer messages as one MMS message, rather than randomly sent, broken into several chunks (a lil pet peeve lol 🤬)",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Notification sound cannot be customised. It says system-level notification channels must be used. So why isn't this requirement  applicable to other SMS apps where the ringtone can be customised? It is very important to me as I want to distinguish my SMS notification from other messengers. Not happy about it at all.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cindy Shewmake,I had to get a new phone and tried to install on my new phone and there is a bug or something because it will not import my messages no way to import them manually I cannot even set it up as the default messages and not even be able to transfer the messages to Samsung messages. I liked it up until this happened. Now I do not have any communication from my family in the last two days.,2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Alie Crehore,I have been using Pulse for messaging on my Google Pixel for 2 years now and I really love it! I also once reached out to the developer with a question and received a timely and accurate response. I really like the features such as private conversations and changing the colors.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"One of my biggest pet peeves is when apps nag me multiple times to rate them, and they always lose at least 3 stars if that happens. This app nagged me only once to rate it, but it promised that it would never nag again if I chose not to so I decided I just HAD to rate it at that point! What can I say more? This is a really good app that works well. I don't have to think about it, it just works. That's exactly what I want from a texting app. Thank you devs!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"worked great but later the loading screen loads slow and sometimes doesnt load at all, the screen when loading says something about another device when I just wanted to use it now, on my current device.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Ethan Anadon,Gifs have trouble interfacing with IPhones. I assume thats an SMS/MMS thing and not a problem with the app. Otherwise it was well worth the 10 or however much I spent on ot a couple yeara ago. No bugs to ote.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app but one thing is bothering me. When we receive spam messages, there should be an option to blacklist them by long pressing that conversation (like in Textra) instead of writing that number manually in blacklist tab.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Lane Anderson,"Used this mainly for it's multi-device SMS synchronization, and the fact that it's open-source. Last week, a company called ""Maple Media"" purchased this app. If you aren't aware already, Maple Media is known for buying previously-good apps and inserting ads into them, and I have no reason to think any differently about Pulse SMS. And now as of yesterday, the Github repo for Pulse SMS is no longer public (that was fast). That says a lot about where this app is headed, to me.

Unfortunately, I will have to uninstall. It's been several weeks after I paid for the full year membership. At this time, Pulse is not reliable for sending or receiving messages.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Ferri,"I've used this app probably close to a year and have come to rely on it for most messages. I especially like it's ability to make selected messages ""private"" and store them password protected in a separate location within the app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I came from Google Messages (Pixel's default app), which is riddled with bugs, and Pulse works wonderfully. It has a good-looking design, lots of useful features, and works without lag or bugs. Highly recommend it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryce Yates,"Great App, definitely worth the money. The sync between different devices is real-time and having all your messages sync down when you get a new phone is brilliant! Feature suggestion would be a notification delay for the desktop like discord and slack have.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Shnayder,Still the best in 2020. Great app. Well worth the full version to be able to text from the compute or tablet. Works perfectly. Went from Textra to using this and has a couple of features not in Textra plus the ability to sync,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank Spence,"Super full of features and plenty customizable. I only wish the syncing with the windows app was better. Carrying on a text conversation from my pc often winds up infeasible because something breaks down in the sync, and my texts stop sending.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really good app but when I'm in group chats it changes the message colors from people every time I open it. (Except for one old chat. No idea why it's consistent when nothing else is.) Please allow customization for specific people's message colors.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,tony karras,Overall the best one I have ever found most of these apps won't do that way you can see all your text messages on one app from multiple devices most apps again only allow single device however it is very perfect yet you still have to pay yearly a fee but it's amazing how you can view all your text messages on multiple devices I highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to see the text messages on multiple devices for Android,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse includes mini nice features, I can have a note to pop up from one phone telling folks to text me at a different phone number, at times it helps because I can't always carry two phones, also I was able to share one phone with the app on my tablet and when I'm connected to Wi-Fi I get text messages sent to my phone & on my tablet as well.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Siddharth Tyagi,"2 ultimate points for this app- ad free and sms blocker by phrase. Allows you to block sms from some spam sources which send the same message but from different numbers so that blocking one number wont be good. This feature is there in some other apps too, but they either have ads or need premium subscription. This is the only ad free app with this feature in my knowledge.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Useless app, doesn't work on WiFi. Pretty sure they harvest all preexisting text data upon install too. Edit: The reply is a lie. There's lots of free texting apps that work on WiFi and will send and receive SMS. TextMe for example. So what if it creates a number for you? That makes it even better.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Shockley,"Overall works well, sometimes it's difficult to delete messages and they immediately reappear. Sync with the desktop could be more dependable because it does not always stay up to date.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,D H,"I have this on my phone, my tablet and my laptop. It is so convenient not to have to have my phone nearby all the time. I can be working on the laptop in the den, while the phone is charging in another room, and never worry about missing an important text because it will pop up on the screen on the laptop. Or, if I am using the tablet and receive a text, I can respond using the tablet. This has got to be the best app out there.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I tried other text applications and so far this one is the best. Unlike the standard Messages app, this one handle photos much more cleanly. Unlike Textra there are no advertisements and you have much more control over responding to group text messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Benita Lamp,"Was happy with it at first, but don't get messages all the time in group texting, mainly from iPhone users, I have android. Frustrating!! UPDATE: Still having the same issues with this app not receiving group messages from iPhone users. Sent email several days ago and no response.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I really wanted this app to work. It works when it wants too. I miss way too many messages with this app and always have to go back to my native app to retrieve them. This is installed on a galaxy 9+ with the yearly subscription.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Hooten,"It took me awhile to get it setup correctly on my main phone (cell) and my work phone (tablet). Both are Android devices. Once it is working, it works well and is easy to use. I upgraded to the premium so that I could have more than one device.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Ghamaa,"I could rate 5 star, but the app misses some features like different fonts, control notification light, etc. Furthermore, the premium version is so expensive, I don't know if it considered the value of US dollar vs local currency in each country. Whenever you fix such bugs I will rate it 5. But generally the app is good.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,faizan,"The app has a very simple, cool and clear interface, i just like the animation and sending and receiving text with beautiful colors, still i haven't seen any errors, i can't give this app less then 5 starts.. Thumbs up and keep developing nice apps",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The app does well with text messages but for some reason it will not send attachments I have to use another app to send photos and links to videos. I've been using it for sometime I stopped using it and went back to using it. Cause of not able to share MMS.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Two Canines,Updated Review: Recently tried Pulse after dumping Signal. Used it two weeks. Have had one app update during my use. The app turns out to be incredibly unreliable with mms attachments. And no way to tell if your recipient didn't get it. That's just completely unacceptable in 2020.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,MikeMannZ,"Overall a great app, almost dumped it the other day because Chrome messed it up with their Android system webview. This was forcing it to close along with many other apps. The interface of this app is great I would take it over almost all of them!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Phil Crawford,"I have always preferred this app to Messages for SMS. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with security notifications from Amazon. Clicking on the link sent takes me to a failure page because this app hasn't passed the complete URL in the link.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Bought the lifetime on day 1.  Samsung watch app needs work.  E.g. Font too small and not adjustable and text entry is not the Samsung defaults.  Text of top post of incoming messages is cut off at the top corners.  Texts can't be initiated from the watch.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The app worked great for a while but then it started sending random pictures to random people on it's own. I deleted the app for fear it would send personal info out. I now use Android messages and it works much better than pulse paid app.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I want to like this SMS app, but after a few different times trying it there is a hurdle. I will frequently have people tell me they never received a picture I sent them. In the app the status will say sent. Submitted issue to tech support, but received no response.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kim,"I love this app. It's free, there are zero ads, it's quick, and I love the features. The links showing up as a preview with the image instead of a link is awesome. Definitely keeping this one.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Guerra,"Being able to read ALL of my past messages is a key feature for me and with Pulse I am able too. It's not as simple as flipping a light switch though, if you want your 20k plus messages imported you will have to do some digging, but for me I was able to get it working. This is one of the best SMS apps out there, my only nitpick is that if there could be simple way to import all messages that would be awesome!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Walter Swaim,Much better than Mighty Text and I still use Pulse. Only thing is I am a Premium member (purchased it) and over 2 years have reported frequently a couple of persistent problems in the app and have received no response at all but an automated reply. If not for that would give it a 5. No tech support for paid subscriber is a deal breaker.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Raphael Kepinski,"Read the fine print. If you pay for the life time license there's no 7 day tria,l you're stuck. Was hoping this would sync my texts with an old phone we have that just connects to wifi (it doesn't). Don't see the advantage over Google's messages app. Otherwise it's fine.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Wilson Bui,"Mr. Klinker has been great at answering questions when I've had them. Beyond that, I really like the Archive functionality and the backup and restore parts of the app as well. It helped me to survive times when my phone has died and I'd recommend this app to anyone who's got an Android!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I increased my rating for the fact that the devs are very attentive to reviews. I really appreciate it. However, that expansion animation is still the worst I've seen compared to Textra or even Android messages. The blank screen makes an illusion that the app is hanging even though it's not. Thanks again Luke for paying attention about it. I hope it can improve in the future.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,さぶりなSabrina,Theres a lot of amazing suff for this app but instead of just a slider for the primary color option being the color of all the contacts and stuff it should really ket you choose bc if you want it a different color then thats nice but also a soaecific ability to make different people different colors would be awesome (i often look over stuff so if its already there im just blind but i dont remember seeing it so),4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jon Barleycorn,I cant send videos. It says that it has already been processed. I have tried everything.. very disappointing after paying 11 dollars. It also crashes on the smartwatch and does not load fast. Still alot of bugs you need to workout.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,gregg wilson,I would guess I've been using pulse for three or four years now. Works great. Nice being able to write messages on a keyboard instead of just on a phone. Still here. Still five stars. Still syncs fine. No google eyes,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Seb Carroll,"Very good messaging app but not flawless. Seems to struggle at least initially when new contacts are added. Also the search function can be hit and miss, and glitches often happen when switching between menu items.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jessica Nitch,"I love this app..best messaging app out there..great customer service every time I needed help..i even became a lifetime subscriber..the only thing I would love for y'all to add would be to allow us to make our theme or bubbles with gradient color schemes..like purples that fade to pink, greens that fade to blue, orange that fades to red and of course there is many other gradient color variations like that..if you could add that it would be totally awesome ...thank you",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Special Paul,"Love the app, one time fee compare using Pushbullet. Web portal to sent SMS on your phone. The one missing star is because I'm unable to mark all message as read with a single click. (because I have a lot of 2FA SMS and I don't want to be bother to check since I already got the code through notification) I also love the messaging thumb image of the external link, and schedule SMS feature (replacing my tasker job). overall, if I can give an accurate score this is a 4.5 out of 5 - solid app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Nice alternative to the default messaging app. Allows the user to text from your computer, even if your phone isn't available. This feature alone is something every messaging app should have; that was the best feature of iMessage when I used an iPhone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's okay. I much prefer Textra. Pulse has some customizations that are nice, with great customizable colors. The emoji library could be better, like ios. The interface has a real Google feel, again it's okay but I'm not a Google zealot. Could be better.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse DAndrade,"Love the features to schedule messages, and use a few letters for shortcuts. Amazing. Even more options. You MUST EXPLORE When I update contact names, sometimes fails to synchronize. No problem. Just reinstall.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Been using this on my phone and laptop for a few months now. Its amazing - clean interface, not cluttered, lots of features that other messaging apps either dont execute as well or don't offer at all. Absolutely worth the lifetime buy!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tom,"Used to be great, but now when I get into the app it always has an ad right at the top for me to upgrade to ""Pulse SMS+"" taking up a lot of screenspace. I have got rid of it at least ten times now and it keeps coming back. Will uninstall if it continues.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark Lambeth,"Really great app for organizing my text messages. The only thing more that I would want from it is if it were to support RCS. I don't think that will happen anytime soon, but what it does with standard texting is superb!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Best messaging app I've used so far and that isn't completely riddled with ads. They have a paid version to unlock certain features beyond what you need it to do but the free version is great. Looks good too and is customizable,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick Nolen,Been using it for many years! Fantastic! The Chrome web app is great too. Very easy to sync messages and send messaged from the computer. Note that the Chrome app does this by sending and receiving messages through your phone.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I have way too many devices to sync and am always trying out new roms. This the best SMS app for those worried about losing their messages. I only had the trial subscription a few days until I realized I should just buy it. Thanks Luke.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Saitama San,"I really like this app but there are too many things that don't work. I can't send or receive MMS, even texts don't go through sometimes. Also i have tried every setting, but it will not use the sound for notifications.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Woebke,"I like that you can give names to group texts and if you delete a text you can immediately undo it. I can't give it five stars, though, because of the limit on the size of pictures and gifs you can send. You're not notified if a file isn't sent.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alan Ackermann,"Very simple interface and to the point. Additional options for Vacation/Driving mode useful as well. Would like to see option of listing my contacts by mobile phone only to simplify further, but overall I'm very happy w the app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really liked Pulse and it worked well for a long time. With my Nokia phone I do not get any group texts. For me this makes Pulse useless. Pulse says it is an Android problem and they cannot fix it, but the app that comes with the Nokia and the Google Messages app work just fine. Guess I will have to go with one of those instead. If the problem ever get fixed I would love to use Pulse again, but until that time I really cannot reccomend or use it.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,chanse starmer,"Its ok. It often fails to update properly that i received messages, for example ill have a notification of a text but the text doesn't show up in the app. Not as much control over conversations as i would like.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I started using this app when I got a Fossil Q Venture smartwatch and it is amazing! I did the free trial and soon recognized that it was more than worth the $10 lifetime membership. All my friends with iPhones are jealous of the color customization for my contacts. But what cemented my absolute love for this app is the ability to set up auto replies to individuals. Genius! I am enjoying Christmas break with ""out of office"" auto replies only going to work contacts and not to my friends.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app. Im a senior citizen and I was able to put this on my tablet and phone. Works like a charm. I had to update this review. I deleted this app because I thought I didn't need a texting app on both my phone and tablet....I was wrong. I was always worrying I was missing an important text..long story short, this is a needed app for anyone who has more than one device.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Favourite messaging app so far. I switched from android messages after they removed contact colour customizations and the widget. This app has both of those feature in addition to emoji customization, desktop sms, and message scheduling. I'm really happy with this app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great App, except for the fact that videos sent to me come in wicked grainy. Definitely the App as the videos come in perfect in other apps. Any recommendations would be helpful. Edit: Helpful feedback from developer. The issue is with the iPhone and not Android.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very rarely do i ever find, nor pay for anything that I have found on the playstore..but THIS being the exception, simply because it's just that good !!! I'm exhausted with hunting, reading and etc to find out if each application that I download will finally be ""the one"" app that will do what I want and need. Well this certainly seems to be it ! I downloaded this over a month ago and even as a free app, it pretty much had everything !!! GREAT GREAT job you guys !! Keep it up !",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daryl Wilson,"i'm only a basic user, i send a receive a few texts. my other messenger developed a problem communicating with the network to do that. with no other phone changes messages completed with pulse so my problem was solved. life is good. bit of an update... after some poor performance, i recreated an account, then i was able to reinstall and things seem ok again",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love the different colors for different contacts which you can customize. There isn't an annoying trial period like Textra which starts putting ads in your face. Also gifs work smoother than textra but they take a little long to load for some reason,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse pretty much gives you an iMessage type experience on your Android phone. You can message friends using any of your devices, laptops, whatever, all of your messages are there. Easy to use and about $10 to unlock all of the premium features for life. Highly worth the price.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Nice app !No MMS issues like many of the other 3rd party SMS apps.good customization ability, Friendly UI. Great developer response time. Request : please consider more settings for Auto Replies- like user chooses priority reply(s). And scheduled running times , and maybe workaround for RCS type messaging. I'd pay for it, sure others would also. 👍",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Almost perfect. Lacking conversation list customizations and a rounded bubble with no tail (different from circle with no tail). Those 2 things would make it perfect for me. Most SMS apps lack pretty heavily in the customization department though.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like everything about it. Except for one major problem that only happens with this app. I cannot send ir receive mms messages with only this messaging app. I have the correct apn set up in my phone, but the override still doesn't fix it.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Seems like a pretty great app, except I'm having one issue. I'm receiving text messages EXTREMELY late getting my wife and a few other people. My wife and I use Google Fi as our provider. It takes 5-10 minutes to get texts from her, regardless of what carrier I'm on and how his my reception is. Messages from some other people are coming through fine, as well as direct messages through Instagram and Facebook messenger. Seems to mostly be happening with Google Messages through Google Fi. Help :)",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I bought the lifetime subscription, it works well before, but after I uninstalled the app and intalled it back, it keeps on synching for 2 days now. I can see notification on my notification panel but when you open the app it only loads the optimizing page. Please fix this.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Seth Scott,"Love to be able to use this app on my phone and computer. Feel like sometimes it takes awhile for texts on computer to process, and then have issues with my contacts on my phone updating and showing in the app also. Otherwise I do like the app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Jaffe,"Excellent software. Being able to text from my computer has many advantages. The sync between computer and phone is outstanding. There have been occasional glitches, but nothing too serious.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ralph Williamson,"Not real enthused. A biggy issue for me... I have to open a text in order to black list. I want to get rid of unsolicited text's, spam,etc Without opening! In fact... I'd rather be able to not accept or spam solicited texts if the contact is not in my contacts list.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Was looking for a good third party SMS without ads or purchases, and this is the best one I've found. Clean, crisp, and very customizable, this thing has more features than I thought I'd ever need, and I use almost all of them.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Baril,"Excellent functionality and easy to use. Beautiful user interface. But, price is excessive... After using it for free for almost a year, I'm biting the bullet and coughing up the thirty bucks! Even appears to be developed here in Canada (well across the river in QC), so funding the local economy! 🙂",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,App itself is great but ... The mac client just quit working. It receives but will not send a message. I jave purchased the subscription even. My main reason for switching to pulse was to be able to send and receive messages on multiple devices.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,RSP,"Tried for a few hours. Oddly found very old text messages I thought were deleted. Then Pulse wouldn't receive incoming messages so had to uninstall. Cute interface, but since I can't count on it functioning had to get rid of it. May try again sometime.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sylvia Maike,"This is the most comprehensive text app I've ever used. After using it for over a year on just my phone, I bought the computer version, which is a bit wonky for me (I have Republic Wireless) but still useful. Pulse is definitely my favorite texting app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Myers,I needed an app to use my SMS service on multiple devices and this works perfectly. It even has Linux and MacOS versions. The most important thing is you can have it running on more than 1 other device without annoying requirement to reconnect. It beats Google Messages hands down.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Router,Keeps asking user to setup a pulse cloud account after i accidentally updated my previous version that was working fine during a phone swap. We dont want to setup any cloud account so stop asking us. I switched to pulse from textra after it started giving ads. Now i may have to switch again.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pretty awesome and clean. I like it. Dual sims are confusing, though. It's far from obvious of which sim card I'm using to send a message. The Sim # 1/2 is backwards and unlabeled in Pulse vs the rest of the whole android OS. Google messaging app shows my SIM cards properly.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Marshall Schurtz,"I've used Pulse for a few years and tried using ""default"" Google Messages again to get RTS. Pulse still wins out for stability. #1 thing a texting app needs to do? SEND AND RECEIVE TEXTS. Pulse never has these issues, while Google Messages does. Highest endorsement I can give.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"** Update** thanks to the developers help I was able to get all my messages. Just make sure you download the old version first, then set up an account, then update. Otherwise when you login it will go back to 500 messages.*** Love it! Geat app unfortunately it only backs up the last 500 messages, a deal breaker for me! Lots of good features though, very customizable. I'll definitely start using it once all my messages can be backed up! 😁",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Look for any other text app,this one is the worst I've tried by far. I've only tried about 3 features so far and it has failed on everything I've thrown at it. Firstly, sending a text did not work most of the time. Secondly, scheduled message did not work well at all. It did not even attempt to send the message until about 6 hours after I had set the time. And thirdly a friend tried to send me a picture but instead it made a group with me, my number and him. I recieve my own texts when replying.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sikiru Ade,"This is a five star plus app. The developer sincerely earned the top most rating. I downloaded tens of similar apps without getting full satisfaction. This app is so feature rich that the users are left to decide what to and not use. I'm still amazed at the size of the app vis-a-vis the rich features. For two sims phones like mine, I suggest the addition of sim ""ask first"" as an option in setting. I owe the developer this review in lieu of full purchase. Thanks. Blessings.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,R “Sonic007”,"App works fine. I just wish the delivery, and read notifications worked. They are very important to me. Edit to answer response from developer.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Richard Berkley,Schedule messages is key. Integration with Android share functions is unparalleled by other messaging apps. Seamlessly works across all devices. I don't think I have a bad thing to say about this app. Thrilled to use it as my primary SMS,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pro: Naming group texts feature is what sold me on this App. Con: I prefer the look of Verizon's text bubbles. They use more of a lasso or outline, rather than a solid color. Overall though this is the nicest messaging App that I've tried.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a pretty solid messaging app. What it does, it does well. However, it lacks a lot of the customizing functionality found in other top tier apps I've used. Overall, I'd rate it 3.75, rounded up to 4.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent app thus far. Long term user of ""Textra"" but left that app after battling with increasingly annoying and pervasive advertisements. Pulse is a joy to use. Extensive customisation options. The ""Private Conversations"" feature, secured in my case by biometric recognition, is very useful. The only reason for 4 Stars instead of 5 Stars is the poor level of SMS meta data regarding Sent, Delivered and Received status. My previous app, Textra, provided much better information in this regard.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,K B,"I bought this primarily to allow me to SMS from my PC/laptop. In the main it works, and some earlier niggles have been fixed so have increased rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. Dev is responsive to feedback. Wishlist: 1. Contacts sync on PC needs to be more seamless.",4

Even on its own as a free app it's much better than whatever garbage stock Android is using these days.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Leigh McBain,"I like the app in general, but the way they have it setup to reset a forgotten password is not impressive for a service that clearly does have a server involved and synchronizes new devices based on user id and password, do resetting a password shouldn't be a big deal.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,SeiRruf Wilde,This is a fantastic battery saving non-google alternative to Android Messages! I really hope to see even more features in the near future :D Feature packed apps are with every cent. Perhaps a better image compressor for MMS would be nice.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,only because its hard to see phone numbers of contact especially if they have more then one number. also when doing schedule messages can't send pictures schedule also. takes a hit of getting use to this app. But I do like it.,4

Maybe some minor ""bugs"" here and there, but nothing that hasn't been worked out with updates provided regularly... sooo can't complain! :)",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ken Bukowski,It's better than most message apps but I can't give it 5 stars because you can't send pictures or GIF images. I also couldn't figure out how to send texts with a 5 digit numbered recipient. Sending images is a fun part of texting. Why was that feature omitted.,3

It has already saved me a ton of time. (recent) After 3 years of a lifetime membership, I was told that I had to pay (again) to upgrade to features I already had paid for (what?). I brought this to the attention of Maple customer service and they said this was their mistake and corrected the problem quickly and responsibly. It looks like Maple (the new owner) is honorable and trustworthy. In a world full of the contrary, this is a cool fresh breeze. Thank you.",5

Frustrating.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,calvin henn,I used the Pulse SMS app to replace the stock Samsung one because I was having trouble with sending emoji. Not saying the Samsung one is bad. With Pulse I have choices that suits me and lots of colours with individual contacts and decent updates with good features. I only gave four stars because I haven't explored all of Pulse as yet..,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris,"UPDATE AGAIN: Latest update broke images again. can't see images in my text strings now. Just stop. Bring in Klinker to fix this then walk away. Stop breaking the app! UPDATE: For those unable to send images after the last app update: I uninstalled/reinstalled and signed back in. Still couldn't send pics. So, that wasn't too helpful. I went through the forgot my password annoyance that actually deletes and recreates your account. After I did that, I could send pics, but this also wiped my message archive. So, BEFORE DOING THIS step, open your native text app and let it sync all SMS. That way you can use the Sync system SMS messages within pulse to get ALMOST all of your messages back. Problem solved...mostly. I Raised my rating to 3 because at least I can go back to using it now. The future will see if it can be (mostly) problem free again. I miss Luke Klinker, but hey, we can't go back in time. New developer, please do your best! ______________________________________________________________________ Everyone is having issues since it was sold to the new company.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Melissa Major,"I would give it 5 stars, but this app, just as the original Motorola supplied app, refuses to allow any message over 160 characters to change over from SMS to MMS WITHOUT breaking apart and looking retarded... Unlike the BUILT-IN text messaging app supplied by SAMSUNG! If they can do it with the SAME ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM why can't y'all??!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Biff Van Cleve,Much better than the standard Android messaging app. It has an auto response feature but apparently it is either on or off rather than being activated by the GPS. So for me that is basically useless.,4

I tried to send my first message and it would not send. No reason as to why. I was even willing to pay yearly. No choice of font or size or color. There was nothing fun about it........... I did install on both my phone and tablet, and it still is not as fun to use. Font only had a choice of size. I consider this not user friendly. Not too much to personalize either.",2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Travis Carter,Navigation isn't excellent. Often multiple selections are required to switch from normal to private text lists. Sometimes bio doesn't work and then you have to enter the passkey twice to get to private. Seems pretty basic for that ux to be so broken,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"My main SMS app right now! I love the integration between my devices. It's the best third party app for android equivalent of imessaging right now.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Casey James,Can't send files over 10mb which is pretty low. Most short 10 second video clips are about 20mb so it makes this app pretty useless when sending videos to one another. This app is good however because it has a widget and Google Messages doesn't.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I was very happy to finally find an app that would actually send a scheduled message. this one has worked every time. I also like how the color background changes between day and night. I highly recommend Pulse SMS.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,What I like about yhis spp is its simple straight up but still with fun and useful features not on the stock Samsung messages spp or any of Googles failed messaging apps. I love hsving timed delayed text messaging. Yhe only problem Im having is this will not sync with my Samsung Gear watch at all because Samsung is trying to force people to use their apps only. Also there's a slight problem eith Android Voice Assitant integrating with this app but I believe its because of Google's AI Update,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've been using Pulse SMS for a few years on different phones and I love it. I wish there was an option to back up texts though without paying a monthly fee. Even just a local backup would be good. Other than that 5 stars!,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jessica Yock,"I love all the features this app has, like scheduled messages, being able to organize you contacts and it has been running very smoothly. Worth the $10 lifetime fee for someone's who uses texting for business and personal.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bhushan S,"Amazing app. This app should be shipped with all android phones. Its better than many more out there. I have just 1 problem here. I have changed a name of contact, but in pulse it still appears with same old name. I tried clearing cache but it didn't worked. Many thanks,",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Needed a messaging app with a dark theme, this looked like it suited down to the ground... Other than the frequent crashes, and the £50 of MMS charges that I knew nothing about, no option to avoid sending long messages as MMS instead of multi-part sms Do not install unless all your messages involve max one or two characters 😠😠😠",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cameron Thomas,"Got it primarily for the scheduling capability, but I have come to use the privacy features as well. Work very well on most counts. If the random grouping of group texts gets worked out, I would readily give it 5+.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Messages are disappearing after a day! What's with that??? It does not have deletion turned on in Advanced Features, and so far it is only deleting certain conversations, not all of them. Any suggestions would be welcome.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A very nice, customizable app - only reason it's not 5 stars is because the Desktop app doesn't have any option to auto-lock after x time or unlock with pin which presents a bit of a security concern. If that feature gets added I'll have no problem with it at all 👍",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love everything about Pulse, except the issue you sometimes face of sending / receiving video and the quality of the video. I've read numerous chats as to why that is and possible fixes, but still the issue exists. I'm a Verizon customer with the new Google Pixel 4, so if anyone has any insight or resolution on this please enlighten me. Still a (5) star app in my opinion, but really wish there was a way to remedy the video thing",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Good app. I like it, mainly like the widget part of it. Maybe it's just me but it's hard to find the sounds part in the app. I'm trying to have my text as a different sound than my phone's notifications.",4

Just could you please add a feature that we can put more than one conversation in the private conversation folder instead of going in each one and doing it like that. That would be great!! Other than that, keep up the good work!",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Even if this app is really good I'm inclined to ditch it because I'm not sure it works? My provider registered over 5000 sms's sent last month (20-30 during less than 10 minutes; no dups received). I have no way tracing the error. The phone company can't check the contents due to data protection laws (GDPR). I have no way accessing Pulses raw sendlogs thus left me paying over €700 since they where to an international contact (local Sms's are free of charge up to 10k/month and not specified).,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Philip Ely,Thanks to Pulse I was able to recover all the messages I lost from my phone after I hard-reset it. Great to be able to use it on my PC too. I haven't yet had the opportunity to explore all its features but what I've seen so far is good.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Ideas are great but function with other devices is very poor and rarely functions. This could become an awesome product if problems are resolved. I purchased 2 lifetime licenses. I believe in the future of this product but frustrated now.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app is a big improvement over the default SMS client app that comes with the Samsung Note 9 phone. I paid for the multi-device feature and it really works well and syncs my SMS messages across all my devices. Well worth the cost!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Attractive and comfortable UI. Multi platform notification is the major reason I paid for the app and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. Notifications are always instant. Overall a great upgrade from default messages.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Unreliable; Messages Frequently Not Sent From Phone or Received From Others.

Also it does t allow configure the display name for the Sim card. For the 1st sim it shows the number and for the 2nd it only says sim2. Also would like to see setting to enable split long sms to standard length (still needed in some situations)",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Just downloaded app so still evaluating, just fancied a change from the brilliant textra, one thing I've notice straight away that would massively improve this app, as with textra, delayed sending should be overrode and sent immediately with a double tap of the send button",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This has to be the worst app I've ever downloaded and the most expensive! it has never worked correctly. 3 or 4 days after paying for it I requested my money back, but never got the credit. So over this last year I have tried to load it several times to see if any improvements have been made, which none have been added. I have missed many messages using the app. A couple contacts never worked. Pictures almost never send or receive. It would be a great app if it worked! Waste of money!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Improve contacts sync it'll be five stars. I will be happy to pay twice the current price then. Edit: What I want to see is auto contacts sync/pushing (once a day?) or an easier and smoother manual contact sync in Pulse for web. I've now switched to stock google message. They have messages for web now with much better contact reading & sync.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Raza Zaidi,The main reason of sharing is shifting to Pulse from my default SMS app was that it provided the opportunity to simultaneously send SMS to my Samsung Tab S7 However this function is a hit and miss. Sometimes I get message on the tab but about 40% of the time messages are missed on the tab So my 3 starts only till this is perfected,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Naser Padar,"After transferring your messages to the server they get encrypted so if you change or reset your phone, they wont open unless you install this app again (shown as blank MMSs inside phone's own message app). fortunately I had backed up my message before installing.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Colin Smythe,Not as much customization as Textra but it does really well with cross platform texting. If you just have a phone or only use your phone to text then Textra is the better option in my opinion. This is a solid texting app overall though.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alber Soomro,"Very very very Disappointed, I requested a long ago, I even mailed and was assured feature will be fixed in next update but it didn't but I again mailed yet it didn't. I was told alternative but simple fix/feature was not added.

Some features I have found very useful are -Well designed scheduled message sending - A time delay after you press send in case you made an error -Cross platform (Web, Tablet, PC) SMSing.

Have since been successful in loading app on all my Platforms and couldn't be happier; thanks Luke.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tim C,I like this app better than the stock app on my flagship LG. I send a lot of group texts to customers and they can't see the others in the group. I can't turn off Group MMS in the stock app but Pulse works beautifully. I only noticed one problem with Pulse. I tried to send a screenshot but it didn't work after several attempts. I use the stock app for screenshots now. Not a big deal and not worthy of a reduced rating but it is worth noting. I am very happy with Pulse.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love the app bc I can use it on all my portable electronics. The only reason it isn't a 5 is that I can't use it on my desktop computer. When I'm at my desk, I have to also have a portable device on hand to read and answer texts. Using a real keyboard would make it so much easier.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Currently using this app on a Samsung note 9. Great app I love the convenience and it's user interface. I recently had a small problem.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Hands down the best alternative to iMessage on the android/pc platform. The ability to log into a website and text from there is super convenient. I wish there were some mote advanced features like customization and supporting various attachment.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dana Jeffries,Great app. These days there's the security checks where a code number is sent to your phone. Of course that's sent to the phone and I'm sitting at my desktop and have to grab the phone and type the number sent in. It's nice being able to work with SMS messages on my desktop.,5

Sorry, but, I'm parting ways from an app that I once enjoyed using for many years.",1

I guess it is a different view point, you think 3 weeks is fine, I find it very annoying. As for an honest review, Pulse does everything I ask of it and it appears to really be ad free. The fact that the developers read the reviews and answer is pretty good too. Other than my pet peeve about begging for ratings Pulse is a very worth while SMS app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Merman oftheSea,Awesome! Works great! I've had this app for a few years now. I can text across all of my devices seamlessly. A glitch there and now but nothing out of the ordinary. You may think it a bit plain but it's really not. I'd buy it again for sure,5

I just want to say to the makers of this app please keep doing what you're doing and I hope it gets better from this point on.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,C,My biggest complaint with this app is that you cannot send images/videos without them becoming a pixelated mess. Lower than 180p resolution. My two smaller complaints are: (1) For some reason I stopped getting text message notifications. (2) Everyday it asks you to subscribe to premium.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I moved to Pulse from Textra, the PC application can use a little work to make it smoother, but this is the best app overall. It's almost as nice and smooth as Textra, and has the PC features of Google Messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Howard Burleigh,"Way more features than the default Google messaging app. Plus it's not made by google 👌😁 But seriously the app has been reliable and with the cheap Pulse SMS+ subscription I get a native Windows app. It even let's me choose to copy part of a message in the main android app, which is nice.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Theophilus Thomas,It's a great app. Great even that we can use wifi and not use our data. I give it 4 stars in that I was really looking for sms with free text templates to save time in texting particular people. Hoping that will be in a future update. Still a good app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Top quality stuff, scheduling functionality in particular is A+. If there are any ads, I haven't noticed them. Very smooth experience. Reinstalled right away when I got a new phone",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Loving this app! I have had several other SMS apps that all have major shortcomings. This one has it all. I was having trouble with one feature, I emailed the developer, and he helped me figure it out. Five stars!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,KOBRA Organization,"I was recommended this app and I had it for all of a minute and 45 seconds before it was deleted. In general, any app that makes things more complicated is outted from my phone. This was one of those apps for me. ...Doesn't mean it won't work for you, but it was ""SUPPOSED"" to work for me and it didn't.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ed Mak,Great app. Bought the full license to have updates on ny watch and web access. I wouldnonly request a few options (phone and web). Ability to switch from group to individual message while keying the note. Similar to verizons message+,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Not recieving push notifications/""security codes"", 'pins'. Yes i havd checked settings, preferences & permissions numerous times. If it had blanket compatibility & was without such issues i would definitely use always. Kinda keep back burner & use default SMS because of that. FIX PLEASE",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very good. WHAT I WISH IT HAD: When sending multiple pictures, it sends each as an individual message. I want to send an MMS with multiple pictures attached, like most other messaging apps.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lori Smith,"Used this as texting app for the last 2 years, but now when app or program sends me security SMS to verify account etc. The text doesn't come through. Found myself switching sms apps when needing to get codes. Tires of doing that I've changed sms app. Was worried other texts aren't coming through either. Galaxy S9",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mario Machado,"I keep seeing reviews around the web about this service only costing $10.99 for life, but I downloaded the app and it says it costs $59.99 for life! That is just too much for an SMS replace for Android Messages. I cannot find anything online about the change, so the seeming price change in app sucks.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I text as many as 185 people in a group. Pulse works flawlessly on these mass texts. Delayed send, scheduled texts work perfectly, too. I haven't had any issues with this app - I love it! Highly recommended.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Venkat Mylavarupu,"After using this and many others....not impressex at all. Basic features like repeat notifications limit, popup on lock screen, etc missing. I used the paid version and even then not much customization available....not enjoying this app at all",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tony G,"The best messaging app I've ever used, and I'm usually picky. My only suggestion is that it would be nice to have more customization like being able to change the wallpaper for each individual person you text.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Diana Hoover,"When I imported my text messages into the pulse app, the messages I sent didn't come along. The text strings that migrated over included only the messages sent to me. Otherwise, the app seems to meet my needs fairly easily.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"iI like most of the features, but it suddenly stopped sending notifications that a text had come in. The written notification was there, but no sound. PITA. I'm looking for something else right now.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tiffany,I really like this app but lately it freezes and crashes if I try to send a pic. This never used to happen but now it seems like almost every time I send a pic it freezes the whole phone and then marks the pic as sent but the receiver never gets it. Please fix,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The absolute best texting app. It is worth the premium subscription. I can text seemlessly from my computer and I have an automatic backup. I would never switch.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"My complaint: ""no way to prevent text messages from popping up in a mini window when using the phone. I have to close mini-Pulse, open big Pulse and navigate to the appropriate conversation."". Klinker says it's not the app. Well, honestly, it's such a cluster-mess out there in Android land that it's impossible to know who screwed the pooch so I guess everything is just fine and no one is responsible for anything. It's all good. Here's 5 stars. I'm outta here.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dawg Dew,"Great program, love it! Very dependable and easy to use. The only thing really on my Wishlist would be if I could ""lock"" certain texts to prevent me from accidentally deleting them!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,tension,I love pulse! I use it to text from all my devices and it works perfectly. It's always the first app I install. Great work devs! *Edit* 2 years later after my first review and it's still amazing! Never any issues with updates or new versions of Android. Thank you devs!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Works great most of the time and finally found a reliable android text messaging app that also supports messaging from desktop. Sometimes on desktop it doesny send but it happens very rarely that I don't mind.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app with excellent features, but I wish it had the same ability to report spam as the default messaging apps. If it does, it's not as easy to find/accessible.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Thomas,"DO NOT USE THIS APP Now this POS app is transferring a message to one individual to a group chat the one individual us a member of. People noe see messages not intended for them due to this POS app. Notifications stopped working. Check and setting are correct. App software version is current. Followed all of the normal solutions, still is silent w no notifications.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Aquino,This is by far the best messaging app that i ever used.. has theme modification and i love it. has no ads.. no need for subscription though there is also an option where you can subscribe to help the developer for more features.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Carly Oskroba,I only downloaded this as it would work with my Samsung watch and allow me to keep other keyboard features. Lately messages won't send the first time and I have to constantly resend. I paid for the lifetime plan and expect it to work right.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,N H,"I have to clear the app out a lot. when hitting the back button out of a conversation thread to go to the screen that shows all of your conversations, it will show literally nothing and freeze. Also, I glady paid for the full version of this a year or two ago for like $12. They are now making you pay $100. What a joke. I would definitely not support that bs. Scam is a better word actually. The only thing I believe has been added since is a ""reminders"" feature. Devs should try to justify that.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matthew Nerz,"Lots of functions somtimes texts for you 🙂. Solid 4 Edit; it seems to grow top heavy. The functions less-ised are there and working. I use a couple of good features. It's not your critical go-to. It's not spoda be. Update; the developer wrote back. App developers find 50 different ways to say 'Sorry, but you shouldn't be allowed to use a phone'! 95% of the time they are right. You just don't say it aloud.These guys didn't. See below. I respect that. 4🌟⭐⭐⭐",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Dougherty,Pulse does everything I wanted that my less expensive new phone doesn't do. Makes me feel like I still have a top line phone with every feature for texting. Best additions for me with Pulse: Scheduled text sending and Repeated new-text- arrived notifications. Great App!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael S,"It will delete large text conversations without notification. I had a text chat going for years with my wife, decided to restart my phone, and pulse just decided to make the texts disappear for no reason. There is no way to get it back so thanks for being a garbage app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"some font colors are wrong so settings can't be seen without highlighting them. i need to be able to customize notifications based on message content, which this app doesn't do. looks nice otherwise.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jimi Mack,Very pleased with this app. Clean design with nice options. The only option I would like to see is the ability to change the colors on the message fonts. And how the heck do you set up dual sims in this app?,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is the greatest app! I love the ability to schedule a text to be sent at a designated time, late night work; schedule to go @8. Ability to save texts and there are NO adds!!🤸💃 Great app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Chong,"Best feature is the ability to schedule a message at a specific including a repeating (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) option. Perfect for those phone musters.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Phillip “Odd Market” Dane,By far the BEST sms app out there. I've tried them all. Must be at least 25 apps tested and none are as stable and easy to use. The desktop app sync is flawless as well! Great job.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dan Bedard,Pulse is way better than the built in Android messages. Its web interface is superior. Being able to archive conversations is super helpful for staying organized. And delayed send has come in handy several times.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It sometimes loses texts, across the platforms, and doesn't play great with Android Auto, but it does have features that have come to find indispensable such as scheduling messages and the imperfect multi-platform usability.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A great solution that operates like iMessage (MacBook/iPhone)... texts on every device stay synched with one another. Great feature if you want to silence your phone while working on your computer/tablet, etc. and respond via the Chrome extension.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Doesnt work like half the time I send a message from the chrome extension, go to see why ive had no reply only to find the message didnt make it as far as the handset and no indication in browser or otherwise that it wasnt sent. Unreliable!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank Man,"My favorite for SMS. Some of my friends are now using it from my suggestion. Only thing I don't like is occasionally deleted and archived conversations reappear in current conversation list. No big deal, just another swipe.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Digital Trucker,So far so good. Not as good an SMS app as I was using before (Textra) but I needed the Windows application to work and this one does (previously used MightyText but it became sporadic in functionality). So far (a week or so of use) Pulse does the job.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Douglas Underhill,"Good overall, lost points for no ssl when sending and receiving, unlike Signal or Google Messenger latest iteration which both integrate SMS and encrypted messaging. Reply: I feel I was pretty clear. You encrypt the data store but exclusively use plaintext SMS. Supporting the RCS-UP protocol would be a good step if you don't want to run your own messaging servers. Google uses both their own servers and RCS. Of big 3 in US, only ATT has no RCS-UP support. 2. Yeah you'd need to build yourown.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far so good... This app is absolutely amazing it does everyone I need and it also have a private seeing, just what I was looking for... I've tried mood SMS and it was great up until the latest update with the ads started moving show but this this app is so smooth and fast I have paid for Textra and I'm not using this 1.... Keep up the good job stay and free and keep making this app way better than what's out there....",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I got this app for it's scheduling feature. Love that it allows me to schedule repeated messages and it keeps all scheduled messages together. Also enjoy the color options for all messages and contacts.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Using Sony Experia ZX2 compact, I find the Pulse app very useful. I can choose a max size limit for MMS which I cannot do otherwise.  However there are some problems.. When people send me MMS, I get those in a group message with 2 recipients. sender and ME, and when I reply from that group thread, I also send to myself, which I find very awkward.. Why can't MMS be recieved as a single recipient thread ??. It should be fixed.  Also- every time I recieve an MMS, my service provider doesnt seem to know that I am actually getting the MMS, so they send me links for website where I can see the MMS. So it seems Pulse app does not tell service provider that I actually recieves the MMS..  Otherwise good app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,wolfgang lawrence,"could use a few upgraded features I logged but generally good. two examples: needs to save not erase content if screen orientation changes. desktop app needs way to show sms from date x to z, multi-select and copy with date/formatting.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan Saunders,"Great feature set, and if you buy the upgrade, you can sync messages across devices (no more losing stuff if you break your phone), and also send texts from your PC. Wyith it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel M Kirimi,"I use Pulse SMS after reviewing a number of SMS Apps. Its the best with lots of great features like private conversations, archive, folders among other. However I am unable to send messages using SIM2 of a dual SIM phone",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Nice app. Good customization for free. But when I leave the app open and put my phone to sleep, when I get more messages the notification never goes off. I could text someone, and never hear the response because the app was still open",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like the app itself.. however, the inability to lock individual messages within the chat is quite a simple feature to be lacking, which I would use often. I may have to switch to a new app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Trenton Burton,It's great for the web app. Love the texting capability between the phone app and web app. Falls short on mms though. People rarely seem to get any photos/memes I send. Would be 5 star if not for that.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Started off really liking this app. Mainly drawn to it for the ability to schedule outgoing texts. But since this week's update on its web platform, the syncing has been very spotty.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Katie Hamilton,I missed sooooooo many text messages with this app. When i switched back to my old one i had about 15 messages i never got. Only had the app for about a month. I also could not send pre recorded videos from my gallery i HAD to take the video via the app to send. Will not recommend ever.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matthew T,"Great alternative to the stock app, but some additional features would be nice, such as being able to choose the color for the notification icon (on compatible phones), & a custom sound for the repeating reminder of an unread message.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is really good! iMessage completely blows Google messages out of the water, but this is a quality Android alternative. Great controls and very customizable. Interface is clean, and works great, with no ads🙂 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim VZ,So far so good. Had it a week. Ditched the app after a couple of months. Was not getting text. Also had problems with texting to and from multiple parties. Wish it would work!!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Needs option to rename ""Private Conversations"" to something else or to hide that folder by long pressing something. Kinda defeats the purpose of keeping conversations discrete. Mood Messenger has a very great way of doing it.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Drake Dragon,"Edit: notification still plays over itself BUT if you swipe closed the app (droid user) it does stop the sound. Color coding convos could be better too. I like the dark themes (migraine sufferer) but I can't change the color of my text, it's black on black with white letters. Just annoyingly boring.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app a lot but recently notifications started acting weird, whenever I set a custom notification app-wide rather than per contact, the app ignores it and just plays the system's default notification sound. Odd.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,BigHenFor,"Pulse is a comprehensive SMS & MMS app that allows you to send messages from your phone and computer, and manages your messages on your phone and computer. You can also archive or delete read messages. It's simple to use, and has no ads. I have no reason not to use it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Zach Stanley,"There are some things I wish this could do; more options for auto responses, for example. All in all a good app. I like the message scheduling. By far the worst thing about it is being asked to rate it all the time...so here you go!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great messaging app, though I would like to be able to set the default folder view and to be able to have folders with the private messages area. Overall, a good SMS app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Hopkins,"So far I have no complaints. It does everything that I want it to do, including pinned messages and scheduled messages. Group messages and large MMS messages format correctly and it's easy to navigate.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,its been very easy to use. the app has much more functionality than a lot of the other text message apps. certainly way better than the standard one given with your phone. well worth the download. i highly recommend using Pulse.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Deepak Gupta,"Nice application. Can you consider adding the application settings and the list of spam backup option to the local device and OneDrive? Additionally, a new swipe action to add the message sender to the blacklist.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gidi Est,"Dual sim support is now a paid feature :( Edit: tried on other phone, dual sim worked, guess Xiaomi had issues on dual sim support. @_@ 2nd edit: It was the Xiaomi's privacy setting, that is returning blank messages when the app tries to get the device info in the app's Permissions, allowing the app to get the full info instead of blank messages resolved it. 👍",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Edit: Gave this app another try.... so far so good ... minimalist approach. ----------- Old Post: This makes the System UI crash everytime. have to pull the battery from phone to recover. paid for lifetime subscription... maybe they'll fix down the road.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Panagiota Petris Razzano,"Right now I'm pissed! I can't get into the desktop portion of the app. I paid, twice now apparently; I should be grandfathered in from the first time I'm told. Whatever the case, I reached out to support and they were going back and forth with me at lightning speed, but only half reading the context of my email which detailed the issues. They kept asking me for info I already gave them! After the 3rd time, I said something and they've been silent since - left their paying customer hanging! 😡",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,JP {Crazytekkie} (Crazytekkie),"Was better than most messengers and offered many features others dont. Unfortunately it has had a few substantial glitches lately. As long as this one keeps up all the good stuff and doesn't make stupid changes, I'm a user of this app permanently. Nice job...

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app...If I could change it or suggest anything it would be if I could customize my settings and look on my tablet and it not change on my phone, and also I would like to be able to see which devices use the app more and click on it to get more details",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've used quite a few messaging apps in the past but Pulse has been the best to date. Texting from my computer just *works* and it's got just the right amount of customization and options.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Richart,"I wish I had never used and paid for! this app. I've noticed that I was not getting the response I expected when I sent messages. I installed the Google message app and saw that there were dozens of messages that were never even sent! Many of these were really important. Pulse never gave a clue that these messages were NOT SENT! These things matter. A lot! So, even though I PAID for this, I'm uninstalling it right now. Avoid this app! It will cause you actual grief. Much hurt to loved ones.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have used Verizon Text messages for 20 plus years. over the past year I have not been getting my alerts. I tried several times to uninstall/ reinstall the message app but no luck. After reading Verizon's reviews this seems to be a common issue. I installed Pulse SMS. I will try for 30 day, if I like it I will purchase. I gave a 5* rating because it is user friendly. Does this have read receipts??",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Ali Baba,I've been using Pulse for more than a year and it's been doing everything I needed without fail or complaint. I'm usually very critical of IT and in the case of Pulse I've nothing to pick at. Excellent product.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app. Only missing feature is the ability to search on partial sender criteria and mass delete. I need this to quickly delete all my daily calendar notifications that are also texted to me.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Absolutely golden! I love the scheduling messages feature! Tracking groups, custom colors for each contact, private messaging, beautiful UI, and simple and easy to use. Couldn't be happier!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bill Artemik,"This is the sms app I was looking for! Works on my cell phone and for $20/yr it works on my PC, too.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris C.,So far the app seems good. A better alternative to the samsung msg. It would be nice on the nest update to have more custom editing with contacts and support for higher resolution video when sending to contacts.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,jaquez carter,Paid for app originally when it was only a $5 one time payment but now it's forcing a monthly subscription which sucks and it also needs foldable phone/tablet support.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app! I picked up a subscription and will make this my primary SMS app. That said, I'd really like to see an easier way to input emojis. I can use GBoard to send them, but the attachment button doesn't show emojis as an option",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Not what I was looking for apparently. Disappointed that this app is NOT free to use on multiple devices. You don't find that out until AFTER you've downloaded it. :( Updated review: I was incorrect that the description doesn't tell you multiple device use isn't free. Yet, you have to search for that info as it's all the way at the BOTTOM of the description when it should be at the TOP near the name. Google needs to fix this showing as a free sms app in search. Not all msgs show either.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian Saghy,"Was dropping lots of texts, incoming and outgoing. No idea my texts never sent till later - or somebody would suddenly receive it after a phone reboot. Nags to upgrade. Has nice features but if it's not reliable what's the point?",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,SuShI NOM Waffle,"Smooth and pretty but when I'm texting on my tablet it takes FOREVER to send and sometimes just... doesn't. Also you know what would really make me love this app, if you had a typing and seen signal. Until that happens I'm going back to my normal messenger, which just got that, and Instagram. I like to see that they've seen my messages and that they're replying and I'm sure a lot of other people would too. Please consider it, I'm starting to regret paying money for this.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,brilliantly elegant in its design. Works perfectly. Makes your android phone work as smoothly as an iphone. When I leave my phone at home I can still send and receive text messages using my office computer. Works so well Google should buy this app and make is a standard component of android.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gloria Paculan,"Recently got a Samsung S21 Utra 5G.... and for some reason I haven't been getting all my messages or won't receive my message at a later time.

What happened? Or how can that problem be resolved?",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Colin Rimmer,"If user chooses not to permit Pulse to make phone calls, the app gets stuck in an endless loop, repeatedly asking user to agree access to contacts and messages every time they hit send to deliver a text.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Essie Wright,"This is a great app, the only issue I am having is that in group messaging, the replies are coming in a separate message so I don't know what some of the replies are to.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app works perfectly as described. Google message: I could access messages from my galaxy note 10+ phone and web page on any computer, but not on my galaxy active 2 watch. Samsung message: I could access messages from my phone and watch, but not from a web page or computer. Pulse SMS allows me to access my messages from phone, watch, and any web page. This is perfect for my work situation and exactly what I was looking for. The set up is easy and straight forward: download and set up the android app on the phone, follow the instruction to register an account on pulse sms website, download the pulse sms app from galaxy store to the watch, login using the same account, and all set. Messages are synced instantly and consistently across all platforms. The only suggestion is that: typing up the account and password on the small watch screen is a tedious process. It would be easier to allow user to create a one-time access code from the web/phone account and use it to login on the watch.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Wow! This is AWESOME! I used to use Allo app for Google but that will no longer be working anymore then I used the Standard Android message app and have had so many issues with it, so I come across Pulse and its GREAT. Free on your phone but to use for other devices you pay for it but its WORTH IT. You can turn some sensitive conversations to Private with a passcode on it.  So far I am really LOVING this app and I highly recommend it.  Thank you, Luke!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Found this app to use compatible with verizon SMS+ (default verizon messaging app) is not compatible with android wear. Might text is $80+ dollars per year and this is only $11 lifetime and works for both android and PC. Thanks!!!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John B,Okay. Today I'm done. The app and the web displays texts out of sync. The contact sync with google is wrong and a mess. This app WAS the king. Tonight... I'm gone. I imagine the developer will apologize and tell me to contact them. Don't fall for this... move on,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love it! Being able to text from my tablet (I know it uses my phone) is something Google should habe implemented when the first Android tablet came out. All of the features I care about and the developer responded to an feature request immediately and had it implemented in a couple months.,5

I just came from Google's Messages which I happened to like a lot but I decided to give another app a try because I had been experiencing technical difficulties with the app which had been going on for a while.

It's also just fun to be able to change the conversation colors. Really grateful I can use this instead of the Samsung app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've tried several messaging apps for my Android phone and this one works the best for multimedia messages. even having to pay a fee for Lifetime is worth it. The stock messaging apps on any of the Android phones I've used just don't cut it,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ray Herfurth,The platform occasionally is unstable. Message don't always go out from the desktop platform. Very unnerving as well as unacceptable. With no clear path to get support it cant always be counted on. It might be time to find a new platform.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Huong Lien Tran,"Used to be really good.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app told me it sent messages that were never sent. It didn't bother to ask for permission to send texts, or tell me my messages were not sending. It caused me hassle for a couple days before I uninstalled this useless, low information app. I would give it a 0 if I could.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pretty good app but have had problems with using the camera within the app not sending the pictures. Also would like to be able to make the outline of message bubble different colors vs the whole thing.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,A great sms app and very smooth indeed. If the app provides features of automatically grouping MESSAGES FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES and automatically BLOCKING ADVERTISING MESSAGES it would be the best sms app in the world. An option to add more people in group conversation is also needed.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,StillStanding,"What happened?.... Can't assign custom sms tones. Following the instructions, but it always reverts back. Also can't block somebody from the texting screen. Frustrating . I went to Textra and I'm very happy now.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,TrailDog,"So far so good..been using this about a year on and off. I like to try different apps as they come around, but this has remained the most solid.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Everything was going well until it started having trouble sending and receiving photo messages (or photo+text messages) and group messages - especially to iPhone users. Other members in the groups (both Android & ios) aren't having the same issues.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Had to jump ship from Android Messages after it killed my widget -- haven't looked back since. Simple and elegant yet fully capable. I expect the multi-platform functionality will be especially useful since Google killed SMS in Hangouts,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Initially, this app didn't sync the accounts, and I had to reset it multiple times to get it working. Once I did however, it became exactly what I was looking for. Tqo recommendation for the devs: let me like individual texts, & let me react to messages with emojis (like FB Messenger or Discord).",5

I uninstalled, re-bought the subscription (even though I bought a lifetime) and reached out to the help person to no avail. I have since deleted it and am asking for a refund.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great look to it. Easy to read but when texting it doesnt anticipate the next word You have to start typing each word before it shows up. It also doesnt remember phrases.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rohin Rajan,Notification shows all messages rather than recent one. When ever I get a notification of a new message the preview shows all my messages rather than just the recent message making it harder to read the new message from preview.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stephen Fisher,Enjoy this app. But after changing phones and using SMS restore backup program the pulse program is pulling from a database which is not what the Android default SMS program displays. It was very disappointed.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Bug?: Text messaging works normal, but MMS messages send in a separate 'three' person conversation that lists my number twice, as two of the three conversation members.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app. The fact it automatically backs up messages and contacts is enough, by itself, to make it worth the cost. Desktop app works well. Developer issues frequent updates.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Blaine Hanson,The best messaging app for Android! Works reliably and it's so nice to be able to send/receive messages via the Pulse Windows app when I'm at work... Far better than the clunky Android Messages for web experience. Well worth the cost!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,River Bond,"The processes keep running when you ""shutdown"" the program so the notifications keep coming. Has trouble staying connected to the internet. All in all, a waste of my money. I just switched to MyPhone.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick Bruce,"This app is by far the best I've used no bugs and it's been so helpful since the recent android 11 update it's linked to my phone, watch, tablet and even use it on my laptop when I'm just to busy to get my phone or is charging. It's a must have compared to the standard SMS apps .",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,AJ Rockefeller,"If you delete a previewed message it permanently leaves the text notification (1). Cant get back, read or delete it. Not in archive either. I'm not emailing support, you guys do that. Its been a problem for 5 years. You have to use a different messenger to delete them but now I'm worried doing that trick cause the girl who did that recently, pulse sent out a tonne of old messages screwing up her business.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ian Charles,"This app's got lots of nice features. I particularly like the ability to schedule SMS messages ahead of time, since it saves me the trouble of having to remember to ping people at some later time.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Courtney Jackson,"Easy to use. Some features changed with phone upgrade, like the keyboard. I liked when emojis on top menu, vice an additional click to access. The colors change, too, for the participants.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,wa m,"App still worked great, but not a fan on silent change of ownership. The app was sold, and there was no indication of this. I did not agree to new ToS. 0 stars for poor communication and not thrilled by new ToS. 2 stars because the app didn't seem impaired. New dev claims there were notices. I did not recieve one.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The best texting app I have found! Work's great for backing up and moving from one phone to another. I ended up buying a life time subscription worth it for the peace of mind and ease of use. Messages can be sent from the desktop app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great message app, everything is very nice. Only thing I'm having trouble with is when I edit a contact, as in changing their name or adding a photo, it doesn't update in the pulse app. Can you help me out?",4

The Pulse Texting App for Android is by far the most feature rich ,real world problem solving and in my opinionBEST TEXTING APP ever made.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love that it is not a Google app and that I can use it from my PC without it being a separate conversation. I also like that I can copy and paste a whole string and save it if needed. I signed up for the year instead of lifetime so I can continue to support the app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sam M.,"It's fine, simple sms app. I was expecting backup, but there is only online backup. I would like to do locale update. So gonna get the 7 day premium online backup function, transfer sms from my old device to the new and after I'm done cancel it.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The best texting app I've used and it's great to be able to use it with a PC, laptop or tablet if you want. I paid a very small price for a lifetime of using it from laptop or tablet, where others charge a monthly fee.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Dale Nicholls,I love that I can use the app cross platform on my ios and android devices. I also use it o. Windows and MacOS. The only issue I see is there is sometimes a delay on the message refresh on my Mac. Other then that I love the app. I also like that you can apply a password for private messages.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Best Android messaging solution out there for those that still need SMS/MMS. I purchased the lifetime subscription without hesitation.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love it. Inexpensive for lots of features. Versatile app to be where you want it when you need it. Changes are made globally. Plus I really enjoy the fill and layout of this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christopher Withers,It is really enjoyable texting app. I wish it had a few more features. I also wish all of my text messages would transfer over to desktop from my phone. Unfortunately they don't. I'm hopeful this will be fixed in the future.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"okay text app like the color coded groups and chats. refuses to send MMS or photos. it says that they've been sent, but is never received by the recipient. prob switching back to textra since i never had that issue",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robert Lyons,"Works great now. Pulse SMS dev did some troubleshooting and found out what my problem was. Appreciate the time and effort and quick response. Had to contact Maple Media Support and again was favorably impressed with the quick, concise and correct response.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse is faster and more stable than my phone's native messaging app, and I love the ability to set color themes for conversations. I just wish I was able to search within my conversations for keywords.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chase Eaton,Good features and liked the layout. THEN I realized several people had texted me back that I never received... Switched apps and all or the sudden a bunch of messages came through! Very disappointing!,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Deyan Damyanov,"It's a great product. Easy to use, pretty and free. The functionality is really rich and the web version, although paid, saves lifes when multiple or faster messages are needed.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Looks very nice so far.  I would like to use it with my Gear s3 but it doesn't show photos on the watch. It only tells me that there is a photo, unlike Textra which actually shows the photo. Is there a setting that will make the photo actually appear on the watch?",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Leaveil Armstrong,Best messaging app for android PERIOD! The feature I love the most is being able to use the desktop app to send and receive messages as well. I've tried several other big and small name apps and none work as good as Pulse.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Blake Hatherley,"Been using this app for years. Works pretty well between multiple devices! Once in awhile I'll have a message stuck and not go through from the desktop app, but otherwise this app has been excellent. Highly recommend!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Won't send MMS. Two different phones running entirely different versions of android. Took weeks to find out there even was a problem because MMS do not have delivery notifications so the app was falsely showing everything was working fine.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,India Hunter,"Just stopped working out of nowhere. The most frustrating thing. Tried to uninstall and reinstall and I can see notifications come through on my bar but the app is saying ""importing messages"". It's been hours!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,ANDROERUS,"I really don't get it! It was ""so hard"" for you to make the dual sim icons MORE VISIBLE and more distinguisable, with numbers for each sim in part (SIM 1 with a color and SIM 2 with another color), for us to know from which exact sim we are going to send the message ... or ... this aspect didn't ""worth your time""???!! Also, the ""dual sim"" options in settings are ... missing!!! Why?! The ""unread"" mark should have its INDEPENDENT color!!! Too bad that you ignored all of this in such a manner!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I really like the delay sending feature; I use this feature when sending emails. Feature Request: I would like to just display the 1st name of my favorite contacts in the notification bar (or be able to do nicknames).,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,KR Smith,"Super happy with this app, have never come across an ad in it and you can schedule messages! Level of customization is excellent as well. Will continue to use this app across devices.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Pajeaud,"I DID THE UPDATE AND STILL NOT RECEIVING NOTIFICATIONS...🤬🤬...Was a Great App after the lasted update 😡, I'm no longer getting notifications.....",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is more of a suggestion than a review as my past reviews are archived here and I'm pleased with the app by & large. However, one little thing that drives me nuts is that I have to delete a thread like 5 times before it disappears from my phone. For example, I received a text from someone on Friday night. I deleted it shortly after receiving it. I had to delete it again later on that night, Saturday afternoon, and just a few minutes ago here on Sunday afternoon. Why can't it just delete?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Richard Olguin,"This is a good app. However, I seem to get text messages from odd numbers promoting ads. I don't think this should be happening with the paid version. I never received messages like using the stock phone texting app. 😕",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse Duran,"This Pulse SMS /MMS app is so sweet!! Love how you can customize it! Light to dark, black theme! It's Awesome!! Fast, get all my textes, easy to block annoying people! If it's a Spam text Pulse will send the text/MMS to the blacklist.. pretty awesome!! This is one of the best apps!! Best part is that it doesn't have any Ads!!!!!!!! Great Job Pulse!! One question do you think you guys can make a Pulse Keyboard?? It'll be pretty badass!! GOD Bless you all! GOD is good! Thank you for reading this..",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"is there a way it can block and delete msgs like they never existed? [Feb01]: I already blacklisted a number, but when this number sends msgs, PulseSMS will give me a notification each time, and then I get a list of all blacklisted messages. I dont need that. I want the app to not alert me when a blacklisted SMS arrives, and never keep them (auto delete in the background). Just as if they literally never arrived.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,was great app as you can set up scheduled messages and delay send them. only problem is that since last update I'm not receiving all the messages that are sent to me by people and am missing out on texts from my clients. I only found out about this problem from my boyfriend after he got worried sick as he couldn't get hold of me and didn't want to bother me with a phone call at work. also no emojis,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Sheats,"Nice and light, and love all the customization. EDIT: I really loved this app, but I've had to discontinue using it because I found that I was randomly not receiving a few messages here and there. I hate to stop using it, but when it comes to a messenger, not receiving messages is kind of a deal breaker.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I gave this application a 4-star for two reasons. One reason is that it does not have a smiley icon. That means I cannot use the Android smileys. Second is it does not allow my scroll wheel to work on my watch. This one makes it so I cannot use the functions of scrolling through the messages with ease. My finger has to be used on that causing it to block the messages.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Larry R,Like the ability to send and receive texts on the web with a similar interface as the phone. The private conversations are nice. No complaints really. Very reliable. Keep up the good work!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John E,"Hello 5 star app, just need help with something. While the phone is working during the day there are no issues but during the night the messages seem to be delayed when sending from a non primary device",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John DeFino,For days now the desktop version on Windows reports that the server certificate is invalid. The desktop use was the reason I bought this app. It has been essentially useless for days now. How can the developers not know this is happening? This is obviously not run on a managed server or with a company that is aware of current conditions.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jenny Schuster,I keep receiving a notification that there's a glitch in the system and I need to wait for the developer to correct? Is this something that is being worked on?,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Hannah,"SMS app that is easy and intuitive, check. SMS app that works on my phone, tablet, and desktop using the same account, CHECK! This is exactly what I have been looking for, for a very long time.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Threw up errors implying it sends sms to an unknown number on mtc Namibia when I send to friends. First xxx 0209 and then xxx 0208. Worrisome. It also complains about lack of credit. I Do not use send from any device. Please investigate. Reboot had no effect. UPDATE : Uninstall and Re install seems to have helped, I could not determine if these were mtc system numbers. To be fair Rating raised to 3 stars. Clean, customisable app. Good design. I just have some doubts which need addressing.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,lu zalez,Overall this app works well! I find time stamps do not occur reliably in conversations. A few messages over time have to be sent before time stamp occurs. Is there a setting for this?,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I installed this because Google Messages was not conducting group messages as a group, only individual SMS messages. Pulse, however, is working exactly as desired. It is a damn good app. UPDATE Feb 04 2022 - Still using this app and liking it very much.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,M.,"So, I have two devices (Android). Device A is at home, and the primary device. Device B has two SIM cards itself. When compoising a SMS on Device B, I can select ""Default"", ""SIM 1"" or ""SIM 2"". Despite selecting SIM 1, I am not able to actually send a local SMS? I assumed that besides the cloud stuff, I was still able to send local SMS, but it seems this is not the case. Only remote access to the primary device seems possible...",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Like all the features...have issues with sending/receiving photos. Received all came through as separate messages and sent... rarely ended up arriving at friends phone. Not sure the issue 🙄,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ash Horton,"£90! Far too expensive Downloaded this based on a review which said a lifetime some off payment was £12. Looked on the website and was very impressed at how much is supported including windows Linux and wear OS but disappointed I couldn't find clear pricing. Downloaded the app to find it costs £1.79 per month, £17.99 per year or £89.99 one time payment. Far too much just so I can reply to my messages from my desktop. Make the pricing more clear on your website!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Puts Google Messages, Allo, and Hangouts to shame. Works fast, has great customization and encryption. Best of all the desktop app syncs flawlessly vs. Google that constantly resets and doesn't send messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Charlotte Binder,"Update 2: Based upon his argumentative replies to reviewers, it's clear that developer doesn't care that people encounter due to his poorly designed app. #Denial When I tried to install it, it told me to go their website and enter a code. There's nowhere to enter the code on their web page. The app refuses to be uninstalled. I select ""Uninstall"" and after a few seconds of trying to uninstall it will begin trying to complete installation and give me another code to enter on their website.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Florence E.,"Great app. Works as expected although I do wish it had more features considering the price vs competitors. Eg, ability to show and clear notifications from your phone via your PC.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steven Hagar,Good app but not 5 stars yet. Close. I like the customization. 10/27/21. still using and I'm very happy. Customisations are extensive and I love the privacy feature that let you have private texts. Not all apps let you do that. I pay for the extended version and I've yet to regret it. No ads and a very speedy app. Good job guys.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lamar Small,Don't download this app. Used it for years and it just got corrupted. I Uninstalled and reinstalled and it sent a bunch of messages and pictures to old contacts I hadn't spoken to for years! Stay away!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,G VG,"By far my favorite SMS app. The ability to sort, rename, and pin conversations is great. The ability to schedule messages for later is unique and so helpful.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The app is really great! I hope that they could adapt this app to Samsung's Edge lighting notification. The screen's edge doesn't lights up whrn i'm receiving a notification on my Samsung S8. Thanks!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jack Poore,"Nevermind, now it's hitting me with a price and hasn't yet worked. Google Search said it was FREE. Why do these type apps always promise easy and Free and there is always a hangup. It keeps saying doesn't support iPhone when I'm trying to create and account. THIS IS an Android. However I got it to install somehow on the phone, I think. So I'm trying to get it on the Chromebook and it asks, Sign in first please. I don't know what password it allowed me on the phone. Moving on.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Keith Chiappone,"The interface and features are nice, but there were many texts that were sent from other people but didn't come through that later showed up in my stock messaging app when I switched back.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I stopped receiving messages from people. Some gets through, some don't. It also does not sync well with my tablet. It started to charge me for subscription without texting a reminder before they do.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The app overall is okay from a functionality standpoint. That said, lack of customization options, including synchronization with your phone's theme, limit its overall appeal.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"OP6T / OP Launcher To anyone on the fence about downloading this app after reading the 1,2 and 3 star reviews, pay attention to the dev's replies. Most, if not practically all, ""reasons"" people are giving low ratings is user error. Majority of the complaints from users can be answered from reading the app description or checking the ""Help"" link supplied. The app works as described. I use the free version as I have no need for multiple platform messaging and it works flawlessly",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"After I got my Samsung Gear S3 watch, Ii was forced to go looking for a new messaging app because my stock messaging app would not allow me to reply to texts from my watch. So I gave Pulse a try and the first thing I want to say is I love this app! The dev has hit upon a nice combination of features while still keeping things relativwely clean and simple, and it plays nice with my Samsung Gear S3 watch. And this dev responds to emails and answers questions, unlike so many devs I have attempted to contact. So why not 5 stars? Well, unfortunately this app does not receive MMS on my Xiaomi Mi6 phone (running MIUI 10 = Android 8.0. It is not a problem with my phone, because several other SMS/MMS apps that I have tried do receive MMS. This bug has been reported on the Pulse github but no resolution so far. I would give this app 10 stars if MMS worked on my phone! If you have a Xiaomi phone, look elsewhere. BTW I paid for a lifetime license anyway, because I am happy to support this dev's good work and efforts to fix this MMS issue so that I can start using Pulse as my messaging app!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nic H,I like it but it only lets me blacklist everyone in a group message instead of the entire conversation like Textra does. I don't know how to get around it. I just want to to removed from group messages. Ok so now I'm not receiving messages from others and it does not store my old messages. I'm going to have to switch to another app.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark Russell,"So Many Improvements That It Now Sucks. Leave the damned app alone. You're ruining it. Why must you make ""improvements"" that don't help anyone? They're nothing more than ill considered changes, not at all improvements. When zi send an email to myself, I want to see it under my name, not under ""Notes to Self"", and I do not want to see anything in that thread that wasn't sent to me. I do not want to see notifications or voice message transcripts in that thread. That is not the place for them.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cristian Ayala,"Was a five star before, but now since I'm no longer able to use it in browser (90% of my usage for the app) it's lost all functionality for me now.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse has been the first app to pull me away from Textra, which I used for 3 years. Pulse is clean and way to navigate, notifications are not annoying and can be adjusted per conversation. I am quite happy with the ui and the app as a whole.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Richard Hostmark,"Have been using this app for about a week. Very happy with it. Now that I can send sms from my tablet and laptop i don't really need to keep my phone with me when I'm at home, which is almost always during ro-ro. All I need my phone for now is calls, which are rare - I don't like to talk on the phone. I paid for the lifetime membership; more than happy to get some cash the developer's way since this has been so useful for me.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Usman Zafrullah,"Great app, has inbuilt backup, organisation features, cross platform, and does them all well. Only drawback being the inability to export and import messages supposedly due to it being end to end encrypted. Highly recommended if you can commit to this app for SMS.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love this app! By far the best texting app by itself, and the browser feature makes it unbeatable. I switched from Textra, bought a lifetime license, and I'm never going back.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really like it. I love how it's customizable and works so smoothly. Probably the best messaging app I've ever used. I'm very happy to pay a yearly subscription service to be able to access this on multiple platforms. My compliments to the developer(s),5
xyz.klinker.messenger,George Ramsay,Works very well and private box is easy to use. It would appear that you need to upgrade to be able to save and archive old messages and accidental deletes.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very well develop app, works great on the web and has a lot of control over chat colors, notification icon color based on chat, chat sounds and remote backup so when you get a new phone everything syncs. Love it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim Arnett,Working much better than in the beginning. Syncs like it should. Changing phone numbers isn't a smooth transition. Don't really want to delete my account and messages. Should be an easier solution.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have been looking for an app like this for ages. Now on my phone, my PC and my Android tablet. Works as advertised and I havent used it long enough to find any issues. well worth the lifetime purchase. By the way, a clearer instruction on installation would have save me some heartburn. It didnt work at first until I worked out it has to be installed on the mobile with the SIM card and phone number. set up the account, remember user name and password, then just load it on go PC etc. and log in",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I think the developer has a winner do far I still would to see having the ability to save the data in a second or third location in case of malfunction or other issues. I would pay for that,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A E,"Works well, reliable, good interface... Great replacement for Google messages. Remote texting works seamlessly! I can leave my phone by the cell booster and text via wifi on the farm with no service - bought lifetime subscription.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is exactly what i was looking for in an messaging app. It has true dark mode, we can customise it's swipe actions as well as quick actions. Kudos to its developer. I hope he keeps the true dark mode forever and not switch to dark grey colour.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jerry Garren,"Love the utility and flexibility of this app. With the recent increase in spam texts, the dev team should consider improving the blacklist by creating a feature to allow users to easily blacklist a block all texts beginning with a certain sequence of numbers (e.g., 3130204***).",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Brandie “B”,This is a great messaging app for Android users who like to stay fairly organized and it's pretty user friendly. I've yet to connect to the laptop and navigate it in that way yet though,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like this app a lot! It's very fast, easy to send, nice variety of colors on the contact bubbles, what it lacks is: more configurations for background in the list and individuals.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like the ability to use one number to text from multiple phones for my business. 30 percent of the time the messages don't send or come in... That can be frustrating when most of my communication its time sensitive.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Siggi Asztalos,Attachments from browser plug in are problematic. I wish you could black list entire area codes or reg expressions of numbers. Otherwise I've been using this app seamlessly for years. Works awesome.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse has been very handy to have on my phone & PC. When I have forgotten my phone I can still get texts on my pc. One thing I would like to see is an option when deleting texts to be able to highlight all texts with a person & then undelete the ones I want to keep. Right now I can either delete the texts one by one or delete all of the texts.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeremy Logeot,"Love it. Main reason I use it is for the scheduling. And it works wonderfully well. Also, one time I had a trouble with my text messaging (which ended up not being due to Pulse) and the developer kindly replied to all my concerns and questions.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I might love the app, if my messages actually showed up on my tablet.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It's awesome experience. Only that when you open a message for the first time it's shut down and you have to reopen it.. Also my phone is duo simcard. It's doesn't opt me to choose which SIM card to use while sending text. It's just send direct using SIM 1. The rest of it is awesome,4

But from the watch there were many steps to start up- tells me to go to a computer- to the website- create an account but, no link to create an account; I assume I'll have to reinstall the app on ur phone- then it requires a paid membership account to use. Don't assume. When did I ever say u should work for free. Maybe put out a free version with ads that are not invasive, like many other free apps.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,the idea of what this app could be is great but since using this app both me and people I send messages to have been receiving pictures sent in either direction twice. I made an attempt to contact the developer for assistance and received no reply. I even have the paid version of the app. Really regretting the purchase now.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shanna Anderson,"Great app but I would have to buy two copies, on for my work phone and one for my personal phone if I want to send via each phone number. Keeping for personal. That would be a nice feature for future revisions.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Royce Okazaki,Love the accessibility of the app. There are still some features that could be better.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian York,I was a big fan of Textra for many years. And this app seems very similar to it so I have high expectations. But I cannot use a custom notification sound on this app. It would be really great if that were possible,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lance Murray,"Only text app that works well on my old S5. I would like to use the carriage/line return when typing but it doesn't seem to exist. Or maybe I'm stupid. I'm buying it if you take Google reward dollars...okay, You do and I just bought it. Danke Schoen. I still need the CARRIAGE/LINE RETURN FEATURE. It only allows me to select those emojis that I will never use. Things like :) or (: or ×) I don't want that. I want a line return key.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Everything about the app is great... except it rarely receives texts in a timely manner. It sometimes takes a week for a text to come in after someone else sends it.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Herrera,Sometimes a bit glitchy. A shut down and power up of the phone usually fixes that. I don't really care to do this twice a week. A suggestion to the developers is to get familiar with all android platforms.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,ListenHereMeow,"8-23-21 Still no really after 5 emails 8-21-21 Still no reply 8-17-21 Contacted support. No answer. 8-17-21 Crashing can't use app. WORST MESSAGE APP EVER!!! Update 9-6-20 Had to restore to a new phone lost all the images because it didnt back them up. False advertising. Bad program! Update 8-4 dev was so rude!!!!! 5-14 Contacted the developer 14 times, no response. He's clearly upset that I left a bad review. 4-11 the app just deleted a bunch of my messages.Can't block spam text messages",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This message system is the greatest yet. You can text from the phone and tablet. There is even a computer app and a webpage extension. The only thing is that it does not like stickers or emojis very well.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Scott Johnstone,The best spam filtering I've seen (by keywords) after trying the top 7 texting apps although there's no way to review what's been marked as spam. It could also learn a thing from textra in texting favorites.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Better than MightyText! Perfect for my phone, tablet, and pc. Seamless integration, super fast sending/receiving of text AND pictures. Clean and efficient. Works every time. A+++",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Miss Tiffany Green,The pulse app is pretty neat....actually blocking people.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app! Not only do the PC apps work great for texting, but using this app I can text from both my work phone and personal phone number from a single device! Simple instructions on how to do this are on the Pulse website, easy to follow!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent app. Does exactly what it needs to, good customization, well optimized for lower-powered devices, the shortcuts I find are both incredibly useful and unintrusive. Great job, devs!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,switched to this when the Google messages was not working great. used for long time now there is issue with the being able to take a picture from the app used to work fine. now it won't open just black camera views,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"mySMS is better in many ways than this. See below in detail. All of the following where I say Pulse fails or can’t do, mysms can do it correctly.   • Speed: the SLOWNESS of fetching the messages in the browser is painful – especially compared to mySMS.  • Furthermore, when I click away to another tab to check sthing, then I would want to continue creating the SMS, the extension has to start over to load the content with its painfully slow (compared to mySMS) speed and the ALREADY TYPED IN CONTENT IS LOST!  • International characters: When I create a message on the phone, the character count doesn’t consider if I’ve set to strip Unicode chars.  • Pulse fails to find messages in the browser if the search term contains international (i.e. accented) letters.  • Pulse in the browser doesn’t display Contact pictures.  • There is no character count in the web interface.  • Pulse doesn’t open in a new tab maximized, hence it is awkward to use.   • My conclusion: there is potential in Pulse – it lags behind mySMS very much.  mySMS is sleek and just plain works. What it does, it does perfectly. Pulse (theoretically) offers more features, but even what it offers, can’t do seamlessly.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ma Ja,"If the send button wasn't right next to the text, this app would get 5 stars. Doesn't make any sense to have an accidental send happen when that button doesn't need to be right in the text field.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Turner,"Works quite well. Had daily problems with the Windows ""Your Phone"" link app. Finally gave up and went back to Pulse and all is well. Support is very responsive as well.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Very nicely done and easy to use sms app i can use across my phone and desktop. It doesnt have some of the bells and whistles of some other apps but is solid and updated regularly.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I used to love this app but now group messages are all coloring themselves purple and yellow for each person and despite changing this in the settings it won't apply. This makes it very difficult to distinguish between people.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love the app, but recently am getting so many failed to send messages. So frustrating. Excellent reception. Huawei mate 30 pro, Vodafone au. Tried refreshing, and deleting account. Very frustrating indeed!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Vicki Upchurch,I love it when it first came out because it would let have different tones for each contact it still does but the repeat it goes back to default. It used to repeat the same Tone that you set up. What happen to that? ? ?,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Emily Snyder,This app has been great for years but now it constantly crashes and no longer will give notifications of new messages. Unfortunately I have to uninstall it and search for a new messaging app.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Dahl,Not perfect but the best messaging app that I have found thus far. Would have gotten five stars but it sometimes loses your existing messages when you switch and then sign up for the premium version.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Been using this app across multiple phones for the past few years, it works great for me. Although, I don't get super into texting, I chose this app because it let's me customize the colors of the app and whatnot.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,everything i need in a messaging app. this app has lots of customization and offers web access so i can message from other devices as well. im doing the week trial but most likely will buy it after thr trial ends. will update review when that happens.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mina Smith,I've been using this app for a little while now and I love it for its simple features and easy to use layout. The one downside I've noticed is you can't just have a general message tone for non specific people.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark Silva,"Like most of us, we rely heavily on our texting to family, friends and businesses. Pulse provides a program similar to Outlook. I absolutely love the phone and computer apps...",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,B B,"Good app. No ads thankfully and works ok. Update Didnt get texts from my dad (i saw his phone) today, almost missed getting to spend time with him. The whole reason i switched to pulse was because the original text app was messed up. Maybe its my phone.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike St James,"Maple has fixed the certificate problem that denied Windows access for a few days. It was very aggravating for a heavy text user like me, but it's fixed as of today, 2021.12.13. I still believe this is the best multi-plarform SMS tool.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Melinda Jennings,This is a great app. The Google messaging app would drop apps. This one has not added it all and is a great option if you have any expired or not available messages.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"With the new update, when you select black on the tool bar it blacks out the entire notification bar where it says your phone provider / time and service. Every other color you select its fine.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Unreliable. Sending messages doesn't work a lot of the time. It looks as if it worked in the app but the message was not sent. Use Google's Messages for Web instead, at least it works.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike R,So far this is amazing. I used android messages for a long time but got turned off by Google's politics and dishonesty with privacy so this seemed to be a good alternative. Not only is it a good alternative but I would say it beats android messages in every aspect so far!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Easy to use, easy to customize. the user experience is great! Its so great that I got a lifetime membership and that allows ro respond to texts from my computers! Thanks!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian Shappee,"Wife not pleased! I loaded the paid-for version on my phone and couldn't receive a simple graphic message from my wife. So I, unfortunately, was forced to return to the stock version to ensure that I didn't land it hot water with her. I loved the abilities to pin messages and to schedule future messages.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Installed only to find this is another app pretending to be but is in reality a 7 day trial. After 7 days you must pay to use. Due to this dishonest ploy, I refused to use the application and immediately removed the program without sending single text or draft. The only good thing is they show their dishonesty immediately allowing for rapid removal.|| This is where I took exception: Pulse SMS is completely free to use on your phone. Seems an oxymoron if you have to pay for a free app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jellybirds Adventures,Revised for google hangouts. I thought this app didn't work. But I just discovered that I must first signout of google hangouts on both phones. Unsync it so to speak. Then the app works great and real time to receive my text from my google phone to the Verizon phone.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chuck Braun,"10/09/21 Notifications don't come through?! I have it on but I have to physically check for messages. My at&t payment msg. came, but I got no notification. Thats why calls and net wouldn't work! Just updated. Hope that is fixed. We'll see. CB3 10/08/21 getting messages now. Updated again. Hopefully more control. CB3 all fixed. can't beat it! A hui ho! CB3",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tony Hoffman,"I was asked by developers to change my review so as to not deceive other users. So I moved it from 2 stars to one. I can no longer receive texts from RCS android users. ATT not myself can figure out how to restore my texts to work. Pulses app is the direct cause of this. They say their app is free but the screen once you install is deceiving and designed to make people believe you need to pay, the free feature is hidden in plain site. Stay away from this app. Now they think I'm stupid 😂",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Juan Soto,It just worked perfectly. Everything works as advertised. Have had multiple problems with a bunch of other messaging apps. None whatsoever with Pulse!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bob Hetrick,"A solid texting app that I can use from my phone, my tablet, and laptop. This greatly increases the usefulness of texting. Update 8/22/2021:. Why I like everything feature wise, I am having the problem that some of the messages that my son sends me from his Iphone never get to me. After we discover this he sends me an image showing that he sent me one or more messages that I never saw -- whether on Pulse on my Android phone, windows laptop or Galaxy tablet. What can be done about this?",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Excellent and Amazing Application I definitely love it. This is exactly what I having seeking for. This messenger has a lot customization features including dark and black themes. This is plus that fund in other massagers applications. It is all about customizing to one's choice.,5

I'm getting txt'd from a Gmail addresses that is sending to a block of numbers, making it a group conversation, and the only way to block it seems to be to block all recipients.. instead of just the sender. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the App.. still getting to know it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Misleading, not as free as they claim. This app boasts that it is totally free, but the only free feature is to text from your phone, any SMS app can do that, but in order to sync to other devices you need to pay. Lies lies lies, very frustrating.",1

So now Google Play store & credit card company are doing seperate investigations on the developer. I followed all steps to contact the developer myself for a refund & zero response. I sent it over a year ago. The credit card company gave me a refund as no one responded. I got my money back from the credit card company.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Was fine until a few days ago. Have been using this for a while, but the past few days I have stopped receiving messages in group chats. I switched over to messages and received them, so it's definitely the app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great idea, works intermittently. Doesn't seem to handle group messages with graphics -- image only, no text. Desktop connection also finicky. But dedicated dev with excellent track record",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"ok klinker, sometimes whenever i open it, optimizing your message pop up appears that takes way too long, plus can you seperate the ringtone from the phone ringtone notif sounds, because it sounds the same and i dont want that, i want the pulse has its own seperate custom ringtone that i can get from my phones music, can you fix this please its really annoying",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I needed and searched for days looking for the perfect text message app for my tablet that is strictly wifi. Pulse exceeded that need so I can get my text messages from either my tablet or phone. And only $10.99 for a lifetime being able to text on my tablet or any other device that I need linked to my phone, how can you beat that?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,MIKE HAWK 818,All of a sudden tonight..I don't get my messages. It said text message working in background but it never comes through. I switched to default app and the messages get received... Guess you have to pay for it now.. Little heads up would be nice,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Started out well a year ago but downhill from there. The recent updates have pretty well made it useless. Intermittent notifications and an inability to actually send texts are forcing me to look elsewhere. This seems to be the norm when paying for apps these days. Eventually the app gets abandoned or the developer gets in over their heads.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Chubrick,Works pretty well. Room for some minor improvements. Make sure your phone has a good connection (cell or WiFi) though when sending messages from other devices.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Incze Joseph,I used this app for about 7 years. No issues whatsoever. Recentely I changed my phone and when I instaled the app sudenly I had to pay user fee? I just deleted and instaled a different one but is not as good as Pulse. I would like to get back but no paying version.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tim Watson,"Best texting app I have found. Group chat not working, messages not received so I simply don't use it for that. Private messages effectively hidden. Overall, despite lack of group messages, excellent.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,kwame appiahene-agyei,Great app. Schedling messages need improvements. You cant see the entire message while you type it you have to scroll through to do that..also too easy to accidentally exit out of scheduling,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,For 11 bucks for a lifetime subscription you can't afford not to use this app if you need be able to get your messages on all your divices. I love this app. Pay once instead of every month in perpetuity. Thanks!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"You'll find it does not really back up for restore as it clearly says it does in the help section where someone asked that specific question. I accidentally deleted messages by mistake, and this app then could not restore them. The developer refused to admit that it does not do as stated, even though I quoted the exact sections from his pages and then kept my full payment and refused a refund or to address the email. I got them back as I had used another app to back up from the original text app",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Ferguson,Used Textra and Android Messages or whatever they call it now for years. I prefer this over both of them. Pulse gives me all the features I want and need in a clean customizable experience. Thank you!,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,David Blommendahl,One of the reasons I enjoy Android as an operating system is the ability to customize your SMS app. This app is what I would have dreamed up of if I could create one on my own. All the customization you could possibly want in a very efficient package.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Use the paid app for volunteering charity activities when out and about 24/7. Recently it has been avoiding ringing and showing notifications causing problems. Unreliability means a move away to a basic message app hence losing sync across phones and tablet.,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Well I just transferred here from Textra and it was some getting use to. I wish you could customize the vibration on this device to have it ring differently from other messages you get. Besides that I think it's a lovely messaging app that has everything. Give me that vibration customization and you have yourself 5 stars!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kyle Keane,"So far so good, very clean UI and highly functional. Pretty good for low vision (not everything respects dark theme yet) and works perfectly with TalkBack for users with print disabilities on Android.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It's solid and has nice customization features and a lengthy but comprehensive support page that addresses any issues I might have. A must have app for anyone who likes to text.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lina žinutė,"Notification sounds on MIUI don't work! 😢 [Has cost me extra money because of the default MMS configuration...

Cons: doesn't have an emoji set.]",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Wade Jones,Love being able to text across devices. But I wish it handled contact groups a little more like the native app. It lists groups but when chosen it isn't the group that I had set up.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This text app is AWESOME! Has so many nice features and works extremely well. I switched over all my phones to this app and maybe even my computer will have texting. Nice job and looking forward to more surprises in the future.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,COLIN TREVOR,After the swift reply on the best way in saving text's you can refer back to if needed I now upgrade my rating to 5* I really like the colours you can create for any contacts you keep on file. However it's the best message app I've used - I would easily recommend,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Edwin Martinez de Andino,"Excellent, no problems with its use. Only complain is the yearly fee for the upgrade. A one time fee should be enough. The upgrade is not a musr",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Was everything I was wanting and needing from text app I hated to uninstall it but too many missing messages and I'm not doing uninstall and reinstalling over and over in hopes it works. Fix the missing messages issue and you have a golden product on your hands.,2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Shawn McNamara,I found this by accident while looking for apps that repeat notifications until the message is marked «read». Now I'm learning that it's a very nice messaging app for other things too. :),5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great. I use it only for normal SMS texts and downloaded it so I can schedule texts on a pixel phone. I was lost without this feature. Pulse does seem to use up my battery more hence 4 stars.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,John Opie,Pulse is an excellent SMS program. The one drawback I've noted is that it is complicated if you want to print back messages via your computer and printer. This is a new request I have installed pulse SMS on my laptop but it's demanding a PW none of my tries work any help? I can't get it to login a new PW on the computer. It never demands a pw on this phone. Which had worked get for years. John Opie,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,William White,"App is great, the pro version is awesome. My only complaint is that if a vendor like Amazon sends a confirmation text I answer on Pulse they do not get my answer. I immediately switch back to SMS app the Samsung supplies and answer the confirmation and they get it. Then I switch back to Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nancy Ulrich,I'm happy with your Pulse app. I've got a lifetime subscription. But if you included a way to block or allow me to automatically delete by keyword I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE it!

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like how I can use this app on my computer and chromebook. So much easier to write texts on a real keyboard rather than the phone. I use it all the time and it's replaced my regular standard messenger app on my android devices and windows computers.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I liked the app when it was working. I bought the lifetime subscription but all the sudden the app states that I change my subscription (and pay again)... But even before loss of subscription, the web app stopped working.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nathanael Williams,"Best SMS app I've found! Far better than the default one. I love how customise this app is, there are so many options to choose from. And it's so useful to be able to log into it from my iPad and PC on the internet as well.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nikodaemus (Niko),"It's very nice in a lot of ways. However, it doesn't always detect when SMS come in, and doesn't always update the system notification when they do. Fix this and it's 5☆",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark Morton,"I love this app as I can send texts from my PC desktop, Android car stereo or phone and my content is always there. Makes using multiple devices invisible from a ""will it work?"" perspective and phone upgrades even easier.",5

I can receive that fine but when I attempt to reply I get this error: ""Error Invalid Number. Please re-send using a valid 10 digit number"". When I try to add the area code, it strips it and get the ""invalid number"" error again.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gk Exp,Works perfect and has really nice aesthetics. Allows you to choose the colors you want as opposed to a white screen that eats up batteries. 10/18/20: Still the best!!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've used about all SMS apps and this takes the cake. You'll always know when a text comes with its repetitive notification. Simple, clean, functional.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kaz,Good app. Could be improved in customization options. A shortcut to enable driving mode would be very useful. Right now it seems to be buried.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Marvin A. Arâuz Madriz,"Very accurate as in its name says Phone/Tablet/Web. Yes, indeed it does the job. I like its very sleek UI and I'ld definetely recommend it. My kudos to the developer(s) for such an excellent tele-communication App.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"too difficult to use. I would just throw the whole thing in the shitcan. first of all you have to register to use it and then when you push on the send button, it will not send a message. you have to actually schedule it to be sent even if it's just one minute later. how's that for feedback screwball.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Kenny Martin,This app is great... BUT why doesn't the message list automatically scroll to the top when I exit a message window? Edit: This issue still isn't fixed. It's been 6 months.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,J. Araya,"This app is working great for us. With a simple text or picture We notify our customer (1000) about service schedule changes and working hours for holidays. We find it easy to spread the news. Instead of sending letters, emails or making phone calls. Save time and money.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Damien Moody,Pulse was completely broken after a recent update. It crashed repeatedly and failed to deliver notifications. Had to uninstall after 2 years as a happy user.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cliff Berg,It's really a good messaging app. It is complete in design and setting is thorough for ones preference. I honestly believe it's likely the best messaging app. available. Definitely 5 stars.,5

Uninstalling. *UPDATE AFTER RESPONSE* The point is that telling it once you don't want to create an account should be enough. Thats what all the reviews are saying but you don't listen. Hence 1 star.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Julie Harradine,"After 3 weeks learning and figuring out my first Galaxy watch I am finally getting texts on the watch that I can read and reply to in real time thanks to Pulse!. I tried lots of fixes, reinstalled everything (twice), different SMS apps, saw where Pulse said 'on any device' and downloaded it and it works!! I am so happy now that the watch is actually doing its thing how it is supposed to and I receive texts from work while I am working in the community and I can reply! 100 stars Pulse!!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Linda Bennett,Great app..works way better than AT&T. Improvements could be to have an option to enlarge the text . If I send someone a link it always stays in the most recent sent text .,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nate,"For a paid app it's not that good. Glitchy, deleted messages will suddenly reappear. Messages sometimes don't arrive, as if there's a hidden spam filter. Could be much better",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Julie Laub,"I like it, although my biggest issue is that the notifications go away as soon as they pop up. I am not able to see if I have gotten a text if I am not looking or my phone is off. I have had this issue before with other apps, and I don't know why it won't stay.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,like the look and feel but messages disappear and reappear. group texts are weird... i use it for work so I can not have something that may not work.,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Just the perfect replacement app I wanted from ugly Google Message. Black theme and other neat features are very handy. Just a suggestion, instead of pulse written on notification bar be replaced by new message? Overall I thank you for developing the app I wanted. Appreciate your hardwork.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Arya Azartash,Lifetime subscriber. Good looking interface with lots of useful customization options. The web interface looks and works great.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Richard Rudnicki,"The real deal for cross platform, internet connected devices for SMS/MMS messaging on Android. The messaging Pulse app is very nice, I was using Textra which is one of the best, Pulse has more useful features, if not as esthetically pleasing.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like most everything about this app. I would love if the templates could be in a certain order. I send a series texts daily to new clients and must search for the one I want.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kevin Forster,Works much better that the Samsung message app. The main reason I like this is because I can set a separate tone for a particular sender. I know who in my close friends and family sent me a message!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Not happy with this app. I use it because of its cross platform capability; unfortunately, it wont update on my desktop. The messages I see there are days, if not weeks old. Nothing current shows up, even uninstalling / reinstalling doesn't fix the problem.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Wesley Anzai,Our review on the pulse SMS app. We like the pulse SMS app there's a lot of versatility with this app you can use it on different platforms PC Android Apple etc. We paid for the lifetime membership. So there's no ads on this app. You will enjoy this app as much as we do. * Update We had a problem sending photos over to iPhones and FaceTime. No solution to that yet but other than that this is a cool app. Hugs Wes n Wanda. - Hawaii,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Gomes,"Beautiful design. Private. Safe. Cross platform (if you want) or standalone. I use it standalone as an sms app and its fantastic. I also use Talon, Luke's twitter app because its the best app for twitter. This developer is one of the few good ones you can trust not to steal or share your data. And that is priceless in todays crazy world",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Peter Segal,"Best text app and I've tried many. Even has a Windows version so you can text from your laptop. Synchs with your phone. As someone born in Boston, would say, Pulse SMS is ""Wicked Awesome.""",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"i really like this app but i'm having issues with delays. Luke tried to help but says the delays are out of Pulse's control yet when i use Android Messenger i do not have the delays which can be hours. While testing i sent a message from pulse then sent another from messenger and the one from messenger arrives in both pulse and messenger long before then one sent from Pulse.  I have pulse running on my one plus phone, desktop, and laptop. Anyone else experience anything similar?  I would easily give this app 5 stars if we can get the delay issue sorted out...",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,1-Way Direct LLC,Love it for the use of handling business on other devices other than my personal. Im only giving 3 stars because the interface could be better. I should be able to log into pulse from another android phone which am not able but it says ANY DEVICE.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aaron Cantrall,"Love it so far! Switched from android messages for a few reasons: - this app lets you customize conversation colors like android messages used to but then took that feature out - the bubbles in android 11 work with this app, I couldn't get them to work in android messages - pinning chats to the top of your list is actually pretty useful!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,SMS is still the most used messaging system in the world. Pulse takes it to the highest level with its features and the developers pride in the app. It has everything I need.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Davey Sunderland,"Excellent app, I switched over after using Textra for years and I absolutely love it. The desktop option is amazing and really puts it over the top with competing apps.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This application kicks ass. Never have I had as much success using this application as any other text messaging apps for SMS and or MMS and by far is superior. Oh yeah I absolutely love the fact if I'm sitting on the toilet and someone text my phone it comes through to my tablet so I can reply back absolutely a must have for all Android users. Also nice if you have an iPhone then again it's an iPhone so you should smash it but before you do download the app LOL,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I loved this app and even paid for it, but kept missing messages.. i had to switch because i would miss MMS.. i don't know what was up with that, I'm willing to give it a shot again, if that can be sorted out.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,barbara carranza,"New to this smart phone stuff but my brother told me to try it and thought it was better than messenger that came with the phone. Only wish I could reply ""just to sender"" instead of all, I don't see that option when I am ready to type a response. Other than that great app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Quick, easy to use, no frills messaging app. I had been experiencing a TON of lag with my stock messaging app. With Pulse I send and receive messages very quickly. Would recommend to anyone!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Switched from iOS after using it since 2008 and really miss the iMessage feature of back up and sync of messages and using it on computers.. this app is pretty close to perfect.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love pulse. Great app and chrome plug in. Makes texting enjoyable and easy to manage. I love being able to mute groups, pin groups and label them. Interface is clean and simple.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I used to think Textra was the best SMS app, but boy I was wrong. This is a much cleaner design with a very intuitive interface. Plus it has no ads like Textra does.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Becky Lopez,"Worked seamlessly since I joined and then on 12/9, poof! Not working on my Chromebook. Webpage down and connection not private. Will change to 5 when resolved. Sent message to support. Waiting. New! Within a biz day or so, I received an email stating it was resolved -- impressed with Customer Support. Thank you as a paying subscriber.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great options for putting your own style to the overall look easy to use great app appreciate the job well done One complaint if you delete a message of a special contact notification you have to reassign the special notification overall all I'm well pleased with the app super excited to see it continue to grow,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse is the best cross platform SMS app by a lot. The standalone apps for PC, Android and even my galaxy watch look great and sync without any problems. Worth every penny.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jessie Simon,"Good app for messages, it's fast and doesn't crash... The only thing I want you in this app is sending empty messages, one of my service provider only allow me to send an empty message to send my balance... but for real the app is amazing.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Derek Vandenheuvel,"Love it, just wish there was a little more customization. Maybe something to categorize groups of friends to separate from all the verification codes.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Best texting app available, hands down. It just works, and works well. I was happy to buy a lifetime membership, something I'd rarely do, because of the quality and frequent updates. Keep up the good work!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,aje3721,"Very nice transition from old app. Wish it gave you one additional device without charging you. Still trying to figure out sounds when sending though. Still, great app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Wow - really nice set of features, and was really impressed with the consistency of the interface across devices: phone, tablet, Windows, Linux. very nice job!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Hendricks,"Not nearly as good as most free apps. The app is free to download, but I had to pay a monthly subscription fee before it works. The developers response here is specious at best. A lie of omission is still a lie in the LORD's eyes. When I say free, I actually mean free. It's free unless used as advertised. Learn to spell. I didn't call you a liar (correct spelling). I said you lied. Not quite the same. I'm not changing your rating. Quit harassing me about it.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gene,"I just started using pulse this week. So far it does everything I need it to. My only complaint is that on the keyboard, I have to choose between having an Enter key or an emoji button. I can't have both.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Flerger Bergitydersh,"Just going to keep using this one because why not. It works, its good, its open source. Useful widgets, and even extra features for a small fee, including online sms backup. And you know that the app is trustworthy because you can see its source code. Why would I use anything else?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I bought the lifetime membership because initially I loved the layout and the format and usability. Shortly after I realized I wasn't receiving 1 in 6 messages especially MMS messages. I missed an entire group chat to plan a Friday out. The bells and whistles aren't worth it if I can't rely on it to deliver all messages..... unfortunate :(,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aradhana Mitra,"I don't want to say but must say this app may have many feature but lack many features also,first message search system very poor,lacking also feature like star message which is useful to mark only vital conversation which we used to in whatsapp and it also not has recycle bin for messages.Now it's upto developer if he take my suggestion n improve or get angry n just stay happy with what he did!!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love that it pulled my old text into my new phone with no issues and that I have access on my PC as well. More custom options would be nice like BG Image but overall functionality is Top.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Neockwon,"Love this app. But I have a huge issues with people sending images. They notify me they sent them, but I never recieved them, even though if I look on the phone of the person who messaged me, it shows they sent it. I'm curious for a way to fix this",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,V Divine,"PROS: The option to change theme colors, emojis styles to use with your phone's system, Facebook, IOS & Twitter. And u can use Duo video chat. CONS: a monthly fee to use on other devices including the web (Google's web version is free), and I counted only 2 Smart Reply responses vs Google's option to auto reply via emojis, stickers & Gifs.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tijani Usman,"The best I've come across. Perfect for me in every way except one. The font zooming not big enough for my elderly eyes. Why not something like ""22 pt to 45 pt'. The 'small to extra large' not big enough for me. Hope to see that in your future update. Thanks a million.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"OMG thank you i literally never write reviews and i HAD to write one you your app. i needed an app that could do Scheduled SMS and was super bummed id have to completely switch to your app as a default bc I'm so used to Google messages app. BUT YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A GOOD APP! i just wish all the features were for free that Google does, such as cross platform access. i get that you have to make money, but still...",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love the ease of use and reliability. The ability to store messages in private folder. The automatic back up feature. Solid app. I recommend it to all users. Thanks,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I downloaded this app, very excited that it has features I am looking for. However, as usual I read the reviews and the developer's response. God forbid, I ever have a problem with this app. If you take the time to look at the critical reviews, the developer's response is absolutely unprofessional, rude, and way out of line-even if the consumer is wrong. The app is great, but as a customer, when I have a problem-I don't want to be shamed. I want help. So, I will just have to keep looking.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Good overall messaging app, but doesn't seem to easily allow editing or removing a contact from a group, making it necessary to pick individually from a group and taking more time.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,hamdan sahil,Nice sms app with no ads,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Emilie St. Landau,"Easy to use. I like that you can color-code conversations, and schedule messages to be sent later. It even lets you know when it sends! I am incredibly happy with Pulse SMS.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stephen Werth,I wanted to like this app but I continued to have issues sending and receiving picture messages. I have Verizon and use the Messenger+ app currently. Great app if it worked for me. I canceled during the trial period.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Einre Aznarrac,Simple to use. Easy to customize. Convenient. Great for backup and restore of texts/mms or transferring to a new phone. I'm quite pleased with it!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe Hayes,"Firstly, holy cow I'm impressed. This app was thoughtfully created. So far there are 3 immediate points that make it stand out. Private conversations, auto responder, and connectivity to my Galaxy Watch 3... Update, developers have helped will with questions and suggestions. Fantastic. Updating to 5 stars and purchasing lifetime subscription.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,One of the best texting apps for android. The level of customization is unmatched. I also love that you can utilize multiple devices in order to send messages.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Hady Labna,Very nice sms app using it for more than two years I wish only to have the option of saving my blacklist contacts to restore it again after reinstall. I wish this option could be available in the free edition.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Eighmey,"For me, the app works as I expect it to. There may be features I have yet to discover. I'm often looking for better messaging apps but have found no need to switch from Pulse.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Doesn't send pictures. Went back to Textra. when I looked for answers there was an arrogant message from the programmer who stated something to the effect he was a 'one man team' and was wasting a lot of programming time answering messages.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"wish it would privide better tracking of the message. make it easily visible, such as sent, delivered and read. let me know if there is a way to do so know. but it should be easier, already displayed witgout having to press on the message and go to the upper right corner for message details.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I hate the scheduled test message feature. It is not sending the message on the time you schedule it. Unless you open the app. Like duh. What is the purpose of doing the scheduled feature if it not gonna do its purpose.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I been searching for messages app for three weeks and all of those that I found. They all have ads. Pulse hasn't , could have given 10 stars if it was available. Keep up the tremendous work.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The Blacklist option is auto-deleting - i would rather have the option to store them. older messages that have been imported via ""sms backup"" and can be seen in other apps cant be seen here.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,M M,General functionality is operational. Sadly sending text messages to multiple contacts in one go is failing. I believe this is what you would describe as COMPLETE FAILURE.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I really like that you can send text from multiple devices. This is a great app and does exactly what it says it does. My only thing is that the customization is a little lacking but other then that it's great!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joshua Rivera,I like the way you can customize this app to your liking. I have a tablet and a phone that I use on my plan. I am just trying to figure out how to change the default number so I can receive the same text messages on both devices.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"OK, I'm having trouble getting the same Pulse App, that's on my phone, on my computer. The Pulse APP on the phone functions great, but the App I downloaded for the computer has absolutely no content. Any advice.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Haris Fazal,Been a great app until last update when notifications disappeared and it's been days now.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,j s,If you forget your password everything is gone all your messages everything. I purchased lifetime membership now all the message I have all my content gone. Wow and developer says this isn't a big deal and can't blame the app wow.well handcent you can reset no problem and is better more modern. It's for newer smartphones. Very inconsiderate you should give a warning that you will LOSE EVERYTHING and to store password. Again handcent you can reset no problem and better and other apps out there.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I would never spend about $10 on an app, but the experience this provides is way beyond what google messages does. Both the biggest app purchase i have ever made and one of the best purchases I have ever made!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I swapped to Pulse from Google Messages because I couldn't stand the smiley face icon in their SMS text box. Any way how do you Mark all as Read? In the help is says click on the double check mark. However, this seems to have been removed (double check icon) in an update as I don't see it anywhere.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"FINALLY, a cross-platform, full text (SMS, MMS) app that WORKS, and does so with SOPHISTICATION. Thanks, Pulse. And thanks for offering it Ad-free & free of DATA COLLECTION - at really reasonable fees! WELL DONE!! 😊",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ren Tyler,"I love it when it works. Enough so that I bought a lifetime membership a few years ago. For the past week, it hasn't worked. Also, group texts haven't worked for well over a year. I emailed the developer about it and never received a reply. My advice is to try it. If it works for you, you'll probably be really happy. When it works for me, I'd give it a solid 4 stars. It hasn't been working, so I'm giving it 2 stars until it's fixed.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Exceptional. You guys won me over from years of Textra, and Android Messages. A fast, fluid app you've constructed. With all the features and customization someone would need. Thank you!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Larry Marriott,Very happy with it. I love the cancel timer in case I accidentally hit the send button. It also syncs with my tablet if I want a larger keyboard or more emoji options.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Good replacement for Google Message App....Lots of options ! Not a fan of the Google Material Design washed out plain white theme. This app looks much better & syncs with Chromebook's & tablets.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I was looking for a smart looking SMS app to change from Google Messages. This allows me to customise the colours to match my changing mood of wallpaper etc. Now that I can remove date filters its just what I wanted.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andy Maslin,"Good app. I really like the ability to have separate notifications for individuals, and I was surprised how often I use the scheduled message feature.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jae Powers,I love this app it works perfect if you're are a small business that does a lot of text message. Being able to text from my laptop makes everything a lot smoother.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Faultless app. Have tried and loved other msg apps but Pulse is at a level all of it's own. Within a day of using free version I purchased lifetime version. Don't hesitate in downloading, you won't look back!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very pleased with this app. Great to know I can send/get mags on phone, tablet and computer and the same history for each contact aslo follows. Has been very dependable and accurate.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Have loved Pulse since shortly after its arrival. I am now experiencing an issue where MMS msgs are being sent randomly long after I sent then originally. Since I send 5-20 at a time it's quite frustrating to the recipient. T-mobile has said repeatedly this is not their issue. Is any information available about what is causing this?,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,ScottK63,Much better than the default messaging app that came with my Android and I really like that I can also send and receive from my PC where I can type faster with all 10 fingers.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Seems to work really well. I use it to synch with the Samsung watch and it does a good job. Cant synch remotely but it does work well via bluetooth.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dion Burke,"Really like how my texts are instantly synced between my tablet, computer, and cell phone. Also, I really like the one time purchased for lifetime updates, which sold me on this app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gary Lawson,"Almost the Perfect ""Free"" app. The only thing that I can find lacking in this app is the ability to see if the recipient has read the message that you sent. Wish I could give 4.9",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stephen Murphey,"Love the ease of use and the customization that you can make to this app. I tend to get bored with look and feel of apps, so Pulse let's me scratch that itch in making changes regularly to mix things up.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Josie Welsy,"Had to uninstall at the beginning of this year 2021. It would no longer send my pics to my recipients, some of my texts wouldn't go through, and it kept asking me to upgrade and pay for it/create a paid acct.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Juli & Nick Kellogg,Excellent customer service and help in figuring things out when there was a hiccup and otherwise have loved the functionality and I've used this app for a few years now and once in awhile will take a look at other apps but none compare.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brock Bakke,This is a case of likely a great programmer that completely fails to deliver and promises. There is no backup system as advertised. Text messages do not back up when transitioning to a new device.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I bought the premium right out the gate and it runs Seemless and flawless with my Note 8 and tablet. Synchronized perfectly and now I can txt and wifi call from either one... Would love more variety in customizing but runs great!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent features! I love the ability to set colors for individual conversations, pin a conversation to the top, and really copy all or part of a message.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love Pulse. Slight learning curve but after using Outlook for a while, this has so many additional features if you take the time to explore and learn it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,E J,"Sometimes this app does not function smoothely. It is better than original sms app for LG. One thing it is missing, is individual ringtone capability for contacts.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robert Wilson,Biggest pet peeve is that God forbid you tilt your phone to the side and it rotates the screen sometimes it will delete our what you wrote in the text field before hitting send. With zero way of getting it back.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Louis J. DeMatteo,"It was good at one time, now I am not getting all of my text messages. Sinking to the windows 10 app not working either. I need to use the dreaded message+ app which in itself does not work for windows either",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ben Willis,"As a pastor, I love the way it allows me to have an unlimited number of folks I'm sending to in group texts. I do wish it allowed me to name my group texts, but even without that I've been very happy with the app. Thank you Klinker!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The app is good and does everything I want in a message app but one. It displays the contents of a new message on the notification panel which is not good for security purposes.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pros are i like the Seamless use on all my devices, phone, tablet and laptop. Can reply in detail while working anywhere. Cons are it doesn't always send attachments correctly.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Karen Leyva,Was working fine until a week or so when it stopped flagging the app that tells me I have an unread text. Looked at all the notifications and don't know why it's not working now. Very frustrating,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jen,Great app with good features. Worth it for the full version. Have left my phone at home and been able to text from a tablet or computer with no problems,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"this app has solved several problems I had with SMS on Android; having to carry multiple phones for personal and work, sms messages from a computer, and backing up messages. genius. worth every penny!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robert Cohen,Worked OK for years. Just factory reset my s20 and now cannot send or receive images. Text sends and receives OK. Spent hours with carrier customer support to no avail. Read and tried all pulse help support. Bye bye pulse.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app. Got it primarily so I could add it to Chromebooks as well as smart phone and very able to sync between them. Works great and like the customizability.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Had so high hopes, but there is always something with these smaller devs tackling complicated (?) apps. Personally i had to go back to regular messages, cause of mms issues. Hopefully it will be fixed in the future.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alien Cleverpig (Alyn Cunningham),"UPDATE: As of 11/2020 at the very least, app is NOT sending MMS properly, if at all. Once I switch to Samsung's native Messages, they'll *usually* send just fine. Will likely note have c to abandon this program 😢",2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jake Ribich,Picture messages are not coming through from multiple iPhone users. I hope this glitch will be fixed soon or I will have to delete it. For work I have to have the ability to get picture messages from my clients. How can it just stop working???,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Switched from Mood messaging to this app about a week ago. Absolutely love it! The interface is user friendly and has all the features. I am so happy to have found this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love this app, being able to msg from desktop. Worked perfectly for 1.5 yrs. Ran into a syncing glitch a few days ago. Developer responded very quickly to my email and got me up and running again. Very satisfied.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"this guy wants u to do all his work for him and is to cheap to actually hire help. customer service is non-existent. what a waste of money!!! this was after my 3rd attempt and no where does it say this does not work with text now numbers. wasted 3 months worth on subscription money,. tell people it doesn't work with text now numbers upfront, refund my 3 months and I'll take down the review",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Hiles,He says he can't change the sound to tell between a regular notification and a text but other sms apps do it. There are other better programs that let you customize each individual contact so you can tell who is texting.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Alexander,"So far it's better than ""just okay..."", so that's actually HUGE since I've been so frustrated with almost ALL of the major players in texting apps such as the '2' ""Messengers"" (why do they allow app-builders to 'copycact' each others' names, totally confusing their users...? I quit using BOTH ""Messenger"" apps bc of this!) - Anyway, this is the best texting app I've used so far...",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Duane Oxford-Baker,Great app! This is everything I was looking for in a text messaging app and more. I tried several apps before finally choosing Pulse. If I had tried Pulse first I would not have looked any further. Thanks! 7/28/20 Update - I wanted to update my original rating. Pulse is not only the best SMS/MMS text messaging app on the market it also has the greatest tech support! I wish Google would allow a higher rating than 5 stars. I give this app a 10 star rating ********** 🏆,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,One Two,Not receiving text messages for almost 12 hours. Unacceptable. I was considering buying their lifetime subscription until my wife was irritated that I didn't return her messages. Switched back to the default android messaging app and I had 32 unread messages. Had to apologize to everyone and I looked silly.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Prickly G,"Sadly, this app fails at its chief mandate: sending and receiving SMS messages. The bells and whistles do not matter when it fails to send messages from the web client, and it misses messages sent to me through SMS. Disappointed.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jakob Guldberg Aaes,"Great app that has replaced my default sms app (Samsung). The delayed send that enables regretting sending, scheduling of messages so people don't think I'm a workaholic in the evening and much much more makes this a great app!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Updated: I could not receive my text messages through this app, even after reading through Pulse's entire help section. I emailed the developer. He essentially explained sms to me said and that I should read the help section again. Although he was prompt in his reply, no actual help was given. He never asked a single question. I have spent 4 hours trying to figure this out. I'm not navigating the help section again if he's not going to provide links or ask questions. Even after I told him to keep my money, and that I was done trying, he kept sending me angry emails. Actual email quote from the developer: ”Honestly, it is people like you that make real developers just go work for giant corporations, instead of making their own software for you.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Everything works with a nice interface. One nice addition would be to have a default color for every new text message (I.E. New texts from unknown numbers are all green),5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Paul Luskey,"Convenient and works well. Could be better polished and run smoother on secondary devices. All in all the benefits outweigh the shortcomings, so I recommend this app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Olson,I had to abandon the standard upgraded google messaging on my ONE+ as it was draining the battery and running hot. Tried pulse and it has been very efficient. Now I have a galaxy S9+ and am still pleased with the pulse app,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Earl P,I feel like something is missing but I can't figure it out.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,J Beu,"Uninstalling because it won't import entire conversation history from default messenger apps. The default messenger actually works well after latest update. Despite the developer response, the app does not import the entire conversation, there is a limit of 500 messages as per their help topic wording",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Mostly great. All of my contacts will but sync and I cannot figure out the pattern. That is really frustrating but for the most part it works well,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,after dealing with a glitchy Android messages..i decided to go with Pulse and haven't looked back. no misses text messages and reliable sms. the web access to text is really handy too. keep up the good work.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel N. Sulle,"Fast, easy and enjoyment",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt J,"""Absolutely Awesome Cool SMS App.""",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,unlike airdroid this app to function forces you to use it's own messenger on the phone. and it could be ok but the messenger is very limited and messy comparing to the default one. there will be no notifications while you are on the phone. so after any call I have to go and check if there was any new texts while I was on a call.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Keith Jenkinson,it does everything it should.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kipley Herr,Works great. Has features that are not available on the messaging apps that are pre installed on the phone. Scheduling is one of these.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Excellent application well worth the money paid especially like the way it syncs very accurately on all devices really well done to the devs on this application definitely don't think twice just pay for the application well worth the money you won't be disappointed.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Better overall from the goog sms app. Missing a 5 star rate because on my Android phone I can't get Pulse to display the green Dot on the home screen launch icon upon new texts. I have to open the app to see the new notification dot on people's names which is annoying. Hoping an update will fix that.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It is still missing a few functional and customization features that need to be added before I would consider it nearly perfect but I understand it is a WIP and what is currently in place is good.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mary Ann T,"I've used Pulse for probably 2-3 years. Not sure if it's a Samsung issue or a Pulse issue, but am having text messages fail to send. This just started in the past week. Both Pulse and Samsung/Android have done updates....",3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Been using a while. This is IMHO the best SMS app out there, however it desperately needs the option to allow custom icons for message groups.

Ive already sent a few messages to the wrong group😛",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Ann Montagna,"Be prepared for spam: Pulse SMS has no spam filter technology. Using other apps, I've been free of spam text messages for years, but since switching to Pulse SMS, spam is again a part of my life. It's a bit tough to be paying $24/year for an app with no spam filtration, which is fast becoming standard even on SMS apps that are free. I need the scheduling features though and so must stick with Pulse until I find an alternative. Average Rating: 3 stars (5 stars for scheduling + 1 star for spam)",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Corby Hettler,"🤯 the app needs you to log in to your account on each device - including your watch - using the input options of the device (in my case a Samsung active). So that was 30 minutes of my life, that I will never get back. You know how you get so mad you want to punch someone in the face?

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Lee,"Well, it was good while it lasted. I installed it so I could text on my PC but that no longer works and it looks like I need to buy a subscription to use the only feature I installed it for. I guess all good things must come to an end.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Be'elza Bob,A better txting app. Still has some bugs to fix but much better then most. The in app camera doesnt like to work most of the time. But they did fix sending downloaded pics.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Brown,So far so good. App works well. I had to pay $20 for a subscription but I believe it's worth it. I understand that the developers need to make money. Also to have the convenience of no adds and private conversations is very nice 🙂 👍,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This neatly solves the issue of sms from non phone devices and makes some hat tip to being as private as sms is capable of, which is not very but at least no one is able to read them on their server or mine data from them until it gets to the other guys compromised device.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Cousin Benson,"The same as most on here. It does not separate contacts in to the groups that they are such as Friends, Others etc. but just gives a long list of them all. Not good. Still the same. Even when the developers are told they do nothing about flaws.",2

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Has been a solid messaging app for quite a while. I love the rich theme customizability. For now, I've switched to Android Messenger to test drive RCS. Once Pulse incorporates it, I will happily switch back.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shayne “JAW” Whayne,I only got this app for the scheduled auto send messages feature. Works great! Only thing I'm concerned with is if the scheduled messages are backed up.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Katherine McNarie,"Haven't used this app long, but so far it's the best!! Have tried chomp, Google, mood, and verizon. Each had something that annoyed me after a bit of time. ***UPDATE*** 10 months later I'm still loving this app!! Can't live without it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Murphy,I love this app but sometimes things go wrong all settings erase or I gotta re download and start from scratch. Great app best app when it works but too reset every.person and colors again and ringtones is annoying,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,well i had the defult message app from Google and after the orio update it started to play up so i did a fresh reset which i didnt want to do well anyway the app worked ok again for a little while then i wasnt getting my messages so i looked around and found this app. all i can say is thankyou very much for building this app it has never faulted since ive installed it about 4 weeks ago and still working spot on. thumbs up the the dev team and as its free im gunna buy the pc one many thanks :),5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Greatly appreciate this app's quality of display especially not spreading incoming messages over multiple paragraphs. Still trying to access app from other platforms. Which begs the question why not use YouTube to show your new users how to use some of advanced functions and telling all users what your new updates will improve.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Becks E,Mostly purchased this app to be able to text from my computer. Syncs great with my android galaxy note. and I can easily send gifs or quick pulse to send short texts or photo shares.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lou Brush,"It does what I'd expect really well. I object to the subscription system and a high 'lifetime' cost for a simple SMS app hence the 3 stars. What does 'lifetime' even mean, am I guaranteed that this app will be updated for every phone I'm ever going to own now?",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Google User (M. B.),False advertising. There's nothing free about this app. It won't send any sms without a paid subscription. all they want is access to your contact list so they can sell it. Uninstalled and reported,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jen F.,"Easy to use and clean look, without losing helpful features. Like being able to schedule messages for the future. Well done!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Enjoying Pulse - its way better than the plain Messages app across different platforms. It would be nice if people's photos appeared next to their text bubbles like Messages, though.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Randal Green,"recently it's been just closing on it's own , mid text",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ven,"Capable and customizable. Really liking it. I only wish it had integrated support for animated gif search and attachments like other messaging apps have (GIPHY, etc).",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I absolutely love & enjoy this app! 100%. The only issue I have is that I still can't figure out how to connect with my Chromebook. I know I made an account yet it tells me wrong sign in. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you~,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,michael montez,For me the Pulse SMS app is easy to install and use. I have had no issues nor glitches with it. I think it to be superior to the sms app that came with my phone.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jake Wagner,"Used to be great but won't let me send MMS for the past few months (since upgrading to galaxy s20). Other apps work fine, it's only pulse that doesn't work right.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kara Oberst,Not really working well for me. Doesn't work at all when I travel and have internet but not cell phone service. When I have my tablet and internet but my phone is out of power it also doesn't send texts.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,lamar washington,The whole reason why I got this app was to sync text messages with my Galaxy smartwatch. It does not sync to my SmartWatch. It's not worth the $20 a year they're asking.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brandon Delle Chiaie,Will only send picture messages in group messages... Not individual messages UPDATE: fixed picture messaging issues. Now application crashes dozen times per day immediately after pressing send button,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Renee Smarty,"Hi Maple Media, re your response to my review, no thankyou I do not want to send another email to Maple Media. As mentioned in my first review, my last encounter with your Support was not pleasant and I don't wish a revisit thanks. I see that the majority of replies to reviews on here are a cut & paste job ""Sorry to read that, that's not how the app should behave"" etc. So there's another element of customer service that's disappointing. I've moved on thanks and cancelled my subscription.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Works very well. my phones msg app came defected but I have had nothing buy good service from Pulse. I guess i do wish it had a voice to text feature. But that's a minor thing.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The one thing I dont like is the fact that once Im in the app texting one I have to go out of the app and start all over. When in the app the back button does nothing to go back like other apps. Please fix it, thanks",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Paul J. Martinelli,I've used this texting app for over one year and it's been very useful and has important features that the stock app will never have. It's reliable and efficient.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,great app. Would love to see a features to turn off notifications for private messages. Tested it today & you don't seem to need a passcode when accessing them through notification.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Calvin Richardson jr,"I have a serious problem. The app asked me to upgrade to get the new swipe read/unread feature. When I did, it asked me to login again. Once I logged in my entire text history disappeared. How do I get it back? I had important information in it.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Has everything I was looking for: GIF support (w/ Gboard), quick reply capability, & no ads at the top of the message thread that trick you to click them by magically appearing 1 second after you open the app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Works well, has a dark mode which is nice, can change colors by conversation, and the ability to schedule messages for certain times is a really nice feature",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Glenn Ross,"Does everything I would expect from a good messaging app. Only problem is that it keeps receiving messages that I have already received, sometimes from days earlier. Sometimes the same message over and over. Fix this problem and it's 5 stars",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It is a good mesaging app with the ability to group message. But it takes some getting used to. Some group messages are still not coming through.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cody,"Love it! The ability to message from my phone, PC, and Galaxy Watch really has me sold on the app. I subscribed to the lifetime membership of the app and have no complaints. Highly recommend!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"it's another text operation. some respects is better than the other ones, on the other hand it's hard to figure out where the Emojis are. I'm just getting used to it. It has been about 3 weeks since I've had it and I'm still getting used to it. It's a new experience but it's not too difficult I'd say it's good for just about everyone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Orlando “the.IceMan” Lockett,Love the app! I'm a techy type person. App doesn't crash and has always been stable. Been using for a long time and my only replacement over the stock message app. 😁Great job to the developers!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I really want to like this app but it constantly gives me a notification to write a new message. This is so annoying. I can't turn the notification off. I will write when I'm ready. I don't need your app telling me to over and over.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Павел Павлович,I tried 4 messaging apps because the Google stock Android app was just too bad and settled on Pulse. Best one so far. Works fine out off the box. I haven't been troubled by ads so far..,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,an excellent app. functions properly. is fast and with options to custom tailor to a user's personal touch is right on par. Good job.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Just found out I haven't been receiving picture messages for a few weeks. And for the last few days mine haven't been sending. Had to switch back it the default app,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Easy to use, and helps keep conversations organized. Especially appreciate the ability to lock individual conversations and keep them private.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Why so highly rated? You can barely customize swipes, with group texts it doesn't split up Contact pictures. It's very average unless I'm missing something.",2

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Doesn't run quite as smooth as the default SMS app that was in the X⁴. Also didn't let me send photos or videos. Had to use default SMS to do that.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kim B (Pookee),"I absolutely love this app!!! I pay for the premium, so I don't get bombarded with ads. You don't have to worry about losing your msgs if you switch carriers. Highly recommend!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeff Worley,"Excellent replacement for the built in SMS app. Good looking UI, lots of customization very strong feature set. The best text messaging app I have used.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Adams,"For the last month or so, the conversation list totally depopulates and I need to either close the app completely or navigate to a different menu in the sidebar and back in order for my conversations to reappear.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love it! I like the way names are selected and added to the list of recipients. Search within a single conversation is terrific! Niicely done!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Timothy Phoenix,"Pulse was a great app. Unfortunately no one has received my pictures in months, they just won't send over the platform even though it shows sent. Only seems to work to other Pulse users",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Best messaging app I've found. I would pay a small fee for it. I would try more fee for service apps if they came with a 3 day trial.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Karl Nitzl,"Good alternative to the native app, lacks features. In my mind, should be able to forward to email or to another contact.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,prokofiev opus19,It's been dependable though other SMS apps indeed also free among those are dependable as well. What's different with Pulse for my experience and concern is it's design aesthetic quality ---,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,M S,"This app does what other texting apps do not, such as assigning different colors and individual notification tones to my favorite texters. It's a dependable app with many solid and useful features.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Have had no problems with pulse, actually solved an issue that i was having with my factory sms app of not receiving pictures. Simple,clean and full of features.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Lendi,"I've been having issues sending pictures to certain people, I can receive them, but not successfully send them. So I had dropped this from 5 to 3 star Edit : fixed! Thank you",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,pocky bully,latest update seems to make sending messages more unreliable. I more often get send failures.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sally,So far I really like this app. I would give it five stars if the alert on your lock screen would show more than one line. And the ability for the alert to stay on a little longer than what it does.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love how Pulse integrates with my desktop. Following a clean and simple setup I realized I could process texts reliably and completely in a desktop window. Keeping hands-on my desktop is the feature of Pulse that justified my purchase. The increase in my desktop productivity made this purchase a no-brainer.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Carolyn Wilbon,"Not sure what has happened, but since last week, 75% of my texts fail to send on the first try. It seems to get worse every day. Today I'm having to resend 3-4 times!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Well done, no ads, nice features. i especially like the option to add a few second delay/cancel after hitting ""sent"" - it could save my marriage...",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lazy Boy,"You didn't understand my query. Suppose, My friend sent me 7 messages (4 on sim1 and 3 on sim2). This app can't show me which message has arrived on sim1 and which on sim2. But many other apps in playstore like qksms, textra, Google messages are able to show this. Hope you'll fix this and inform me.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app just fixed my biggest problem with any SMS app. I can copy just any part of any message, and not only the entire message, like for example with the stock app. Live it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,CALEB PEREZ,"Really gives me options to do whatever I want. My favorite feature is being able to schedule messages for a later time, I don't know why every messaging app doesn't do that",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I find this app flawless in the one thing I most needed - being available on all platforms, easy to use, very lightweight, and so intuitive I never needed to look at the help section. Thank you for this.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Works well as a standard messaging app. You can copy messages, etc. very well. But it falls short when you go multi-device.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cam Bowman,"I liked a lot of the features of this app. However, in the last few weeks I have missed scores of critically important messages that just never showed up on my phone. IMO not reliable enough.",2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Valeria Palumbo,Schedule text! I mainly got the app to schedule send text messages. It works great. Have it was my default text app without problems. I do recommend.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"When this app is functioning it's great, but after a recent outage and buggy performance/integration with browser-based messaging, I'll trade some of the Pulse features for the stability of other clients.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Clark Bickers,"Pulse SMS is the best messaging app I've found so far, and I've tried a bunch of them! Runner-up for me would be Signal, but I like that Pulse allows groups of more than 10 at a time.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A great app, well organized and intuitive. I love the colour options and contrast as well, and the notifications that come in conversation view.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED. This is the second time that I try to inform Pulse support about several dysfunctions with Pulse app : 1. No synchronisation of some messages within my tablet. 2. Just bought a new smartphone. No possibility to log in: I don't remember my password... Why there's no link to reset a new password through email? I'm sorry but if I still don't have any feedback or answer from you, I will report to Google play services and will ask for refund",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've been using Pulse for about a year now and love it. After fumbling with some of the competition, I've found pulse to be the most consistent for texting via web/pc.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,No One,"Buyers beware: this company is somehow erasing negative reviews (my previous review is no longer online). I have been using Pulse for more than three years. Suddenly my ""lifetime subscription"" is no longer valid and I have no access to years of archived texts I thought were ""safe in the cloud"" for future access. What was once a great app is now owned by an untrustworthy company.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Easy app to use both on your phone and computer. Wouldn't be without it and would definitely recommend for home and small business communications.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Not good enough. No notification received for service sms from banks, ISP, MF, LPG, Govt. etc. I can see new messages only when I open the app. Personal conversation sms notification is available only. If this is corrected, I will download it again as my default message app and give 5⭐. Thank you.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Clover Kismet (Shining Asteriscus Luck),"Been using it for the past year as it allows me to preschedule text messages. This app is great, and I've had no issue with it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app is so much better than my Google app that was pre-installed on my device. I miss some Gif's but over all easy to add and I can finally get all group mssgs regularly. Also I appreciate the different color changes for people.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Clint Urbanoski,Only four stars because I receive a second MMS message a few days after sending the first one. I've done all the recommendations to stop it from happening but it still happens.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app shows to block unknown number calls. But it doesn't allow or show there these mobile number are stored. I accidentally blocked one of my contract and now unable to unregister from the blocked list.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Spencer Morgan,"It's really clean, you can see what you responded to earlier to keep up the conversation outside the app and you can schedule messages if you are a bit timid.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great messaging app, but the one feature it absolutely lack is to mark random SMS as spam. This is especially the case with the raise of fraudulent scam messages in the modern age of technology.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app is awesome! It has all the functionality of Textra plus the ability to use with my other gadgets. I would have no problem paying considerably more than what this amazing service costs! (Motorola X4/Motorola E4/Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2016),5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Good but I have MMS problems. I never receive pictures people send me and people never receive images I send them. I have tell them to send it via messenger which is lame. Any reason why this is happening? I've check the settings and everything looks good to me.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Mostly love it. The app has many great features and functions, my only hiccup is that sometimes I experience difficulties sending and receiving pics.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've been using Pulse SMS for a good two weeks now and so far I like it a lot (definitely more than Google Messenger). I have no real complaints so far, but I won't give it 5 stars unless I've used it for an extended period of time and still have no issues.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Did not approve purchase, tried via developer, Pay Pal and Google Play to get refund to no avail. It DOES NOT work from my tablet and many messages don't go through. They took my money, I would never pay for a messaging app, its a basic, free, function on the phone",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bruce Edwards,"What I was looking for. Very configurable, delay message send up to 15 seconds, clean design, as they say, just works! Worth the money. A+",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Peter Sharp,"An exceptional app. It actually works as claimed! It's excellent, so much so that after just a short period of use, I bought the 'lifetime' licence. It works perfectly on my W10 tablet & Linux Mint laptop. Support the development & buy, you won't be disappointed.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Text from browser function does not work. I followed all set up steps and troubleshooting ideas with no luck. Asked for refund from developer and stop receiving responses. Waste of $10.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,CK3,This would be my app if I could record then hear and replay a voice message before actually sending it. That feature is mandatory so Textra is my choice until this happens.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Very good with some interesting features within the app. * day and night backlight * text being read back * choose your own screen colours * informing you when text is delivered Would be an extra bonus if the emojis came to life!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Princess Buttercup,"best texting app even if you somehow dont care about privacy/security/encryption. however, if sending sensitive info i like a different app better, i don't think i should name it, but i only use it for Confiding legitimately personal info. this is my default messaging app (and I've tried a lot!)",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Good app - love the feature to mark messages ""unread"". Timestamps on messages are difficult to read though. Limited customization. Overall a good sms app though.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tammy De La Garza,I love that you can select different sound notifications for individual and groups. That helps me know if it is important to look at an incoming text.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Makes texts more organized and searchable. Also has a quickshare function that works when sharing pictures. Worth the $10 lifetime subscription.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Danny Pacheco,Great messenger. Handles group threads much better than other clients I've used and the link preview feature is neat. Desktop client works well but requires a subscription.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel H,Better than the built in messaging app on my phone. Although I don't like how links don't automatically open to an external browser.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,W S II,Pulse is the first app that I download when I get a new phone. I love being able to save all of my messages in one place and not lose them. Also I can access the app via a web browser if I need to.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,C C,I live just about everything with this app I bought it a couple of years ago and have never regretted it....I enjoy the colors the clarity of text ...that I can still swipe text ...and the animations.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brenda Lyvers,I love that I can pin my most common contacts to the top for easy access. I also paid the one-time fee to be able to access texts online and print them out if needed. That is handy for me as a teacher to keep paper copies of communications with parents.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mario Gutierrez,Generally very good messaging app but i have had some issues with links in a text not working and last update forced me to uninstall and reinstall all over again as app would crash immediately on open.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I'm always having trouble when someone sends me a picture message lately, sometimes I get them a day later when they send them to me or not at all and I have to use my original messenger app. I mean I paid for this app so it sucks I invested my money on an app that is very inconsistent.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Captain Howard,"Minimal but efficient. Provides all of the basic text messaging functionality required. After trying a few other text messagening apps, Pulse is the best.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lin Dimpfl,I like this app. I have it on my cell and tablet so I can send/receive on my tablet. One issue. The messages on my cell do not always sync witj my tablet and I have not been able to find out why and what to do.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"i loved this app but now i am receiving mms messages 2 or 3 times days later. i have tried everything proposed on the help site, but nothing has worked. I do not hace this issue with any other app, so I know its not on my or my providers end as suggested. Fairly fristrating as I had to pay for it and now cant use it",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Cannot be happier with this app. Does everything you want out of a messaging app and does it elegantly. Documentation is on point and dealing with issues is simple and straightforward. A true gem. Just download it and thank me later!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Doesn't support RCS.  If a message is received as RCS it doesn't show up in pulse.  Couldn't figure out why the app was missing so many messages.  Pretty much makes it worthless, and my device does not allow me to disable RCS.  Wish I had known this before paying for a lifetime membership.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mario Tuccitto,"Easy to use, minimal glitches, lots of fun options to message people and the image transfers have great resolution. This messaging app is a workhorse!",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Amber Rowe,"I loved EvolveSMS, and this is the same people. It allows me to customize messaging and go things the native app doesn't. Only thing I wish it did was let me slide between messages. I got spoiled on that.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,jp,Not anything so awesome anymore. It used to be a lot better and more responsive to requests. Now it seems to be in the dust bin of Android history. Still good but unfortunately these days there are better. Back in my day it was the premier sms and mms messaging app.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sarah Blumenstock,I love this app! The best part is that it works internationally via wifi! What an incredible surprise to get texts while in airplane mode on public transit in some obscure town in Poland!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Only had this app a couple of weeks and am loving it! I gave 4stars instead of 5 because it has crashed several times. I'm holding out hope it will be addressed because I really do like this platform.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like this messaging app better than the preloaded versions in my phones, love the web app so I can use at my computer (with full phone history), scheduling text messages, pinning favorites to top.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Like it! 😊 Works just fine. Missing a few features but sure the developers will catch up. Its fast and the UI is awesome.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris Kelley,Been using this app for years now. I love the ability to message from all of my various devices! Also the individual chat customization options are very robust.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,You just aren't gonna get a better SMS experience than from Pulse. Everything works perfectly and it runs BETTER THAN ANDROID MESSAGES. Excellent development. 10/10 would use again.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe Raymond,Does what it sets out to do. Can't say that for many other apps. Works good no problems hooking up to tablets and PC so I can check messages on multiple platforms.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Ads are not in the way every 2 minutes as for Go SMS, interface is lean and easy to use. No fuss whatsoever. Love it!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is the app I've been looking for for years! Where have you been? Multi platform, scheduled messaging, pinning conversations, folders. My texting productivity is at max with this one!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mit Manta,"Every month you are doing the same, with my subscription. You take my money and after that you dont let me enter in the web app. And every time need to loose time trying to contact you, and waiting for an answer. What kind of monthly ""subscription"" is that?",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Better than any message service i have used in the past. Not sure if my bubbles are blue or green lol! Any way it is easy to use and available on all of my devices.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank Summers,The app works great. All the necessities with the extra needed and unneeded bells and whistles that don't interfer with functionality.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Skowronski,"Right now I'm using it, but it could be better. Searching text messages on my computer is my greatest need and this app frequently fails to find what is in my messages. Yet on the phone I can search and find them.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,G Vilches,"This app is so useful for those that text a lot, I love the schedule feature, and the best part is that this app is a one time purchase not like other desktop text messaging apps.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph J,It doesn't work. It puts popups in the way and constantly asks me to set it to the default SMS app after it has already been set. I will never give this company a single cent of my money.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"a reliable app with features better than default messaging installed. just a bit issue on group SMS, cannot access on other contacts. overall, great experience.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tara Carrin,It works! I have a Galaxy S8 and I'm so glad to finally have a text messaging app that delivers all my incoming and outgoing texts. What a relief.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Father Phipps,"It adds message scheduling to my OnePlus 5t. No ads as far as I can see, and the premium cloud backup is tempting me. Swapping phone to phone and never missing a beat? Maaaaaybe.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The function I like the most is being able to schedule a time to send a text. If you know are going to be busy when you need to remind the hubby to leave for an appointment you can write the message and schedule it to be sent while you are enjoying a glass of wine with the girls. Love this app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan O'Shaughnessy,Great app - I especially like how you can mark messages as unread and go back to them later. The web platform for sending messages from your laptop is also very handy.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This sms app is fast. Others have slowed the whole phone down. After installing this, my phone is zippy again. Also, map gps links open properly, others take the comma and break the link.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christopher Bagwell,"I've loved this app for a long time but suddenly haven't been able to send messages. Every message I try to send returns ""failed"". Not sure what's up but this has been going on for days.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Anita Laffey,"This is a practical, easy text system. I especially appreciate the scheduling feature--few other apps provide it. I am very pleased with Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like this a lot. I hate that you have to pay for stuff though. I wanna keep using Pulse but I don't wanna pay, which means I can't use the app on my smartwatch. That really sucks. I don't want to pay at all but I really like how Pulse works on my phone. Satisfied on my phone. Very dissatisfied for my watch",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Leighton Perkins,"Has pretty much everything, I like the delayed send option being a hot head at times I can stop the text from going out, and sometimes I send pictures or memes to the wrong person, it's a big help",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Blair Stanifer,"Rating only to stop the incessant pop-up that keeps asking my to rate. Great for SMS, but I find that MMS doesn't work as well as the standard Android text app.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Leigha Chantrose,"Very reliable after about a year of use. Looks nice, exception being the emojis, they're ugly, but a very small gripe for a very good app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Elias Mburu,"Very smooth. My best is scheduled sms. However, I noted I had scheduled an early morning sms daily, but if I have not opened the sms app it will drlay sending. What I mean is, I scheduled 6a.m sms. When I wokeup at 6.30a.m thinking the sms was sent, I checked if I have other messages and that id when the message was sent",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app but with new Link to Windows app I can text from my pc or Samsung device for free. The standard messaging app on Samsung has better theme support. It would be nice if this app could support more visual customisation.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This worked well on my  oneplus6 and wear24 smartwatch. I ran out of storage on my watch and had to make the difficult choice to remove pulse and use the native sms app instead.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,everything works fine but it would not let me send a message. I kept hitting the send button but nothing happened. Also there was no way for me to start a new conversation with anyone else. the interface is questionable,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,L K,"This app is beautiful and was superbly functional. However, after updating it is useless. Missing lots of texts. Will try uninstalling and reinstalling before contacting Devs directly. Thx for replying Devs.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse is the absolute best sms app. There's no bloat which seems to be a thing with all the other sms apps. The features and settings are perfect.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Erik Ehresman,This really had all the features I needed and more. It inegrated seamlessly into the phone with no issues. It is a huge improvent to the stock sms app that came with the phone!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,S B,edit* I happen to see that I gave it 4* and fixed it. While the recovery seems a little clunky when I last looked. I've never had a problem and I love this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bruce Polikoff,Does not work on Lenovo m series tablets. Must force stop and clear cache and data on a pretty regular basis. Also not synchronizing on PCs. Functionality is regressing. And this is a paid for app?,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is trash, I tried to use the schedule a text message feature at 4 a.m. to send a text for 9 a.m. and it sent the message out immediately! The text was to my supervisor about my attendance at a job.....got me half a point at work.....no good!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,spencer apple,"a mostly good experience, wish backup was easier, more secure like having the ability to download old messages (correct me if im wrong) on phone without linking a laptop.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I have the first generation pixel and the original message app always glitches so this one came in handy and also works great. i love that i can change the colors of different conversations.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tripp Smith,I have used this app for a long time. I quit but am back using it now. I use the paid version so I don't receive ads of which some have spoken. I do find this app is more functional than Messages for Web.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Got a pic that wasn't sent by sender. To verify I used their phone took a screenshot and sent it to my phone and once again it was something else. A photo that someone else had sent me last week that I deleted. They are obviously keeping our pics.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tom Brose,"In general I like this app. However, it's clearly deleting messages despite making the ""clean up"" advanced setting ""Never"". That's simply unacceptable and will force to to look elsewhere.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse is an excellent SMS tool. Very reliable. I've never had a problem. It has great features like the ability to foward messages. You should give it a try.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Vance Jarvis,been using a long time. like using it between PC and phone. Never really have had any issues with it. Support has been good also. I don't do reviews but I did this time.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Yogesh Jeronia,"everything is good but new messages in notification shows along with the previous messages so tracking new messages in the notification becomes quite complex, hope this can be fixed, rest is all good.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Anika Kelso,"Mostly syncs well, but sometimes is hard to get to sync changes to contacts. Otherwise, love that I can type my texts from my computer!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've been using this app for some time now and I must say that its a highly recommended app to everyone who loves great customization. Plus the fact that it has private conversation feature in which you have a secured password. Great job!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This one is a nice SMS app but the only problem is the messages are still in your inbox after being deleted/archived even without undoing it. I hope this one will be fixed soon..,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gretchen Briggs,In the middle of a group text the Pulse SMS app stopped transmitting and receiving group texts. Not good! Single person texting works great but if you group text...beware!!,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Abel Lozano,"I went ahead and subscribed to the service, this app works very well on my phone, my laptop and both of my Samsung tablets. It's fast and very intuitive. I love it, so far so good.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Does what it should with no hassle. Live the simplicity. Syncs much better than the competitor I'd been using for a couple years. Very glad to have found this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Julie Avina,The app has been great! I love having the extra 10 seconds when sending a message. I am a horrible texter. I often have to fix a lot of what I say.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,N x,"I love this app. The stock SMS app on my S9 was so bad it was unusable, so I was really glad to find this one. Been using it for over two years now with almost no problems. Thanks very much for preventing me throwing my phone out the window!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"On the whole good,just the occasional blip when my mobile isnt receiving enough light to get an accurate reading,but it lets you know ! Otherwise 5.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Best messaging app by far. I carry two phones and a computer at all times and this app gives me extreme flexibility by keeping them all synced with my texts.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The only thing I didn't like was the heads up notifications only pop up for about 3 seconds and the close. That's hardly enough time to read and then respond. Other than that, it's fine.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Carter,"Much better than other text apps. Lot more friendly useable. There more options within the app to separate read, unread, and group mail.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Justin,I love this messaging app especially since there's no ads but my only gripe is that it is unable to compress gifs. If that could be fixed then it would 10/10 easy.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is the best messaging app hands down. I love that it can sync across devices. The options are great, I can customize it just to my liking",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Denise Taylor,"Easy to install and use. Had to install it first on my phone, then on each tablet. Works great. Messages+ kept crashing on my new tablet.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,app doesn't support previous messages before its installation. and many of the new text messages were not received. I installed this app yesterday but only in few hours of installation I realized that this app is not suitable for text messaging.... because in emergency conditions it will sink you.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love the conversation management. Much better than default android messages. However, I have experienced some flakey performance with multimedia messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,The Last Bastion,"Great SMS app for android phone but total flop for WearOS. You have to have your watch connected to wifi in order to receive a sms, otherwise the pulse sms simply does not work on watch. Lame.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Best SMS app out there, next to Textra which eventually failed to send/receive messages at all. But Pulse is just as customisable and has been rock solid.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is close to what I wanted in a messaging app. The only thing missing is the ability to lock specific messages within a convo, so when deleting an entire convo the locked messages will not be deleted.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The only thing thats not good about this app is the notification. If for example i get a new message, it still shows the old message in the notification which is lame. Specially it for example im expecting an OTP from my bank, i usually peek at the notification to immediately get it but the notification still shows the threaded message. Only show the new message in the notification and ill change it to 5 stars",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Damn close to perfect. Certainly the best cross-platform sms messaging app I've found, with lots of granular customization and reliable syncing.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've had this app for a few months and I've already failed to receive 3 messages that were sent to me and ive confirmed that those messages were indeed sent to me. This has caused communication issues with those individuals - i will be uninstalling this app.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,James S,I love the privacy aspect of the app and it was what made me pay to get it on my smartwatch. But the smartwatch app is not very effective and drags it down. But other than that is just as good as google with privacy,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Have been using for quite some time. App is now way too slow. Takes about five or ten seconds to send a message when I try to send. Also doesn't open links. I am done.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So easy to use. Far outclasses the old Messenger. Allows scheduling of message delivery, fast delivery of preset texts. Excellent all ways around.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michelle,This was definitely worth the purchase a few years ago. I can have private messages about my kids driving me crazy with homeschool and they can't accidentally read them when they're playing on my phone. The best part is using finger print to access them.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Schmidt,"I wanted a message app with persistent notification so I don't miss texts, as the standard app on Moto G5+ didn't do that. Besides getting that the app works great and I love the connection to my laptop so i can text from that too. good app works well",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alesia Bodkin,Great app I like that I can link it to my computer and it works better than Google messages which I had previously been using until it froze up and stopped working. I did pay the fee for lifetime use after the trial because I liked it so much!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Really impressed with this app, so many great ideas, like being able to block messages, being able to write a message n send it at a specific time. Great work",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,MICHAEL MERRITT,Been using Pulse SMS for years ! LOVE IT !,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Susan Stuppnig,Sometimes sends messages. Sometimes does not. But it doesn't always let you know if it doesn't send. Bummed because there is so much to like about this messaging app...,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's working perfectly before, but recently some of my messages appears to be sent but apparently my recipients did not received any. 😕 BTW, good customization options.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeff Launiere,"Works fantastic, and I love the fact that you also can text from your computer, and the fact you can archive conversations, which so many apps do not have.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I took off one star because syncing between different platforms is below expectation. There has been constant delay when using desktop to send out messages,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,J. Richard Kirkham B.Sc. Fast Computer Tips,Does exactly what it says it's going to do. I use this with my computer to check my SMS text messages and love the fact that it does not use data. Website's backup ignore my review below. I'll go with four stars because there is no 2FA,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ethan blohm,Works better than the default pixel app and with little anoyance as it occasionally will ask you to upgrade to the payed version. Has excellent customizability for a free app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tom Adams,"The latest update is a disaster. It now wants account sign in, payments, etc etc. It's a shame that another decent app has gone down this unfortunate road. I hope it can be restored to its previous high standard.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"l like the UI, and more importantly it's reliable . I seem to get all the texts unlike another app I tried. Also, group chat works nicely unlike the default app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,nenabella b,My text messages are not showing up I've checked all notifications setting on the app and my phone and pulse Is the only one not showing up I'm also paying for my sms+ but it's not showing to upgrade what am I paying for then if I need to upgrade?

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Had the app for more then a year. It's great and never had a issue but I changed to a Xiaomi phone and Pulse SMS doesn't work well with MIUI (Doesn't receive pics from text.) Great app but not for MIUI.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Newest update caused an issue that blocked mms and sent a long string of random characters. All incoming sms texts were also appended with a shorter string of random characters.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love this app. It's the only one I've found that effectively supports dual SIM and has other useful features, like sharing messages to other apps.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Randy Griffin,Loved this on my phone and desktop but just loaded it on my Samsung Galaxy Watch Classic and no joy. All I see is a white screen and no functions. Help! I don't want to go back to Samsung messages if I don't have to.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ron Holliday,"Great app. Easy to use, easy to erase, very accurate except for occasional problems with sending attachments.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kenny Dorsey,Had a hard time finding a texting app that was compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. This one is working great so far! No hiccups to speak of yet.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Elaine Kymer,It is fairly easy to use for senior citizens. This is my first smart phone & Pulse is user friendly with a lot of features. I have now used it for a year & have had no problems with it. I really like it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jo Esman,"I was enjoying this app until the update 2 days ago at which time it no longer worked with Android auto instead when I tried to play a message while driving I got the error message ""Android auto does not support this app"" ☹️",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Works well (Ext for Chrome). Wish it would work with my Google Contacts and user groups (labels) i already have setup. Also an option to pick users (and groups) from Outlook would be good.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,dipa sultana,Very very useful sms app,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I am going to start off with three stars for now I would like to increase it I do like the fact that I can delay a text just because of my weird schedule it really does help I don't like sending texts to people at midnight or 1:00 AM. I tried out sending this text this morning I wrote it about 1AM send out at 6:30 he received it and responded perfectly. Do you have a way to block texts from Robo callers,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim Angerole,Been using Pulse for about 2 years. Convinced my wife to switch and she likes the ability to schedule messages. Very easy to use and nice features.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Closest thing to imessage us android users will get. Very clean interface packed with useful features and customizability. No other messaging app comes close good job!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jessica Clark,"App just stopped working. I have this app because it works well with my fossil watch. This weekend it just stopped receiving my texts. I didn't even know it. No updates out, nothing. And I paid for the app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rachael Connally,"Aesthetic and highly functional. I prefer Pulse over any other SMS interface. I love the features that Pulse provides, such as hyperlink previews and colorful options.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Virginica Doina Datcu,It meets my expectations! I linked my phone and my tablet and they sync correctly. The only performance issue is with my tablet where Pulse is a little lazy.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"non-supportive developer who will remove himself from any issues of compatibility telling you to deal with it yourself.  As an update to respond to the developer's comment.   The developer first claimed that it was a system level functionality and nothing he could change.  I brought up the concrete fact that other 3rd party apps are recognized by Android Auto's voice prompts just fine, he went on to say that if there's issues it isn't with the app.  Clearly a non-factual answer.  In an earlier support issue with regards to a browser, the developer had again went on to say - not my app, take it up with the browser developers.  Compatibility is a cornerstone of any decent app and any responsible developer would hold that near and dear to widen the audience as much as possible.  This developer instead chooses to use - not my problem as his go to response.  I can't recommend anyone purchase this app that has middle of the road functionality and grossly inadequate support.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great application for all location texting. I am having some issues with opening messages with linked content. Other then that performs as promised.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"WARNING: When this app is unistalled then reinstalled, all private conversation saved become exposed! i have a premium pulse account. aside from messages all configurations or settings should have been backed up. whats the use of keeping a conversation private when someone other the i owner can just uninstall and reinstall the app to check on you private messages.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,S Clark,"Text messages seem to repeat themselves 24-48 hours after being received. It's quite annoying.

Don't want to pay a small monthly fee? Down load a free phone phone number from another app then attach it to that number . Bing bang",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sam Rivera,It's been amazing! Love it better than all the messaging apps. Basically iMessage for Android devices! I have it downloaded on my computers as well. I recommend this to everyone!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Drew,Good but needs work. Needs 2fa for new device access to your messages. Also need the ability to set a specific sim card to use as default or exclusively. Other than that it's not bad.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Lorn Roberts,I signed up for the lifetime texting it stopped working. the reset not only didn't work but erased that I had the feature I paid for. the app is fine except for that I got hosed on the the only feature I was interested in.,1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Kevin Stringer,Bought the lifetime membership but I cannot message from my PC now; the messages just say sending and never send. edit: They reached out to me and let me know they upgraded their servers. Seems to be working again.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I'd give this app -5 stars if I could. It's run by an amateur by the name of Luke Klinker who never bothers replying to emails. The app is full of bugs – including not being able to blacklist contacts. I've tried to raise this issue with Luke for the past year, but he clearly couldn't care less. My advice is to give this app a wide berth – try a real SMS app like Textra instead. Pulse is not fit for purpose.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great messaging app, turned to after Samsung Android updaten that stopped ability to block by subject content. I have not had any issues and happy to recommend.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Phil Jackson,Very reliable. I like being able to read and write android SMS from a desktop browser as well. Keeping message history as I upgrade my phone works well too,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I'm very thrilled with this app - upon leaving Apple and iMessage, I was really looking for something LIKE it and I feel like this app is just about it. It's amazing in so many ways, give it a try. I bounced from Samsung's msg app to Verizon's and I'm thoroughly loving Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christopher Gennai,"I have used this app for over a year and it it fabulous at meeting my needs. The only thing that I can thing to make it better, would be of there was a way to always ask which sim to use if a preference has not been set.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mikayla Liles,"I have used this for years and it works very well across all devices. I think there is still a lot of room for improvement within the app (hence 4 stars), but my only real complaint is the way the camera works within the app.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse SMS is a very good all round universal app that anyone can use. I find this app to be the best Android can offer. Try it and share it Pulse SMS deserves to be up there amongst the messaging apps available.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Doug S,Works well in tandem with app on PC which is a real time saver when I'm at my desk. The android experience on the phone is very good. UPDATE - continuing to work well as of April 2021.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,H Marie,"$99 lifetime fee, out of your mind. I would truly consider this app & understand the need to be profitable, but that's ridiculous. I know there are monthly & yearly options, but anyone who can gouge like that won't get a dime from me. Good luck",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aaron Elggren,"Looked good if you don't mind not getting random messages. Seriously I don't know how many times I did not know what people were talking about because one of their messages never showed up. Opened up Google messages, and there it was.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Christopher Beaudoin,Stopped supporting the app for my watch with no notice. The app provides no benefit.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Wozniak,taking pics from in pulse app is a little wonky. if you have a Samsung watch paired with a Google phone the messaging app works much better than the native apps - can read old convos on the watch.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matthew Addley,Works well. Subscription adds up over time but the ability to respond to work messages from my PC or my primary phone almost immediately is very convenient.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,sometimes slow on my other Android phone (not primary). Since it's not a real SMS I can't text via TMobile free GoGo service. Still very happy with the service.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,its a good app for what it does. I wish there were more options for graphing to see the data over time but hopefully that will come with later versions probably,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Best messaging app I have ever used. If I could write the code for myself I would probably do one just like Pulse. I am able to use so much more of the processes that is available to me. I use Pulse so much more than I have any other app like it. Thanks you for making an app that doesn't confuse me.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jacob Nasim,The browser window on my computer has trouble updating now and again and has often gotten really slow if there's lots of pictures built up in a particular text thread.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very clean and simple UI, works grest paired with Galaxy Watch app. Small wishlist item that the web version would pin to homescreen and open in fullscreen mode on ipad rather than open in safari.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Adam Steed,Pretty good and stable. Works 90% of the time. But can sometimes be slow to open and gif comments won't show sometimes.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,love it does what it's supposed to. faster than stock with less problems on Galaxy S8. using multiple devices requires paid option.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Honestly it has been incredibly useful, I get kind of envious of apple users able to connect their iPhones and Macs but now I can do that with my PC and Note 9 it's very useful. 9/10 would buy again",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Richard,Great interface and syncs across devices instantly. Like how I can customize tones for different notifications. Great job!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Uche Okoronkwo,"I'm just giving 5* because of the fastness of the App. However, the App is due for an update, to meet the challenges of the upgrades in Androids",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app. was having trouble with my old messaging app on my new phone. It wouldn't send group messages. This one solved it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ewa Bialkowski,Excellent app. Great customer support. The only thing missing is a like button just to acknowledge that text message has been received.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Richard Cassidy,"I have lost soooooooo many text messages due to errors. The messages just didn't get backed up, and all this AFTER I purchased a lifetime pass. The money spent was useless since Pulse did not backup messages. So mad, I want my $11 back",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a great message app, I especially like the customisation features which can be for all or per individual and the repeat notification option which my phone's preloaded message app did not have.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I installed this app because it was the best app I could find to pair my Galaxy Watch with my Android phone. I've only had it running for a couple of weeks, but install and functionality seem to be just what I needed. Happy user here.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,V. L.,"Gets super laggy if you have lots of messages, can't find a work around and have reported it many times with no feedback from the vendor. I have the paid version. Update: App still hangs after reinstall and even cleanup of old messages. No feedback from vendor happy to help.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,By far best text messaging app I've encountered. Has many privacy features. And subscription is a plus. Worth the download and try. Better than most apps I've tested.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chelsea Travis,The emojis are organized randomly and less intuitively. That's my only complaint. All other features are great.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Threaded view of sms exchanges is the best. Lightweight, fast, and the ability to send just text disabling MMS makes it the killer app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Leija,Best texting app that is completely free. Doesn't bother you with ads. I've tried at least a dozen different apps and this is by far the best one.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"yeah,i already saw the plenty of two watch photos that look like every other texting app, on your site and in the play store, they didnt really show anything. the app does NOT work on the watch. it's just white and says no conversations, even tho I was using it on my phone and made an acct. but sorry, I would love help, because like I said this is the only sms watch app that's not messages, and I would gladly buy the lifetime subscription if I could get it to work",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shiloh Lane,"I like this app, I think that it's a good app to text on. I can really complain much about it, but my only suggestion is to let people change the font cause that would make it more nicer, but other than that it's great.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Russ Pollock,Works Well. By far the best messaging app for all platforms that I've come across yet. UPDATE: I have now been using PULSE for almost an entire year now and am still very happy with it's performance across platforms.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryan Conklin,"The app was recently acquired by Maple Media without notice from the developer. I can no longer trust using this app when another open source project ""Nano Defender"" was caught just last week collecting personal data after being acquired by another company. If the dev would have made an announcement before it was purchased and whether they would still be maintaining the app then I might have kept using it. Unless someone trustworthy starts checking the code every update I won't be coming back.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe Smith,"I couldn't live without it 😎 Update June 2021: The app has become unreliable. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. I've ditched Pulse for Microsoft Your Phone.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Hands down the best sms app EVER! Very customizable and has great features such as send delay. It's a better version of Android Messages.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Slow to tables and PC. Works well on the phone but very slow to update to table and PC. Some text updates can be hours before a message is posted to android table or PC device.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cody Holt,"Removed a star because the app got more expensive for really no extra benefit to the people who use it. The original creator sold this to maple media and they increased the prices quite a bit. Still a great app, but cannot in good conscious keep the 5th star.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Phil Hawn,Sometimes it's too easy to accidentally swipe a good conversation to Archive when you're just tapping on it. Frustrating when it happens and you have to go to Archive to retrieve and put it back.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,World Balance,Doesn't send photos to iPhone. Sometimes doesn't send or receive text messages and there is no way to tell. Friends call my cell after a few days because they never received the txts that I send them.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,i like being able to send txt from computer or link to a phone for continuity but trying to get it to work on the watch is impossible because you have enternthe password. Has anyone there tried typing on a watch? it is practically impossible.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jamie Kriger,app has been consistently shutting down over the past week.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Anthony Downton,Good app. Sending multiple photos seem to be a challenge. If you can make it where I can password protect the app.... that would be great!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Hunt4Perch,Somewhat convoluted when trying to install on another Android device. It needs to be the default SMS App and so does the messenger on your device.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Tariq Saeed,I have requested to add year in message timestamp as it is very difficult to locate messages. I have messages history for about 3 years and it is impossible ro ascertain the year of a particular message. Please implement,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,CJ Reynolds,No option from drop down to move messages in and out of private. You have to go to setting of each message to do it. Too time consuming,2

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I installed the app as I was unable to send photos with texts on my huawei. It solved that problem but so many of my short texts failed to send, arrived broken up or sent 4 times I have uninstalled.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It just doesn't work properly when i need ut to-keep having to revert to using Google and messages for Web. Sick if it. Constantly tells me it's sending. Not sent loads to my mum and it's been important,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The latest update caused my app, both on phone and laptop to malfunction. Trying to get any sort of refund is pointless with all the hoops. Was good while it lasted.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is app gives you as close an imessage experience as you can get. Web, phone, tablet, smart phone access and syncing it great.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,In call logs..the Sim card number for dual SIM phones.. is so small that I have to search my glasses just for it. Very inconvenient. Also messages are not asked which Sim and sent from default number unless you press the small icon on left by the message type coloum. Sad. Someone fix it. Plz.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It Just Works! I switch phones a bit, plus have a tablet and laptop. Pulse lets me text from all and syncs perfectly!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Was looking for a fix to correct problem with other apps cropping photos. Tried Pulse. Problem solved. Thanks. Love it so far.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like this app a lot, except that there's some problem with the text flickering while I'm typing. I updated the app, and the problem didn't go away.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alex,Amazing app. I've been using it on my Mac and Windows to send texts from my computer. It's been working for years and getting the life time subscription was totally worth the cost.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,So far so good. Extremely fast app. Does not convert long SMS messages to MMS. Able to schedule texts in advance. Neat format and design,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Tried the 'import everything' apk and it only imported 10k messages for a conversation with more than 11k messages. The 'View History' feature imported more but not all.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,5 star app. A complete sms app. Ad free You should have option to detect otp and allow copying it to clipboard. True caller sms has that feature. So otp messages only otp is shown in notification and there is a button to copy it. Pulse should get it asap,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,rm23 m,"I like the app overall, but very often I get messages hours later. Why is this happening FREQUENTLY!? ALSO There is no feature to 'like' another's message similar to iphone.",3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"eveytime i receive a message, it uses the ""other notification tone"", not the message alert tone. .its kinda annoying coz all my notifications sounds the same, how can i change it?",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This is the perfect sms app. The message scheduling and web interface alone outshine the competition. Hoping the app eventually works with RCS.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Peter Morgan,"I have it a fantastic rating. Now I am worn out. It demands I rate it again and again, and locks up the app until I do it. So, I will keep re rating it in order to keep using it, until I wear out, and try something else. So sad, I really liked it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Just want I was looking for.  I've tried Texta, Google Messages, Stock App, and Chomp SMS, but none meet my needs like Pulse SMS.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've used a bunch of messaging apps and none come close to Pulse. The feature set is unmatched. Thank you for giving us the best messaging app there is in my opinion,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pretty good app..sort of bland and themes won't let the app interface look any different but I like that I can text from my wifi galaxy tablet from my phone number/text messages. Shine it up a little bit more and I'll give 5 stars,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dennis Poupart,Works great!! I use it with my metro lg and my Samsung tablet. No problems at all. Messages seem to arrive nearly simultaneously.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Latest update killed the app. When you open it it just closes. Unusable. Edit : Uninstalling and re-installing fixed the problem.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,eddie M,Stop shower *write a review* everytime I open it,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This used to be my favorite sms app. Since the update though It asks for permission to be the default sms app every single time i send a text. Its become an annoyance so i went back to stock Android.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Scott lange,This is a great app! I use a Samsung Galaxy 8+ and their software is really bad for group texting. This one nails it! It's my primary messaging app now. Thank you!!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,00gr1ngo,"Best features include being able to text from any web browser as well as repeating scheduled messages. My P.O. receives the same text every morning at 7AM, ""Any drug/alcohol tests today?"" This way I meet his requirements, and get to sleep in at the same time",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Like to be able to lock a message to keep from deleting it. Also when you have a chat open , it would be good to get the notification to go off as well. Thanks",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Andy Billups,"App is excellent, just don't like the lifetime cost of the app being so expensive if you want it to work on your watch. That's the only downside.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gerald Schilling,"works Great, easy to customize",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Devon Manska,"100$ lifetime fee is available. Seems steep but will update again after giving it a try. Being military, the option to text from computers and tablets seems to be great.",3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love this app! A conversation that is accidentally deleted by swiping, and it's too late to be undone should be placed in a trash bin so that it is retrievable.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Chancho Villa,Still works great on PC and Android systems as well as Chrome and Firefox browser plug-ins. The lifetime license is 100% worth it.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Philip Hopper,"To go honest I've never thought to leave a review for this app because I've loved it, it's never given me an issue and I've never said or thought anything bad towards it. Been using it now for over 2 years and probably going to be more years to come. 👍",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,April Cleaver,Works well. I really like that it allows me to sync my messages with my galaxy watch 3 and pixel 4a. I bought the lifetime subscription. Worth it!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Wade Campbell,"Pulse is Everything messages is not. I love this app. Customizable, compact, beautiful and bold. So many ways to make it truly your own.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Needs little better voice to text conversion and auto correct spelling works but several of error.......should get better. Way better than what the S9+ default app,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alan Reynolds,"Awesome being able to get your messages on multiple apps, would be especially cool if it was especially designed for the Samsung smartwatch.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a great texting app, except it doesn't respect my Do Not Disturb. Last night I s awakened twice by notifications from the post office about a package I'm tracking. Uninstalled!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Really clean, light, and functional. The customization really pulls together the looks and feel of how I I like my phone to be, great job.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mitchell Donovan (KC2MAT),"I like it, although I have some issues with taking pictures through the app. It's a lot more smooth taking the picture and then adding it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I'm enjoying the app! My one recommendation would be to display contact photos for group messages. I dont like how pictures dont show for group chats in the conversation list.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Laren Droll,It just works. A satisfying app. I wish it would allow me to mark all texts as read without visiting everyone of them. That's the only annoying thing.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Meira Schonbrun,"I love the schedule message feature, and the pin up. On my old system, I was able to select that something repeat d itself mre than once on a given day. Is it possible to change it to do that as well?",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,dolobran,The app does a good job and multi-device/platform is very convenient. Laptop app can hang and occasionally needs to be refreshed manually.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Susie Richetti,"I love this messaging app! I can pin conversations to the top of message list, I can send group messages- and replies ONLY come to me, no glitches in 4 years- just great performance!",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like the simple platform with the color coded contacts. It's works just like it should. Don't change anything!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Xenomorphicme (Xenomorphicme),"I like it a lot for being used cross platform, and the customization. I would like it to filter more of the random messages. But I like it a lot",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,When I originally got it it was fantastic then I started missing messages and then I didn't like that I had to make a it I paid for a subscription to different occasions and I'm still logged out after we log back in I paid twice I did like it but it's awful and I don't suggest that you get it,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Yasmin Plüss,"This app is great. I mostly use it to send sms when im at my computer, but you can also use this app to still receive text messages when traveling via Internet.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,George McMaster,"Good app.. using as main although my phone is dual SIM and unfortunately although in settings you can request which sim to use, pulse app does not offer a choice and I have to go to settings if messaging from the other sim.- that is why 4 not 5 stars",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rob Robinson,Recently the app has started failing to send messages. That's a problem. I have to switch apps until it gets fixed,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dv8,I love being able to text from the pc and scheduled messages. I bought the lifetime subscription a couple years ago and it's still my favorite texting app,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Would be good if I could send and receive mms properly. MMS is a confusing mess and hardly ever sends or turns them into group chats. I've uninstalled.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,galaxy s7 edge. i used this app for a long time convinced my phone could not send / receive pix. i almost smashed my phone in anger. i found it was this app. THIS APP CAN'T SEND / RECEIVE PIX. what the hell good is it?,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan Genders,Best app for easy blocking off messages by key word. Only issue is it does not put picture messages in the conversation.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"overall, I like this app. I would like to see a few simple features added to it that would make it a little more functional. But, compared to other apps that I've used, I like this one the best.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"very better than default nessage app on android. beautiful appearance, different setting for each conversation, schedule message sending, night mode, ....",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kevin Nielsen,"Found this a couple years ago and have been using it as my default messaging app ever since! It's reliable, it has a few cool features, but most of all, it just works. 😎",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gary Pohl,"Does everything it needs to, a few things extra, and is reliable, and easy to use. No annoying ads.... Good app",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"finally, an app that keeps an eternal record of text messages. so happy with this. I would have given 5 stars if the UI was a bit better.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love this text app! You can pin your frequents to stay on top, you can search a conversation using keywords, and there are fun colors to choose from for your text bubbles.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This is a really good messaging app with a lot of customizability. I also really enjoy the ability to schedule messages 😁,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Pete,Just plain awful. Couldn't get any kind of syncing to work at all. Not worth your time and or money. Mighty text for the win.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"When I'm in a multiple person conversation, I don't get text messages from the people. One on one conversations work right. Fix that and I will rate Pulse with 4stars.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stephen Knapp,"A very nice, no ad, presentation. Easy to use, unobtrusive, with useful settings. Recommended.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really loved Samsung's messaging app but moved to a Pixel and wanted something better for me than Google messaging. Pulse fits the bill for me. I like it and will keep using it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Deneen Deaver,"Very good experience. Would like the ability to 'Lock' texts, but other than that I am very pleased with the Pulse app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aaron Livingston,"Great interface, plus scheduled messaging and private chat with password. Terrible video and camera function. Too much compression even at max.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lisa Knieser,"Love the features and security, but cannot send videos. May just be my phone, but I could send them with other messaging apps.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kriss Pickering,"Great little SMS app that does excactly what it says it does. Only thing that would make it better is if you could also use it for other messaging services to like Messanger and WhatsApp, but thats just wishful thinking...",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Fantastic and smooth with nice colour themes. only improvement would be for a search feature within messages and then we're talking 5 stars.....,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Limited options for sharing texts with pictures. Can only share one picture at a time, not a group of pictures.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Not all the SMS show up for a conversation. I am not using RCS and not even MMS. There are 4000+ SMS in a conversation, Pulse only shows last 500. I've even downloaded and tried other SMS apps, they all showed all of the SMS in the conversation.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Like the app but it has issues with longer messages in that one cannot see what is being typed. Don't have this issue with other messaging apps,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Fantastic app. Google's messages was glitching all the time. Shut it down and use Pulse for last 5 months. I use pulse browser plug-in to text from my desk.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Junkoku Uchiji,"That's nice, press longer on ""send"" to program a timer on your message. Also, that's great. I mean, that's pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Replaced Samsung texting with this app because I could not send pictures using Samsung messaging. No problems with pulse. Love the app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cameron Robson,This app has really worked for me. I wanted to be able to set up standard messages as templates to use again and again. This app delivers.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Awesome app. The only one I could find that allows me to text from my computer without a weekly subscription.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Zoran Cuturilo,"Very simple and effective app without add. Private folder is protected, but visible as a folder to everybody.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Debra Wright,I dislike the app. It pushes all your messages together which makes it hard to distinguish the new ones from the old ones and who they are from.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This was a great replacement for the message app that came with my phone. It was failing bad, and Pulse SMS saved me for sure. I love it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It's okay. It falls extremely short when it comes to customization which is what I care about most. The rest of the app functions well.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,i use this for uber and wifi hotspot between devices. i can text from all 3 devices and it lets me send and recieve .gif files which are so much fun. pay for the 1 time fee its worth it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"No where do you find out about the fees. I guess they get you hooked then tell you how much. If I hadn't looked at the multiplatform info, I'd be running blind. Yes, it is a great program, but why pay for what you can get for free?! Silly.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Much better than Samsung's stock app. Like how messages are separated by date and pinned convos. Letting us choose theme is also a huge plus. Thanks so much keep up the good work,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,G S,"Good texting app. Used it to replace android messages and still able to archive with a swipe, so easy transition.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian Fanning,Pulse SMS gives you the ability to schedule texts in the future. Otherwise no better than the phone's native SMS app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aaron Buckley,Super easy to install and use. I really like the clean interface on desktop and mobile. Well done Pulse!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very annoying and intrusive ad to upgrade to plus version. If it wasn't for this one thing, I would consider it a good app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The best SMS app. The best way to text from your computer. Beautiful, intuitive interface. Perfect.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"love this app! Let me tell you I've used too many text apps, and this is the only one I've found that will go across multiple devices and your computer that doesn't completely stick ass",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Marilyn Clark,Love the app. I was able to use it to access my texts on all my devices. The only thing it lacks is the ability to copy parts of a text.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love pulse! It's free and it has so many options that I love. I can have secret messages which comes in handy for Christmas. I can pin a conversation to the top. It's been very helpful!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kat Masterson,"This app offered a week to check it out. I checked the one week, and ***BAM!*** I AM ASKED TO PAY UP?FREE OFFER? I THINK THIS IS Stressful. I don't want any apology. You said thanks for the info? A week ago. 3-29-21 found reply. I will leave if you confirm I do not have to cancel ANY 'pay to play.' Thank you for answering. I never saw your symbol to read any received messages, or control of phone, or use of phone in emergency.Plus Texts. Some Unidentified app asks for defaud control.Am unwell",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is not a free app. How can a justification of a subscription fee coincide with a description of a"" free always will be"" statement. If the functions of the application need purchasing, that is not free.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Gallegos,This app has worked really well for me. The text app originally on my phone for some reason stopped working. Decided to use Pulse to replace my old text app. No complaints here.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This beats the socks off other text apps I've tried. Tons of options, user friendly, and attractive.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Hands-down best SMS app I've ever used. Outstanding integration with desktop pc for texting without getting my phone out. Love it!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Temitope Selowo,"Great app! Would have rated it a 5, it for the scheduled SMS. Doesn't send at scheduled time. Sends only when app is opened. Overall, great app",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love this app but for some reason every once in a while I cannot send or recieve text with pics. I have to convert back to my default app to send a pic. Any resolution to this?,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rick Olson,"Mostly good. Occasional issues with Chrome. Eg if you change tabs in the middle of writing, your text vanishes",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Woodward,"App don't even work. I go to send a text and it don't even try to send.do not download. Reviews are fake. I have deleted. If this is your first introduction to your app,I wnat no part of it.keep it.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Issam Riziq,"I like it, it makes deleting easier, scheduling is perfect and there are other options that i didn't use, but i appreciate.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Terrance,"Great app, easy to use and customizable, application is available for just about every platform including Windows, Mac, Linux and a web app which doesn't care what platform you run!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The 9nly reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I would love to see an option for a background as well as a transparency effect. Other than that, this app has been great for me.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I'm not able to receive or send group messages at all. Is this a limitation of the app or do I have to do something to enable it? I really like the app so far but if it can't do group chats I will have to use something else,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Does what it does and going premium let's you text from desktop and backup messages when you switch to a new phone. No iOS support though.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,M Pe,The best app so far for getting email that I have found. It does not have many interruption pauses for the user. I highly recommend and why I gave it 5 stars to this date. 9/23/21.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app works reasonably well and allows access to text messages on tablets and other devices. it also had some nice features such as scheduled text messages.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Fitt,"UPDATE: It's been a couple years and I still love it! Solid, well-designed app. More than happy to pay for the lifetime subscription. Totally worth it. And nice to support a real person, instead of a faceless corporation.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,😃 Pluse is the best messaging App its way better then any Messaging App that any of the phones ive had has had yet. I give $3-$5 for Pulse SMS Phone/Tablet/Web As long as you have an account for Pulse you can download the App on your tablet or phone so you can check Your REAL PHONE NUMBER Text messages 👌,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Darrin Moir,"I like the web based access, but for a paid messaging app, I just expected a little less glitches when trying to send pictures.",3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Simple, straightforward, effective. Occasional settings challenges, but extensive help section.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I run a business and have a lot customers to deal with. This is THE best solution to dealing with the curious few who wants questions answered. The best part is that everything can be completely automated!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like it. It does everything I need. It's just a little slower than most apps at sending group & picture text.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rachel Caballero,"If I send a group message, sometimes the message is not sent to everybody (i.e. not everyone receives it.) I love the app otherwise, just wish I could rely on it for group messaging.",3

xyz.klinker.messenger,Sophia Zaragoza,"Quick and easy to use ,it's simple. Reliable and stocked with alot of resourceful gadgets.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like everything about the app except for group chats. No ability to allow direct responses versus group responses. Otherwise it would get a 4 or 5 star but that is a big bummer,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alex Schnell,The latest update (June 14th) broke the app. It won't open anymore and MMS messaging still doesn't work properly.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kendra Anderson,I love this app. But sometimes it opens slow and will change notification tones for some phone numbers. But I still love it.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Chaz,"I use Textra but thought I'd give this a shot because I just got a samsung active 2 watch. After trying the trial and logging into it on my watch, its horrible. Typing on it gave me so much anxiety I wanted to rip my watch off.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This app did not work as i needed and i deleted immediately. That's not the problem. The problem is i contacted the developer for a refund and NEVER EVEN GOT A RESPONSE! I want my 10.99 back. So unprofessional.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Why God why would you not allow more fine tuning for the delay to send message?? This is a personal feel why would you jump from one second to three? I need two seconds. Is this so hard to include?? Omg,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I just purchase this app for monthly subscription and getting failed login on web and other mobile device. What's the issue. If there isn't any solution please give back my money. Thanks!,2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Carey Roberts,"LOVE scheduling messages! As a night owl, I can't tell you how valuable it's been for me to be able to type a message at 1am that won't send until a more respectable time or follow up with someone on a convo... see how they're doing without worrying that I'll forget. This way people feel they're on my mind more regularly for personal matters and I won't cross any boundaries for business texts! Awesome functionality!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Probably a bug - The sender of an incomplete/draft message still stays on top after incomplete message is deleted by successive presses of the backspace key.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Tomczak,"Excellent. I deal with a lot of staff, so the paid version has been awesome for texting them from my computer.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,One annoying thing is that when I have a new message. The notification still shows previously seen messages already.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app! Feedback: Please allow to multi-select conversations and mark them as Read. Currently, the only option with multi-select is to delete, archive, or mark as UNread.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,JJ,Great lay out but constantly gets stuck sending and if you send multiple messages in short succession it often sends them out of order.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrés G,Have had this app for a few years. It has been pretty good to me. Wish there was a refresh on the look but I can't complain too much never have had issues.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app! I got it because my native text app did not do scheduling and I have come to rely on it. Pulse does that and everything else a message app should! And it's pretty.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I really love it so much...just an update of it should include the option that you can rename the private box. No need to hide texts when anyone can just ask for the password abd you know you cant dwny.. Other wise am in Love with it😍😍😍,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great SMS app. I like the modern UI, customization and block features. Easy to set up and use.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Works well. No complaints. Haven't experimented with the pc text yet,will update when I can.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jason Mejia,Works great on my phone... the only problem i have is that theres not a app for ios and the web on the iPad doesn't work very well.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse allows me to send/receive text messages with whatever device I have in my hand. It does exactly what it promises in a very elegant manner no matter which device I am using. Well done!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Toye Johnson,"Worked one time, that's before you have to pay and sign up for an account, then after that I received no text from anyone not on my watch or my phone after paying for the lifetime plan of $11.00.... still waiting for response from devs",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I've really liked this app until it wouldn't send a video message. Had to go back to my default app just to get the video to send.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,MedDev Dude,Great alternative to Google messenger with more features. Seems to work fine with Republic Wireless despite initial message from RW saying it was incompatible,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love pulse! Loaded with lots of features 🌝 super easy-to-use, and you do it all with no ads! Awesome app. Thanks to you ✌️",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jason Pontius,"Love the mobile and desktop app so I can text from my pc. However, it is buggy and often doesn't sync.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Its an ok app. Downloaded it because my gear text notifications quit working and will only work on this app. Would be nice if an android app would sync with i message.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cameron Lamaster,"Very straightforward experience. I like that you can schedule messages, because other times, I'll be at work and not as able to send a text as I would be at other times in my day.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,surely worth to pay for its capabilities and options plus quick synchronization with the desktop app. great work developers!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jon Isom,So far so good. I switched from Textra because it started to have a negative effect on my network connection. 10/29/20 — installed on my new phone and still 5 stars!!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark McLendon,This is the worst texting app I've ever used. It's crashes everyday. It's very difficult to add pics. Don't use unless you have to do so.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Junaid Aziz,"Good. If you also add Weekdays in Schedule SMS, that would be great. Meaning it should be like , Daily / Weekdays / Weekly/ Monthly etc...",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Really good overall, however when I receive an MMS it comes as a group text with my own number in a new thread. Very frustrating.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ida Alonge,This is an awesome app so far. My friend suggested it when I was lamenting that my new phone didn't allow me to schedule texts. It even gives me suggestions on how to respond.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Joshua Krautz,"Great app, features are plentiful. If you ever want a different flavour than the default messaging app give Pulse a shot.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Good app, I believe there are more things to be added, like a widget that let's you know how many messages you've not read or replied. 5 star when I see captivating features",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"MMS messages still not going through. Thought I'd give it some time to get worked out, but after seeing that others are having the same issues, I've given up. Everything else in the app works as it should",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I really liked this app but for some reason im not getting all my messages. I was in a group msg with my daughters and alot of their msgs didnt come thru at all! And tonight it happened again with another contact. Guess ill have to search for another msg app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very nice and easy to operate. I installed it and solved my problem of receiving sms by delay of 8 to 10 minutes, on built in contact manager sms app of my lenovo vibe K5 smart phone, by switching over to pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sherry Markwart,I have used Pulse for a few years. I love that I can send text msgs from my Mac Desktop and my Android phone. But lately my messages are not getting through to iPhone users. 😥,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Leonard Singbiel,"Great concept, but can get slow and buggy on conversations that have a lot of texts.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app! Unfortunately, the app is unable to open my big group chat. Wondering how this can be fixed. Edit: Yes I lowered the max image size.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Works really well and has minimal lag between devices. You have to have a data connection either way,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ann Graper Nance,"Easy to use and customize. Have only had it a few days, but have not experienced the bugs we had with Google messenger and VZ messenger. So far, so good!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Clearly the best beyond the best message app, so I suggest you ditch the standard message app that comes with your phone and download the PULSE App. if they charged to use it I'd pay for it on a heart beat.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brian Cockerell,Went it very smoothly. Currently trialling multi device option. Using text search to blacklist a scammer. Great product.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,ive only been using it for a short time but everything seems to run seamless between my tablet and phone. Very user friendly!!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have tried many sms apps, but this one is my best choice, since it has simple balanced design and features that are missed in many other apps.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This has it all! You can customize chats, text on your computer, and schedule messages just to name a few. My only complaint is I wish I would have found this sooner.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Douglas Abernathy,Clean app with no issues. I use it because it allows me to schedule text messages for later.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Douglas Doud,"Phenomenal features. Love the auto response and scheduling capabilities, especially for my dedicated work phone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love the app but I'm having 1 issue and 1 request. When my wife sends me MMS, it appears in another thread and not on our SMS thread. My request is to have a pic from my gallery as my background. Thank you, Galaxy s10 +",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rana Haseeb ayaz,"It's good, except for the part where typing is slow. Each letter I press has like bit delay animation",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Tijerina III,I like that I can schedule messages to be sent out. That makes it so I don't have to remember to message somebody later when they are awake. I schedule the message to send at normal hours people are awake and forget about it. It is also nice when you tell someone you will message on Friday evening and can schedule it ahead of time to send.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,SendLudeS,I do really like this app unlike the more plain like app my phone's come with . But why doesn't it notify me of the text messages? Is it something in permissions or in the app settings? Thank you,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Easy to send and receive messages on my phone, desktop and laptop. Very few bugs and a clean UI.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aleister Crowley,"It's okay at best. Past messages often times don't show up right. It may take hours for messages to go through. Other than that, it seems okay.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joshua Carter,Works great! I love having the web interface so I can still text when away from my phone or when my phone is dying. Even a cheapskate like me found this app worth contributing too financially.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Swey Vish,Awesome. Just wish they would upgrade to have automatic texts sent between a certain timeframe/dates.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"very good app, great pricing plans, and you never need to worry about losing your text messages because they are in the cloud",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stephen Jones,A while back Google removed the really useful features of Androids stock message app. Including scheduling messages and selecting colours for people you are messaging. Pulse has these features.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Notifications do not work, trouble shooting did not fix the problem, no refund for lifelong plan received. Be very careful if you intend to pay for this app, so that you do not pay for a not functioning app.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,absolute rubbish. cannot send MMS group texts or even group texts with no images. sat there wondering why no one had messaged me back only to discover that no one has received them. uninstalling.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,installed it on a second phone. Not super fancy but very useful messaging app. It keeps me organized and much better than the stock app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Tarver,"Easy, intuitive. I like the ""scheduling"" feature a lot. Solid - never glitches.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Like this app a lot, plan to use it to replace Verizon Messages. But this would be 5 stars if you added indicators ""sent"", ""delivered"", "".... is typing""",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,BECKA COX,Started using Pulse a few years ago. I tried ALOT of other messaging apps before this and hated them all. I highly recommend trying Pulse. It has cool and practical abilities without being too extra.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"i needed the folders option, which it has, but i couldn't find message alert personalization feature for contacts, which is a turndown for me",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I used this app because it kept the texting widget when the original sms app took it away, but i noticed i often times wouldnt recieve group texts and would only find out days later when one of my friends asked if i saw ""the message""",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Would be nice if the pop-up option is available in case I'm using another app. It not a big deal but it would be nice to not got to the notifications just to reply to a text... 3 stars,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Irvin PT,Its a great app for syncing SMS. It does everything as advertised. Great deal for the onetime payment.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Amerie,"Wanted an app that let me choose different notification sounds for different senders, and this does it well. It just works",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patricia O'Neil,"Great texting app. I've been using it for several years. I like being able to text from any device, even my old pc",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeff Caffery,It just works better then the app that came with my Galaxy phone. I can schedule messages to be sent at a later time as well which I often use. Is it perfect? What is?,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Thomas Frase,way better than the default messaging app. It allows for scheduled messages and makes group messages as easy to read through as Facebook messenger.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,outstanding app that I'm using on a BYOD device with Verizon that was having trouble with mms using Android messages. Pulse works without a problem and I enjoy using the web texting feature for the paid variant,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Seeing all the reviews it seems like a great idea to use this app; the only reason I'm downloading is to get a received notification since my phone is not providing. So does it notify when it's received to the person I have sent the sms?,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Combines basic text handling with delayed / scheduled texting. Very useful. Stable and bug free thus far,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love it!! I just wish you could give us the options for custom vibrations! That's the ONLY thing keeping this app from perfect in my opinion! Thank you!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Karen Leger,I removed a couple stars due to the fact that I am constantly receiving duplicate photos. Photos that were sent to me days or even weeks ago will come through again.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've been having a hard time selecting between Go Sms pro Textra SMS, handcent sms and this with my main factors being dual SIM support, private box and efficient app. This one met all",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Excellent tie in with Windows 10 desktop app. Also very clear design all round. I now use it all the time 👍,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse is the best messaging app I have ever used. I upgraded to the lifetime level long before the trial was over.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Alicia Harvey,You are supposed to be able to put customize your contacts notifications sounds. I could before but now it doesn't work.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Excellent. Well worth paying for. Four stars as the browser sync is a bit hit and miss.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This is the only free sms app with features to hide private messages. go sms is too pricey. mood sms has too much bugs also not free. So I would probably recommend pulse having private message and its free,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Peter Albar,I feel that this is better than the Verizon Wireless app for text messaging and I really don't remember why and also this is the only app I tried so I don't know if others may be better(?).,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I wish I could get rid of the ""today,"" ""this week,"" ""this month,"" and ""older"" but otherwise this is a very nicr texting app.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Simon Susina,"Excellent app, very simple to select from which SIM you would like to send an SMS in case you have two SIM cards in your phone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like the setup of it but there was alot of messages I didn't receive...... Sorry get notified of receiving. And tbh I felt like it was taking longer to send mms than with the normal messaging app,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,George McCusker,Took out full subscription with the thought I could get a refund if not satisfied. I installed on a tablet only to learn Pulse is for phones. Tried to get my refund but no luck.,2

xyz.klinker.messenger,David Sugarman,Fantastic been using it for years. Paid version is worth is and developer is easy to communicate with.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Wonderful app. it allows me to send group messages as individual messages. this prevents the annoying process of everyone getting answers from everyone else in a group.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeana Heriman,Suddenly group message responses are sent to each individual causing them to think I only wrote them then they resend to the group. I wrote for tech help a week ago and no response from Maple. Disappointed.,1

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,At first I loved this app it worked perfect then I paid to become a lifetime member of it so I could always have my messages backed up and now it wont work and keeps failing to send messsages,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,Thad Fiebich,Great app! I enjoy scheduling future messages. Has a great image editing feature when sending pictures messages,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Fairest,Poor design when I am either trying to paste something or add attachments in a reply the + button for new message comes up by default and sits right on top of what I'm trying to do,3

Or if i send 5 or more than five message to my friend same problem accur this app is not working properly..,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,J. Lamar H.,The concept is good but unfortunately it's not true to what it said it can do. Unlike Google Voice wear with Google Voice no matter if I'm on a computer on my tablet or on the phone it's always there my messages are always backed up and always there. On this application it is not like that my tablet my computer in my phone a Neversink up and if my phone is off I cannot communicate just on my tablet alone I cannot send text through the website alone my phone always have to be on that's not a good,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Left the free Google Messages for Web and paid for this. One of the top 8 decisions I've made. Does not shed connection between my phone and my computers.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Was fine until last update. Now messages all fail. Don't want to drop pulse but need reliable text service.,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I downloaded this just to post a review and call out the developer. The responses to the reviews are absolutely horrendous and unprofessional! Never have I seen a developer never apologize or never take responsibility for their faults, let alone insult the users who are having difficulties with the app. I've sent multiple emails with screenshots to Google with the intention of having Pulse taken down. You don't deserve to be on the Play Store. This is coming from a developer btw.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jed Firestone,Fantastic app! Way better than the stock Samsung messages and any other third party app. PC/Mac platform is so nice to have. It's like iMessages without Apple.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kyle Jenkins,Flawless experience. Love the theming and the minimalist approach to a messaging app. Great job!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I began to use Pulse as I'd heard it supported message templates - I haven't in fact used (or found) this function yet but in all other respects Pulse is really nice to use and looks good too.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Essential for me as I live by the PC not the phone. I wish the PC app would alert when texts arrive.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love being able to switch platforms instantly. And the customization available is awesome.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mack Ilagan,Been using this app for quite some time now. Never encountered any problems. And the no ads is terrific. Would recommend this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Zack D.,"Works great on my phone, tablet, and PC; though on PC it sometimes has issues sending images.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"great app. wonderful maintenance & cross platform. sweet as price. can you make a setting to disable spell check? real clunky for me. have to delete the whole word if i make a mistake, blocks me from inserting the cursor.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Now that Tizen support is here im even happier with this. Works quite well. I suggest paying for all features as its more than worth the cost. I still cant get the hippocracy of Apple rejecting the app either. Constructive criticism for you: responding negatively to lower ratings is not helping your image. Offer helpful insight or request negative rating users contact you directly. Thats all you need to respond. Also thank the positive reviewers.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Roland Lowe,The PC version is a bit wonky. And the two need to sync up better. It still gets the job done.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,fatimah hijabb,It's a nice app. But need more work. Some themes will be auwsome. Also it does not have a wake screen option or badge icon for unread msgs. You should consider adding that.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,A great app to view messages from Google voice and network number at the same place! Love the interface of the app also.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It's good but sometimes it doesn't send the first messages whenever the another receptor cell was switched on. It must work better than it was...,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,David Kendrick,Love the clarity and the flip of a finger to send a file to save. Very helpful.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"perfect, beautiful and without a doubt the best messaging app i have ever used and probably ever will. you can't possibly ask for more!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"it was ok but randomly messages and whole conversations get deleted. yes i have ""delete old messages"" turned OFF. and conversations still disappear. it's inconvenient.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,lenora reid,I couldn't receive mms messages until I used this sometimes I get messages that were sent from someone other than who it says but now I can get mms as the previous one installed wouldn't I can live with the very occasional mishaps,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Most of the features other similar apps have discontinued. A great tool for a great price.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,C Galvas,"I prefer this over my default messenger. I was tired of missing texts, so originally got this so it would repeatedly go off to tell me when I had a text.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,BPF,Works great with Galaxy Watch and will be even better with the addition of extra options! Giving 5 stars because of the customer service! Very responsive!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really good texting app!!!Im usually always on my computer so being able to push notifications while im on there and being able to respond ln it and then continue the conversation on my phone is awesome 5/5 from me,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Excellent app and doesn't drain my battery. Extension works like you want it to. Intuitive,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,App crashes every time you try to send a message. Unfortunate because I was looking forward to give this one a try but it doesn't work.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Wells,Been using this app and the others for a few years now and love the seamless sync across devices. Definitely recommend.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Julio Mo,"I love that it doesn't have ads, and you can schedule a message. Not like the Google messaging app. Good job guys!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,V S,Wayyyy better than the native text app. The schedule texts feature is sooo helpful! I have encountered no issues so far,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Ultimately one of the best SMS apps you have here. Advancing user interface and great cross-platform compatibility are the two most redeeming qualities of this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"perfect cross platform experience. I have it on my laptop, PC, phones and tablet. seamless sync and communication",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,jackie stagg,Very simple clear and responsive. Better than stock Google. Been using pulse for awhile. Went back to google but hated it! Pulse is still the best.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Android messenger was crashing and would take up to a minute to send texts. This one works! 5 stars,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dan Reynolds,"A few glitches here and there, but the texting from PC is well worth it. I got the lifetime membership and it's paid for itself in just a few days.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Today i used this app for the first time and this app is really great in terms of features. But i will give it 5 star after getting 2 new features; first one is to add ""Mark Read/Unread"" option as Swipe option. Second is to mark starred or favourite single text message. Kindly add these two features.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nick Legge,"Just what I was looking for in a messaging app, the template options are brilliant, I don't know why other message apps don't have this option.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,One thing I would like to see is to configure different tones for special people. The Verizon app allowed it. But otherwise nice,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Diana Rodriguez,Standard. Can't find a way to block spam texts other than blacklisting the number which archives the text. It doesn't have a standard spam blocker.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have really enjoyed the app, its been the best ive tried. i have tried several for several weeks at a time and so far pulse has won my loyalty.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Thomas Leavy,Excellent and app... My stock sms having some issues... Save have tried some others... But this one is a perfect fit for me and what I'm looking for in a SMS app 😊,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Once I got both of my tablet and phone to sync it's been great. Customer service was great to considering he does most all himself.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I looked for a texting app with a private box for a long time.. this one is the best without question.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Russell Alexander,"I love being able to use this on my computer. It seems to do everything I want, just a slight learning curve after years of using another program.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Dude It's the brah!!,It's good but why don't all my contacts shoe up when I search for someone ? They're contacts who I search for who don't show up in the app but then I go into my phone's contacts and they show up in there ?,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Colin Saddington,A reasonable app. 100% better than built in phone app. Only the question of How do you lock messages so you can keep the important ones.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Yamen Al Zaim,"Need to update wear OS (watch) app, doesn't work with galaxy watch rotating bezel! Thanks for your prompt response, waiting your update to address the issue.",3

xyz.klinker.messenger,Josh Biers,Had the app for several years now. Note that the developer just got bought out so larger changes could be on their way. Minor issues here and there but otherwise good,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dave,I was having problems with my original messaging app so a friend downloaded Pulse for me. Problems solved. It's been doing everything I need without any issues.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryan Dujapa,This app sometimes is sending using my other sim even though i alteady set the sim # to use in sending sms. My mates were surprised to see me using other phone numbers. 😑😔 Because of this annoyance I revert back to my old favorite sms app which has a higher star rating compared here. 😌,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Blake Boley,Holy fu***** sh**!!!! Pulse SMS Is by far the greatest 3rd party SMS app on the the Play Store. No other app even comes close in comparison. & The absolute best aspect is that it is 110% free with NO ADS! Gracias Pulse SMS I truly love you 🥰,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Simple to use and able to retrieve and reply to messages from anywhere. Should be the Android equivalent of iMessage in my opinion.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Application is great but lacks selecting and deleting maltiple message in single conversation. And having problem with sending group message,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Linda Nichols,This messaging app works very well. I like the ability to have some contacts considered private chats in a code protected area.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Shad Cramer,Can't access groups established in contacts. This makes this app unusable to me. If owner shows me how to do this or fixes this feature I'll give it 5 stars.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,great alternative to the stock app for Samsung Galaxy S8 Active. During the last Android update the stock app lost the schedule text feature and this app made up for it.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Beta-Nex 2,I started using this app because when I got a different phone the SMS app didn't allow me to change the notification sound so I could tell if it's a text or not but this one dose and that earns 5 star rating from me,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Phil Manofsky,I like how I can schedule texts and pin convoys to the top. There are also plenty of other cool features. Good work Mr. or Ms. Pulse.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It is a okay app. However when composing message it does not see all my contacts?! Makes it rather useless for new massages, good I only use to receive bank codes.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,absolutely have loved! Allows perfect messaging app for yoyr samsung galaxy watch! you are able to view the full conversation on the watch. purchased lifetime!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Everything is great but do get the duplicate mms messages issue and cant seem to get the workaround to work. Rest is so awesome I still gave it 5 stars,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Houston James,This app is a great alternative to a non LTE smart watch. Can you add a calling feature please.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nick Damaskus,"Kinda disapointed,people have been sending pictures and iv never got wind of them once. This is a good SMS but not a good photo or video receiver",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kelsey Tolland,App does exactly what it says. Have it on my tablet and phone both sync well. Great price.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike D,"Has all the features needed, including being able to mark conversations unread and timed send.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I love this app. But my suggestion is the time when the message has been received. For example: 5mins ago And hope that you fix. I'll recommend this app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Seriously, this is the best messaging app currently available! It's clean, fast and reliable! It puts any messaging app to shame!",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Scott Wagner,Been using it for a week now. No complaints and I like being able to text from my PC. Best part is it isn't a Google product.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great overall. Use the desktop option a lot. Sync problems with missing chats occasionally. Needs improvement with individual chat vs. bulk MMS group messaging per contact.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app but when you get sms with phone number in text, that you already have in contacts, it does not show contact name, just leaves number... Chomp sms does that.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robert Miller,Pulse is extremely better then stock message app on galaxy s10 really like the customizing options and the ability to schedule texts.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Leddit Bee,"Re: free service Time used: 1 month Others tried: VZ Messages, Google Messages, Telegram Unless I'm unaware of a big security risk, or a major feature gets removed or paywalled etc, this has a thumbs up from me",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Everything is great, except the ""quick share"" doesn't work. It just makes a blank message.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,So far so good. Lifetime subscription is worth it. Great fit for my needs. Definitely recommend over other SMS messaging apps.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Better than standard SMS app. Good clear display. Configurable send delay is great.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Works well.Connects to Samsung watch. Wish it had instant resizing of text(two fingers).,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Smooth and full of customizations. Great features including accessing app on different devices.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Harold Brown,"Switch from paid extra user can't compare, this app does everything I need the $20 a year is well worth the web-based interface",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I swiched from free Textra to paid Pulse to get rid of adds because O2 started a rip off charge for any image sent including those in adds. But now I can't attach emojos using my Blackbeery Priv so the jury is out on Pulse for me.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dana D,"A lot of messages are not getting to me and some of my outgoing are never received. I'm not sure if it's TMobile, but I'm very frustrated.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,love the experiance. my only issue is that sometimes it does not update when a message comes in. To resolve this I have to back out and come back in agian.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,K Newman,Took days but eventually my subscription followed my new phone. Good app though. Update: Program still not updated to lifetime plan. Why is this so hard for you people?,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Loretta Lohman,I had the search for this because Google messages just flat quit working. I'm very pleased it's sending things faster more accurately what's not to like,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Can't live without it! One of those great productivity tools that just makes life easier. Get it and you'll see why! Really, just try Pulse out.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Shane Smith,"Had problems with Google messages lately, late /delayed texts etc, swapped to this and it's instant, like it should be. No complaints from me. Well done guys",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan Crowe,"App keeps promoting to crate an account and purchase a subscription, with no way to suppress the nag that I can find. Otherwise an excellent app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daga shannon,"because I am NOT SURE if it's You guys or someone else reading ALL of ny Texts, Sharing them to others, Or messaging as if they are me. - - Your Texting app OFFERS NO PROTECTION! So why should i Pay for something that is NOT SECURE?!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Pete M.,I like this app because of being able to tweak it the way I want it and have it connect to my car radio. There are so many great options with this app,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"its lovely. just fix one thing. whenever i am replying to a chat through quick reply (from notification) and i get another sms from the same chat, quick reply closes and have to reply from the chat which is tiring. Fix this pls.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Facepalmsareus,They charge when they say they wont. I have no idea how they got my credit card but I have tried to cancel and they still charge me every month! It's absurd.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Made the switch from Textra after using that for years. I'm really impressed with Pulse. I think I'm gonna stick with it for a while.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Paid 10bucks but can only use one number if I want to sync the messages on multiple devices. Yes developer will say its their way but it shouldn't be.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Raeed Ahmed,Absolutely love it. There is a desktop app on virtually every platform and it's the only way to do sms on my linux computer since signal doesn't do that,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Axel Ramirez,"Worked fine before with no issues, then all of a suddenly I couldn't send pictures or videos.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cody M,"Mandatory data upload? No option to not upload contacts and messages? If I don't want to use on multiple devices? Um, no.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Rocky Boi,have to say that after for some time now. SMS tone can no longer be heard on MIUI's latest roms. no matter how i tinker around it. no sms tone is coming out whenever i receive an SMS,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,What is happening to my pictures? All of a sudden I stopped getting pictures and videos. Loved this app before now but I'm forced to start looking again,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great experience! little irritating when having to reset password but great outside of that.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Scott G,Great messaging app. I purchased the full license. It's great being able to text from my laptop.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This is a great app. The web UI works extremely well. Dark mode is a blessing. Easily worth the money for the security.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Conde,It has a few minor quirks but on my OnePlus it is one of the best messaging apps i have found. And I have been through several of them.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Wynn Tourrann,"Contact names seem to be stuck. After edits to contact info, it still shows up as the original version",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app. It has replaced the default messaging app from Samsung entirely for me. It's super user friendly, AND IT DOESN'T MAKE MY GIFS FASTER THAN LIGHTNING!",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Sean Sigers,Besides the ads great app almost want to buy it but i really do think it will have any effect on the couple few popups or adds that i get its worth it for free,4

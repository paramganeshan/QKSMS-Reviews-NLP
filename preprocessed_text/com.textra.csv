com.textra,Ivan Rodriguez,"I've been using this app for about 4 years now and it freaking ROCKS! Minimal ads that don't pop up to block your screen, they are small and only appear at the top, so they're VERY easy to ignore. You can set your messages to send with up to a 9 sec delay, in case you change your mind, it automatically blocks spam text messages from both phone numbers & email addresses, has a feature where you can schedule a text to be sent at set date & time. Also you can set group replies to come to you only.",5
com.textra,Alan Mihajlov,"I can't recall hw I stumbled across Textra. All I know is once I started using it, I couldn't see any reason to look elsewhere. It had great options and customization, and just got better and better. Love the new ""Keep"" feature - - ***very smart and handy!! *** They seem to keep working on making this better and better. Since I do a lot of texting (prefer that over emailing), I would love to see their own backup program built into the app where even selecting the txts (or contact/date range) pos",5
com.textra,Traci Williams,"I just found Textra and I'm really liking this app and the features!🙂 So, here's the problem. I have it on my phone (Galaxy S22), but it's not available for my tablet (Galaxy S7 FE). It would be great if I could sync my messages to my tablet so I'm not using so many electronics at once. PLEEEASE don't make me have to search for another sms app😥. It's hard trying to find a messaging app.",3
com.textra,Brent Spiker,"definitely an improvement over the stock messaging app that came with my phone. I have been using this app for multiple years now, and continue to stick with it. It has everything I need, and it is very customizable. I used to have issues sending pictures and long texts, although that was a couple phones ago. Those issues were why I tried Textra in the first place and I just really enjoy the layout and organization. 12/1/22: still my go-to messaging app! Love the updates and features.",5
com.textra,S L,"I've been using this app for a few years now and it's really a great app. It does have ads but they can be set at the bottom of your screen (though sometimes they appear in the middle of your list of conversations) but love the customizable features, the ability to send an emoji response to messages, and their customer service is quick to answer questions. Highly recommend.",5
com.textra,Destiny Floyd,"This has been my favorite texting app for years! Past few days when I try to send a picture, after I select it, it goes into the text thread, but then quickly disappears and turns into an explanation point. Please get this fixed...I switched to the Samsung messaging app in the meanwhile, which hardly compares to Textra when it's working properly.",3
com.textra,Jessica D'Andreamatteo,"The best texting app but a bit glitchy lately. The ability to click links disappears intermittently, there is no consistent fix for this. I keep getting ""textra isn't responding"" popups while the app is functioning fine. The developers are great & go out of their way to help w/ troubleshooting. I'll update the rating when there's a fix for the links not working. Things that don't fix it: ""reset permissions"", restarting phone, clear cache, update ""system WebView"", force stop, un/reinstall, etc.",3
com.textra,Ash B,"I've used this app for years and it just keeps getting better and better! The only issue I currently have is the underlined date/time text - it used to work on my app so I could schedule appointments and events, but not I only get the ""copy"" and ""share"" options. It was really helpful for me because I always forget about events, I hope to see it fixed soon!!",4
com.textra,Ed Crain,"Update: I'm now about 2 years in. This app is consistently updated with useful features. The most recent is a feature that keeps personal notes just like a text you might send but using 'keep' as the destination, it will just keep it local like a text -without sending it anywhere remote. Older: I've been using Textra for several months now and am perfectly satisfied with the look, process, and options. I especially like scheduling a text to send later. Use the info text bot to learn tips.",5
com.textra,Renee B,THE best! Easy to use. All the functions I need or want. Updated regularly with all the best improvements. TextraBot tells me so ! I've been a loyal Textra user for a while (more than 2 years). I've supported the developers by getting the ad-free version and I've never had any regrets. They do a great job! I've installed on every phone. (Samsung) It's so much better than the factory message app! I especially love the ability to schedule the messages!,5
com.textra,Shawn Adamson,"Update 3: resync and removing battery restrictions seems to have worked. Wish dev had suggested that instead of blaming my carrier. Update 2: sent support email, but no response yet. I see another review with the same issue I have, but we have different carriers. Both our issues started around the same time. After an update. So which is more likely the issue? Dropped another star for being dismissive. Update: I can no longer send images through the app. That's a deal breaker.",4
com.textra,Miranda Bolden,"I've been using textra for years and love it. The personalization is beyond compare: colors, conversation icons and colors. There have been some hiccups along the way, and I have tried to like other texting apps; I just keep coming back to this app. it has the options and functionality I like. Can't go wrong.",5
com.textra,Anthony C,"It's unique and has many options and features, which will get confusing, especially for beginners. I like to see unread messages in BOLD and a way to mark read messages as unread. Their email support response time is quick, and the answers are improving. The 1-time purchase price for the pro version is pretty fair.",5
com.textra,Rhonda Edwards,"What I love about Textra is I can insert a picture of my own or a Gif exactly where it fits in with my text. If I send a caption with a picture, it loses its meaning if it doesn't send with that picture. Other texting apps are inferior when it comes to that feature...and that feature alone will keep me with Textra...even though I enjoy it for other reasons, too.",5
com.textra,R Sutton,"I loved this app for several years. Lately, when I send texts, I receive failure notices. This is so f'ing ANNOYING!!! 🙄What's the issue with this recently occurring??! Yes, the cache is cleaned daily, so please don't go there. I'm pretty tech savvy and there's absolutely no excuse. Please, find a fix!!! Good Lawd!! 🤬",3
com.textra,Daren Kelly,"Textra had been the best texting app for myself personally as it has everything I needed but I also like to use Phone Link a lot especially at home and at work. Lately Textra will not sync with Phone Link no matter what I do to try and fix it. I'm hoping this will be fixed sooner rather than later. It seems every update seems to break something and after paying for Textra, I feel after all this time using it, I'm going to have to ditch it for something that just works with my needs.",2
com.textra,Rebekah Kaskubar,"I've had textra for years, bought the no ads option very early on. I love the customization of the app. Just recently I had an issue with my notifications not showing up. I reached out to textra because I noticed that there were lots of positive reviews about customer service. They weren't kidding! After a bunch of emails back and forth, Max helped me solve the issue (which wasn't even a textra issue). Super helpful, the whole experience helped me convinced my husband to switch over too!",5
com.textra,Paul Demesa,"Textra’s user interface is much better than other text/SMS app I’ve tried. The one thing that’s missing is the ability to block groups of senders, in my case, all messages not from my contacts. The last mid-term US elections are a good example. Many candidates were spamming my phone. Also I don’t understand why Textra has to be the default SMS app for it to work. The default SMS app that came with the phone does.",4
com.textra,Kira Boyle,"Standard texting app. Nice interface, nice customization options. It's easy to add new people to conversations, and I've had no issues with message sending. Almost finished up my trial when I found it has (what I think) is an amazing feature to export an entire text conversation and send it as an email. Dropped some $$ on pro support for that feature alone. A+ devs.",5
com.textra,D N,"Overall a very good texting app. Loss of star is due to no archive options. There are a lot of texts I don't need to see cluttering my list, but don't want to delete either. Also there really needs to be a block option for junk text. These items are what's stopping me from getting the pro version and pondering looking around for other text options.",4
com.textra,Erik Van Betuw,"Textra is feature-rich and they keep improving it. During political season I have been inundated with fundraising texts, from both parties by the way, 6-10 a day at times. Recently Textra rolled out a new feature where texts from anyone not on my Contacts list can have their text notifications turned off or muted - and it is a lifesaver! I loved the app before this but now I am a Textra stan for life. ,",5
com.textra,Jared S,"I have been using Textra for years, on two phones now. There are ads but honestly it wasn't too long before I just paid for Premium and removed them forever. The default messaging app on my old phone was a nightmare so I tried this and it's such a gamechanger I'm never going back. Also I never review anything... but this is a fantastic app!",5
com.textra,chopstix906,"The last few updates I've had a few issues. MMS messages (group texts) often fail. I can't clear notifications within the app even after I open the text. Installed multiple updates that haven't fixed the issue. Update: MMS is still not working for some messages. I get the neverending ""Can't get MMS"" error notification. This is still an issue months later with most up to date version and a new phone (S22 Ultra).",3
com.textra,dawn,"Like it enough to buy the NoAd version. Seems to smoothly connect with everyone. It's pretty and simple and my favorite communication app. ONE YEAR UPDATE:. Still using it, still loving it. it has updated nicely and worked great with a OnePlus 6T. It's now 11\2022. Still love it. Using it now on a Samsung S22. I liked to customize individual chats and contacts. Smooth operation, dependable. And, I like the new keep feature!",5
com.textra,Anthony Esposito,"Constantly running into issues on pro version of sending and receiving text. At least a few times a week I get unable to receive text. It was solid until a year or so back when I sent my first response. Seems that others are having the same issue. Would hate to move to another app, but this is looking more realistic. Update 9/15/2022 Whatever you are doing now Textra now, keep it up. I have not run issues lately and I wanted the rating to reflect the work you all have done.",4
com.textra,Tori DelliCarpini,"Been a loyal Textra user for years since Samsung got rid of the ability to customize text tones for individual contacts. Always been pleased with the performance, updates, compatability, ease of use, and customizable options. I'm running a Samsung S22 Ultra, and while there is currently an issue with not receiving texts, Textra support was quick to help. I received an email response to the problem in three minutes, and I'm waiting to see if it solved the issue. I'm still a big fan.",5
com.textra,Sara,"I have used many texting apps and this is by far the best... Every time I've tried another I come back to textra. It's easy to use, an intuitive design, and super customizable. I have the pro version now but I used the free version without issue for a long time before upgrading. Developers, please add more variety of notification icons! I love being able to tell who texted me when my screen is locked.",5
com.textra,Papa Smurf,"Textra does it right. They just added a new feature allowing you to control how unknown numbers are handled. The ""right"" part is that the default behavior is what was happening before the feature was added. I point this out since my default text editor at work seems to always turn on the new feature. This means I find the new feature by unexpected behavior and have to hunt down how to turn it off. Textra saves me the time and frustration. Good for them.",5
com.textra,Beth Barnes,"I've been using Textra for years with absolutely no issues until recently. I've reached out to support and for a week, I've heard nothing. My messages are not being received! I have to manually restart my phone and they dump in. I've checked all permissions, notifications, and everything is exactly the same as what it was a month ago when I had no issues. I have been having issues with MMS messages constantly failing, which is also annoying, but not receiving regular texts is a serious issue!",1
com.textra,Kathy Silberman,"I have been using Textra for awhile now and really like it's features. Recently I had a question and reached out to the developers. I received immediate assistance and full understanding of my issue. Honestly, when I reached out I thought it was a long shot I'd receive a response. The customer service was excellent. Textra is by far my choice for a messaging app.",5
com.textra,GoBlue Wolverine,"Have used Textra for several years and has always been a great texting option! Fast, easy, and customizable! One thing that has happened lately, if someone sends me a hyperlink to a video it gives me 3 options, Open, Copy, or Share. The copy and share options work, but the open button does nothing. I have to copy and then open it elsewhere, which is inconvenient. Any ideas?",4
com.textra,Mary Lynn McKenzie,Have used Textra for a long time and it has been great. The last week or so it has not been delivering my message without restarting my phone...daily... this is a problem because I use my phone e for work. If I can't straighten it out I will have to change to a different app. I have not changed anything on my phone and when I look at settings everything looks OK to me. Could use a little help here. Thanks!,4
com.textra,Sean Falbee,"Would give it a 5 star if it was compatible with watches.. At least for the read function.. Notifications are a bit funky initially.. Missed a few messages, which didn't cost me anything, but could have.. But customization is on point.. Lots of choice.. Edit: ummm. This is pretty good now that I've been using it . I really have no complaints .. I mean yeah.. honestly I don't know how to improve it There is one thing.. The voice to text recording . It keeps locking when talking.",5
com.textra,Jose Pazos-Perez,"Definitely the best messaging app for Android in my opinion. It was a game changer for me once I switched to an Android fairly recently. The native texting app and the Google app are just so laggy. I also appreciate how the developers are always keeping updates going and are very quick to provide feedback. Google is trying to add more features to their messaging app when Textra has already done it and more. This should be the native app for all Android phones. And yes, pay for the Pro Version.",5
com.textra,Mary John,"I've used Textra for years and love it. After a recent phone upgrade, I stopped receiving text notifications, despite notification settings being set up correctly. I reached out to the Textra team via email and they patiently walked me through a few potential fixes until the problem was solved. (For anyone dealing with the same issue, Android Settings > Apps > Textra > (Storage) [Clear Data] is what worked on my Samsung S22 Ultra.) I was blown away by the prompt, kind, helpful support. :)",5
com.textra,Jonathan Lopez,I have been using Textra for years when I was made aware of the app as a better alternative to Samsung text app. The features and options give you flexibility and functionality. However recently I have been experiencing sent fails when grouping text and MMS. It is quiet annoying especially when trying to send message that are time sensitive. Honestly I would like to see Textra fix the issues instead of having to go try the Google text app.,2
com.textra,Cody,"I've used Textra since 2013. It's got the best features, design, and UI for android phones on the market. Sadly, Textra has fallen behind in cross-device support. We're on Gen-5 of most smart wearables. It's pretty disappointing to have to choose between my favorite SMS app and using my wearable the way I bought it to be used. If you can provide that support, you're back up to 5 stars. I have to switch to Pulse SMS until then, don't let them keep me! You can still win the game! Just update:)",3
com.textra,Tatiana Vasilyev,"Been using this app for years. After the update, my texts are not coming through. Have to restart phone to get them. Have tried the defualt messaging app on my phone and my texts come through. Kind of sucks that I paid for the pro version of Textra and now it's not working. Really annoying. Don't know what the developers did to cause this after the recent update, but there is an obvious issue and it needs to be fixed please. Disappointed.",1
com.textra,Hypershell,"Great app with lots of customization options. I use it so I can assign unique alert sounds to specific contacts. However, it has one critical flaw: Spam and FRAUD from email accounts. You'd think it would be easy to auto-block texts coming from an email address and not an actual phone number (which no legit business does), but no such option exists. It should. I am tired of random email boxes trying to steal my bank info by claiming a card/account was frozen; this is a big security issue.",4
com.textra,Ellie Marciniak,"Easy to use and promise of secure messages made it my choice of texting app. My recent experience has been equal to my original first sentence herein. My complaint is lack of audible tones that announce a text delivery. Without the tone notification, I don't know that a text has come in to me. If it's because tones in Messenger would not transfer to Textra, I don't know a way activate any notification at all. Therefore I reduced my rating to four stars.",4
com.textra,Katie Lit,got it years ago to replace the samsung stock app when it stopped allowing you to assign ring sounds to the texts. i've been very happy with the app and the support team is top notch. they recently added a feature to help stop political text msgs so that's amazing. keep up the feature releases textra! worth the premium price/mo for a smooth user friendly experience.,5
com.textra,A.,"Was 5 stars until I discovered the pro version is $7.. I'd say it's more worth the $3 range, it's a text message app. It's got one main function.. I've switched back to Google Messages which does the same thing for free. REPLY TO DEV: There is no ""Manage Ads"" option in my app, I went through every single option. I also never said trial for features, I said trial until ads are displayed. <<They've since updated their app description..",2
com.textra,Don “MowerMan” Burgess,I've had this app for yrs and loved it. Now it stops after opening and goes back to home screen frustrating as hell. I've sent reports and big reports so many times I can't keep track anymore. I've uninstalled and reinstalled works for a minute then the same old thing. If not fixed I will be done with it. Which since I've had no help to this point I'm sure this review won't matter. But I look forward to your Bot automated reply like everyone else receives.,2
com.textra,F G,"This app works super well for sending and receiving text messages. NO ONE, not even Google messages or any other premium messaging app that I have used can handle the amount of pictures you can send at one time like TEXTRA does. Many things just happen in the background which is perfect. ONLY reason it is a four star is i feel the app should be more modern looking and fluid in its experience. Something more along the lines of FB Messenger or IG messages in prettiness but TEXTRA dependability.",4
com.textra,Sidd Gould,"Please add the ability to take a text and make it go to other apps like reminder apps with all of its information from the text .. also some type of Notifier when you get a text that stands out with a pop-up , No one tries harder to have a great app than this developer. Constantly updating it to make it state-of-the-art for all the different versions of upgrades and operating systems of the date on Android 12 which many apps are not. Keep up the good work you're appreciated",5
com.textra,C. H.M.,"Textra is, without a doubt, the best text app available. I've been using it for years and still nothing compares. It's updated regularly with very useful new features. The devs are very responsive whenever I've had a question, and the rare occasions when I've encountered an issue.",5
com.textra,Nichole Lodrigue,I love this app! It's the only app where I can customize not only the colors the notifications the icons. If I have any technical difficulties developer is quick to email me back with a solution. After lots of Android phones made it to where you can't customize notifications for individual contacts I tried many text apps and this one is by far the best!,5
com.textra,Vince Badovinatz,I really like the Textra app. It has a lot of nice features that the others don't. And it has features. that the other ones do have that are nice. Textra really does respond quickly if you have a problem. you can go right through the contact us portion and get a hold of them. they reply quite quickly.. It's a very good texting app I hope you guys like it. It's a great app,4
com.textra,Sean Gatton,"I know there's a problem with S22 Ultra receiving messages, so I know it's not Textra's fault: it can only show what the phone itself receives. Aside from that (which is not their fault), the experience is amazing. My one request is for you to make a WearOS version as well. The inability to set it on my Galaxy Watch 4 means if I want to use my watch to quick reply because my phone isn't near me, or in my pocket, I have to hard swap default SMS apps on my phone.",5
com.textra,ashley smith,"Good txt msngr app. Fast. Easy to use. So many ways to customize ! Sounds, colors of contacts, bubbles, led flash, icon for notification bar, etc. I'd been using another app since 2013, a Korean based one, and it stopped working Fri night and I switched to this. So happy I did! The copy ability, all or part, quick select most recent picture, ease of sharing, all top notch.",4
com.textra,Angela Ronkowski,"So, I have been using Textra for several years now. IMO Its about as good as it gets. Never had any problems. I've gotten rid of any and all msgs and media files or attachments that are not important or redundant. Kept about 150 msgs. I clear the cache often. The curious thing is that it takes up over 800mb (nearly a GB)of data in the internal storage. My phone only has 32 GB of storage. That's alot of resources. Is that normal or does that seem odd? Do you guys EVER respond to reviews?",4
com.textra,KC “KCGlobal” Corey,"WAS my Coolest, Best Designed SMS App. NOW (11/11/22) I can't text long texts, pics, emojis etc. NOR can I receive them. Used to. TCL phone updated before these issues happened. NOW only short texts sending and receiving. Cannot find where to change settings, either in App or phone. Too much time. Old: I have had many pre-installed and apps I've tried. I keep this one because it's got all the important and fun features that matters. Colors, styles, fun icons, reports and stellar support. Try it!",5
com.textra,Mike W,"A truly great app. Can't believe the customization options. Great work by developer and awesome support for issues! I highly recommend this app not just as a great alternative for Android users looking to circumvent data collection from Google's messaging app, but any user looking to add a level of customization to their messaging app that isn't possible with any of the other top messaging apps!",5
com.textra,Adam Colbert,"I recently got a new phone. I wanted a SMS/MMS app that WASN'T powered by Google! One quick read of the reviews convinced me that THIS is the texting app I'm looking for!!! Upon installing the app, no ""setup"" process required, all the previous messages/conversations seamlessly transferred over! I haven't even used the app ad I already feel good about it, ESPECIALLY after all the rock solid reviews I read!",5
com.textra,Coreen Hayes,"I loved the Verizon App before I got Textra. The reason I switched was because pictures were no longer sending for Verizon messages. I cleaned the app and did everything (right) just stopped working. I can send ten pics in a feed on Textra SMS and it all goes through. I am sure I will never switch again for as long as this app works like a charm, I will remain loyal!",5
com.textra,unbecoming2007 Truther,"Best text app out there, but fails bad in one of the most important areas - THE VERY TEXT U LOOK AT COUNTLESS TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY. For an app that is so customizable how is that we only get 3 FONTS ( Yes I said 3 ) to choose forever ? Makes zero sense to me. Almost everything has so many options to personalize yet FONTS ( HELLO, it's a textin app lol ), NOPE. NO FONTS FOR YOU. Wouldn't u think this very setting would come before almost everything in the "" customizing options "" dept ?",4
com.textra,Gina L.,"Unfortunately I had to go back to my default messaging app because this one wasn't working for me. It would fail to receive too many messages and if I accidentally clicked the ad on the top it would keep reopening until I restarted the app. If they can fix these issues, I would use it again because I like the customization features.",1
com.textra,KC Young,"Been using it for years but now messages will fail to send. Based on dev responses here I've reset my network several times and all it does is send a batch of messages and then goes back to failing. Please fix this, this is clearly an app issue. Even if it's a Samsung update issue like you are claiming, then it's your responsibility to make it work with the OS instead of just blaming Samsung.",1
com.textra,The1Ring,"Works well in all areas, no glitches so far. Very fluid and clean app. Pictures, emojis, gif all work. Would like to see more options for fonts e.g.cursive, comic sans etc. No Ads in app is temporary. The ads are not intrusive and doesn't bother me. I like the the updates which adds more features while making the current ones perform better.",5
com.textra,JDupree3,"A simple, wonderfully customizable app that handles mms and sms messages better than your stock app. Before I had the app, I would get problems with groups not working, issues with emojis, and missing pictures and gifs. This app smooths out the experience, fixing those problems, all while giving you the freedom to make the app function and look exactly how you want it to. Get this app.",5
com.textra,Emily Thompson,"I have been using this app for years and have the paid version, I've tried tons of other texting apps and none have come close to how much I love this one! The color coding is a top-tier, can't live without it feature. I'm finally writing a review in hopes that you guys could add the Material You for Google Pixel icon functionality!! Thank you!! Edit 9/24/22: thank you for adding this pixel feature!!! my home screen looks perfect now! will never use another texting app again!!!!",5
com.textra,G K,"Easy to use with lots of cool features and personalization. I had used Textra before with a previous phone and did not download it with my new phone for several months. Decided to give it a try again, and it has only improved! Purchasing the pro version has been a wonderful decision and I'd do it again!",5
com.textra,Barry,Threat Warning.. my software (Eset Mobile) warned that this app was an Android/TrojanDownloader. Agent. AEN and it should be removed. I did so & reinstalled it from the Play Store but was warned again not to install it for the same reason. Totally bummed as I've used it for years without issue and I 100% loved this app. Now what? UPDATE: That worked!! THANK YOU so much for resolving that issue. I'm ecstatic!,5
com.textra,Maureen B,"I keep coming back to Textra! Since I got my new Samsung Galaxy S20FE, Textra has been showing some recently received & opened texts as unread. That's the only reason I only gave it 4 stars. So I tried a couple other texting apps. None of them looked as good as Textra and they didn't seem to be as customizable. I especially love that I can enlarge the text! Hopefully the unread texts bug will get worked out. Willing to put up with the annoyance because I love everything else about the app!",4
com.textra,chevymontecarlo2003,"My original messages started having intermittent problems after an update. Installing this fixed that. Textra working GOOD! Only thing missing, old notification used to announce when I had a new text. No option 2 config that now but not a big deal. * Is there a way to configure a temporary DRIVING MODE for a user specified number of minutes with a user configured automated response ? If not may that possibly be in a future release?",5
com.textra,Jay Lebeda,"i rarely do this but ive got to say this textra has impressed me. EVERY app advertises ""personalization"" or ""customizable"", ya with all the option potential of a zipper. maybe its the phones and computers i used at the time (or the available at your own risk programming i used) but I feel like i had way more control over how my device functioned 15 years ago. textra gave me a taste of that feeling back. keep doing what your doing",5
com.textra,Camden Courcier,"My main reason to switch to Textra was to be able to snip out pieces of text from a message. The fact that the Android native app is incapable of that is unbelievable to me. So far I have found nothing that the Google made Android, texting native app could do that. texture can't do better. But I will qualify that by saying I have only been using it for about 2 months. So more will be revealed.",5
com.textra,Pat Orlowski,"It's been my favorite texting app for the longest time, but ever since I switched to the Zenfone 9 things got wonky... Though not receiving some text messages could very well be a phone-side problem, Textra has not sent my scheduled messages out on time ever. It only sends them when I wake the phone up. The app has full permissions, too... Not sure what to do.",2
com.textra,Jessa Turner,"I've tried many texting apps & this is by far my favorite. The others were either too cutesy, glitchy somehow or incompatible with my Samsung Galaxy (?) 🙄 This one is just simple enough to be easy to use but has all the extras you could wish for. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",5
com.textra,C Washington,"I got this to color code group messages (after too many near misses - one work related) and I would love it, except... THE NOTIFICATION BUBBLES DON'T GO AWAY AFTER YOU READ THE MESSAGES. This is driving me absolutely insane. So I turned off notifications and now I'm missing messages. Looking for a replacement now. If they'd fix this, it would be AWESOME. But until they do, I have to switch.",2
com.textra,Soar -,"🔖My rating is for my experience, not that of others. Allow backup to a file for 5 stars. STILL no way to backup all settings to a file. Have to change my 👍🏽 to👎🏽. Textra only backs up to Google. I don't want that. No option to disable it or back up to a JSON/CSV file. Old review: 3 big features that I find it lacking are the ability to pinch & zoom to change text size when viewing messages, the ability to mark a message as unread, & the ability to search for emoji by keyword.",1
com.textra,Marc Smith Jr,"This is by far my favorite and preferred texting app. I've been using it for years and always replace the stock Android messaging app on every phone I've owned with Textra. Beginning yesterday, my MMS messages will ONLY send if I restart my phone. It's a terribly annoying bug. I DO NOT have a Samsung device, so please don't suggest that network reset option. I own a OnePlus 10 pro. I've tried resetting my APN as well. Phone restart has been the ONLY solution I've found. Please fix this issue.",3

com.textra,Rj Landis,"I used to love this texting app. First app I've paid for. But it just is super unreliable these days. Over the past 1.5 months, I have so many messages that just fail to send. Especially MMS. I reboot, uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared all connection settings per support recommendation, and it may or may not work for a couple days or weeks and then back to constant failures. I've switched back to the stock Messages app for my Galaxy but wish the app I paid for worked like it used to.",3
com.textra,cathy blum,I love using Textra. I prefer it over the plain message app because of the emojis and its ability to allow me to add words & accents to the memory that are not in the dictionary! I do have one very annoying issue. All apps show up when I want to share a photo but exclude Textra 70% of the time..not allowing me to share! I wish I could find a solution.,5
com.textra,Jessica Minden (gamergirl),This has been my go-to texting app for years. Recently the heads up notification on my android went missing. I didn't realize how much I liked seeing the text message at the top of my screen over what I was doing until it was gone. The chat bubbles are NOT an alternative. They get stuck on my screen and won't go away. Horrible things.... Update: hallelujah the chat bubbles can be turned off. I still miss the text message overlay for 5 to 10 seconds. Now I see 3 words for 2 seconds.,4
com.textra,Lori Barnes,"I love Textra, I been using it for years. I'm glad they are advancing to different/new features on app. I wish they would add a feature that you can hit like & add a quick text response option in return to a text received. And option to see if text was opened or not available. Would be great to show when a person was responding to a text. Textra has really grown. I love it & I hope they continue to make more neat features you can use.",4
com.textra,Hann Henson,I've used Textra for years. Solid app that never seems to have any stability issues or otherwise. What I love about it is its robust customization features that allow you to color code your chats and assign custom chat sounds. Features I would love to see would be a more in-depth message backup feature and maybe some sort of pc integration.,5
com.textra,Gerald Markowitz,"I have been using the pay version of Textra for quite some time. Some features that are helpful: 1. You can’t send a text to a contact without the contact’s phone number being identified as a MOBILE number. So, you can’t accidentally send a text message to a land line. 2. Their support is excellent. Every question or issue I have had with my phone is answered almost immediately. 3. There are several customizations in the settings that let you have the display of messages the way you want it",5
com.textra,Kay Norman,"I continue to be impressed with the customer service. If I have a problem or question and reach out, I have an immediate answer! I have enjoyed using Textra for the past few years. I recently had an issue where I was not receiving the sounds notification for incoming texts. I contacted the developers re the problem. They got immediately back to me and the issue was immediately corrected. Great job!",5
com.textra,Tyler Clarkson,"EDIT: Thanks for pointing out the fact that I can move ads. That helps alot. Me. It works ok. I hate the attachment of media process. Also, the ads at the top appear on a delay, so when you open the app, your most recent message is at the top, and right as you go to tap it, the ad replaces it and you end up clicking the ad instead. Looking for something better and will eagerly jump ship when I find it.",3
com.textra,Brandi Darlas,"The margins in the text message window are glitchy. The margins seem to be eating my words. The words are still there but can't be seen or are only partially visible. When this happens at a point where there is an emoji present it looks like it is cut in half. I like textra it is one of my go to apps, but I also like proofreading my texts before sending them. Sent email to tech support. Not sure if it was received. Using a different app for now. Please fix... thank you.",3
com.textra,Ann D.,"I love this app! It's so customizable, and they're always adding cool new features. They recently added the ability to react to messages, and to see react icons. It makes messaging more fun, and easier with my iPhone friends! I also recently had to contact them with an issue. They responded SO quickly, and solved my problem. I was shocked to hear back at all, much less within an hour!",5
com.textra,jamr514,I highly recommend this app. I can customize ringtones for each person and color code conversations (I have chosen to set a theme of Hogwarts House colors for everyone's texts). The only thing I would really change is I wish there were more colors for the font for texts (only four). It's far superior to the app that came with my phone. I like that I can customize where the ads are in the free version. It's easy to sort out previously sent pictures from text too.,5
com.textra,M. Freeman,"About the only thing that's really bothering me is that the send key is in a terrible spot and in the first 6 hours of having the app I accidentally sent 8 messages before I was done typing by accidentally hitting that damn key. I seem to be the only one having this issue though. Lol It's very annoying. Seems to be a great app otherwise but I've only used it for a few days. There's no ads that I've seen, it's customizable, it has most of the options I want but that damn send key is annoying.",4
com.textra,Barbara Sinnott,"I started using Textra when my phone's internal messaging app became dysfunctional after a system upgrade. When the phone system was fixed, I just couldn't go back to it. Textra has so many extra features and all in living color for coding! That was 2 years ago, and Textra has never had a problem. Just keeps getting better as they add capabilities with updates.",5
com.textra,Chris Phoenix,"Back using this again, and it has been stable. Noticed that it isn't clearing the new message indicator in app unless I open the message a second time. Tried reinstalling, hope it helps. Edit: Reinstall did not help, so it has to do with the script. Currently you have to press your back button (Android) after viewing the message for the new message indicator to go away. It will not clear if you read the message and immediately quit.",4
com.textra,Steve Blitz,"Using Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra for a few months with Textra. Lately I'm having issues when sending out a photo or two. It shows that it's sending, however, it takes anywhere from a minute upto 5 or more minutes for the file to go out. The size of the photos are small at 1/2mb or so. This issue began to occur over the past couple of weeks. I did reset the cache, however it didn't fix the issue. Please advise.",3
com.textra,Ty J.,I've been using Textra for over 5 years and I love this app. The customization options make it my go to for a new phone. The new feature for emoji reactions to texts is a nice touch. Hopefully we can get that for images as well. The ONE thing I have a gripe with is the screen flashing white when I back out of a conversation to the main screen. I don't remember it doing this before but I could be wrong. Still giving the app 5 stars though. But that white flash is definitely slightly annoying.,5
com.textra,Caroline,"I have been a textra user for well over 8 years. I have found it to be exceptional in security, preferences, updates, performance and feedback. Also every update is followed by a textra text bot with an explanation of the update in its entirety along with past update information. Give them a try... You will not ""turn back""! ""Share as email"" works like a dream. ;)Just when l think it can't get any better they now have added ""undo delete."" Wow!👍",5
com.textra,Ulrick Andre,"I've been using textra since 2017. Since then I've had five different phones and each one I installed textra. I love the many customizable options textra offer. I can customize each text for each individual contact. I just love that. I'll highly recommend. Textra has been and will continue to be my go to app for texting. My only issue with textra is that sometimes when sending mms messages, it tends to lag and also fails to send the mms message. That's my only issue with the app.",5
com.textra,Mya Mueller,"I really like this app! It is highly customizable, allowing you to change contact notifications, colorcode conversations, and even choose the location for ads if you choose to stick with the free version as I have. Updates and new features are released often with the recent ability to react to messages, and see reaction icons. This new feature has made texting with my iphone-using friends much more fun! The app is extremely user friendly and the customer service for the help desk is wonderful!",5
com.textra,Adam Stephens,Love this app. Being able to customize the colors and the chat bubbles is exactly what I've been looking for. My suggestions would be to be able to set different color settings for light mode and then a different set of color settings for dark mode though. Maybe some pre-done color templates would be cool too. Keep up the great work!,4
com.textra,Elizabeth Gray,I've lived this app for years but lately I can't send images. They bounce back with a green exclamation point. Occasionally they are going v through and the person will receive it several times even though I'm still getting error message. It's just been the past few weeks. Not sure what's up. Really frustrating though.,3
com.textra,Ben B,"I love this app but I'm having trouble with a feature. When sharing a link from another app to Textra my recent conversations aren't shown as available, instead a blank box with the search icon at the top. This is suprisingly inconvenient. It didn't used to be this way. I can't seem to find a remedy in settings. ???",3
com.textra,Chelsea Williams,"This is the absolute best texting/messaging app I've ever used!! Before Textra I often got an error or text not sent message when trying to send multiple pics. What prompted me to write this review is that I, just now, successfully sent 14 pictures to a friend IN ONE SINGLE MESSAGE!!! Outstanding!! All of the customizing features are a ton of fun! There are ZERO AD INTERRUPTIONS!! This app has NEVER FAILED me!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TEXTRA TO ALL!!! It's absolutely wonderful!!! Thank you TEXTRA!",5
com.textra,Zocial E,I've been using Textra for many many years and I am not switching anytime soon. I can say that it has been one of the best investment I have ever done on an any app. Lot's of cool features but it takes time to learn. Learn the basics first for a good flow then explore deeper for a better experience. Have fun with it party people!,5
com.textra,Rhona,default texting app was faulty and was difficult to turn off read-receipts. No problems with that here. The one downside is that the app is only ad-free on a trial basis and is not clear about it until they ask you to upgrade. Luckily the upgrade is very inexpensive for a good app.,4
com.textra,Geoff Zalot,"I've been using Textra for years and have been happy with it. I would love to see a settings back/restore feature. It would also be nice if you could select the Account Textra uses to name Contacts as they appear within Textra. Individual conversation settings used to be more customizable, e.g., font colors, colors for each side of the conversation (i.e. a different color for yourself in certain contacts than the standard one you use for yourself, etc.). I'd like to see those options return.",4
com.textra,Tron Starking,"I really enjoy this app a lot. I even paid for it. I would just like a bit more costumization. For example: 1. Adding a different background to every chat, as apposed to only black. 2. Being able to costumize the reaction bar that was just added. 3. Adding an incoming text sound while you leave your phone on in the chat, as apposed to needing to hear the notification again. I really hope my suggestions will be considered. Mood is another messaging app that offers A LOT of costumization. Thanks!",5
com.textra,Andrew Alquisira Sr.,Add/remove people from chat feature is needed. Not a fan of the limitations this app has from Google but it's still one of the best customizable text apps. But the ability to add and remove recipients from chat groups has been a long requested feature. It's standard on stock Android. Any hope this feature will ever show up? Edit: how in the hell do we use the undo delete option? The demo isn't clear I I've tried tapping the green box but nothing. Now the box is gone.,3
com.textra,Gia DiCamillo,"After the latest update (Aug 2022), it takes over 3-5s after me hitting the send button for the text to leave the typing area and go to the conversation area to be sent. Very annoying because I'm stuck waiting until I can go anywhere else or type another message. Hope this gets fixed because I've used this app for years but I'll have no choice to change apps if it doesn't get fixed.",2
com.textra,Caryn Newell,MMS timeout! 🙄 Been getting this error all day so far. I just put the app on my phone yesterday. I had it on my previous phone but ended up switching to VZW messages. Switched carriers and used Google messages but thought I would give Textra another try. Looks like I'll have to go back to Google messages. I really like the ability to customize Textra. I was really hoping it would work better.,3
com.textra,T N,Love the app. Unfortunately I have issues when attempting to send pictures. It will just keep trying to send and come back as failed. Samsung Galaxy S21. Update seems to have fixed my issue. Developers very responsive. I do have the paid version and it's worth every penny. I love that we can now reaction emojis. Thank you!,5
com.textra,Frans Wartenberg,"I've been using the Pro version for years, and it works great. With the growing levels of spam in SMS/Texting, there are a few features I'd like to see: A) ability to block list AND remove message. Right now it's either/or, and when you move to a new phone all the old blacklisted messages show up again. B) ability to auto-delete or turn off notifications for messages that come from an ""unknown"" source; the sending number is not in my contacts, and/or a central whitelist with banks, usps etc",5
com.textra,Big Guy Mal,"I've been using this app for many years now. It's a great texting app, and I love being able to customize the appearance as much as I can. I don't think I have anything negative to say about the app, overall! I do wish I could add a background image to my text conversations — but that is far from a necessary feature, so whatever. I still highly suggest Textra to anyone. I definitely suggest paying for it, because it is worth it, but the free version is fine, if you don't want to or can't pay.",5
com.textra,Andrew Kordula,"I've used textra for a few years now and love it. I felt compelled to write a review now because of the incredible support I received. After the latest Android update, my phone randomly will stop receiving text messages. Now, even though my issue wasn't resolved because we found it's not an app issue, the prompt support I received from Textra's support team (Max) was top notch. That kind of treatment is why I would highly recommend Textra!",5
com.textra,AKBees,"i've been using this app for many years now but one thing that continues to bug me is the buggy MMS. every time someone tries to send me an MMS it times out w/o fail (""can't receive MMS; timeout, click to try again""). i have to click the notification several times in order to get attachments, super annoying. with all the fixes they do you think they would fix that.",4
com.textra,Classic Corey,An app that finally does what I need. Google Messenger doesn't notify me when a text fails. Chomp only shows one line of text from the messages in push notifications. This fixes all those problems and much more. I also sincerely appreciate the extensive customization options as well as the wonderful customer support.,5
com.textra,a “acd” d,"Long time user with zero complaints. Reliable and always improving, Textra delivers 100%, 100% of the time. Flexibility keeps it fun and functional. I appreciate the ability to delay text delivery giving u time to revise or change a text. Pinning important texts to the top is a +. UI customization is both fun and functional. The ability to perform well regardless of phone, processor or storage means no worries when upgrading my phone. Fast! Awesome tech support if ever needed. Luv it!",5
com.textra,Esther,"The BEST texting app out there! 5/5 recommend. Download for a trial period then pay $5 for the pro ad-free version, it's worth it. Every feature you can think of is customizable (fonts, colors, text bubble shape, notification icons, emoji style, etc). The developers are constantly upgrading the features based on user feedback, so you can post suggestions/contact the developers if there's anything the app is missing",5

Update: Textra contacted me, I changed some settings and now it's working great!",5
com.textra,Sammy Conway,"its actually real good. There's ads but they aren't invasive and you can even choose where you want them to be on the screen.

For being reliable with no popup ads, I give 5 stars. 👍",5

I had one textra message to one person only come back with the ""!"" error message. I also got a notification that  the message  didn't go through. However, it did go through.  I've been a fan since I started using this app several months ago, but I can't use an app that doesn't work the way it always has.  I love Textra, is there a way to address this please?",2
com.textra,Jackie “Amber” Morris,"It's a great app. You can customize the colors for the sender and receiver. I just wish I could change the background to pictures instead of just the white, gray, or black. Would be cool to be able to change the background for each person.

com.textra,Bn3RD,Well I love it but my Samsung A13 won't play any sound notifications I don't thinks it's the app more or less but when I first installed it the sound notifications worked then they just stopped. I tried all the suggested fixes for the phone but nothing works for this app to make the notification sound work. Which means I will have to go back to the default app for messages.,4

com.textra,Becky Dafoe,"One more needed feature-Would be awesome to know if a message had been delivered and when it's been read. Other text apps display a check mark system for texts sent and also when read. Like WhatsApp... 1 check for successfully sent, 2 checks for successfully delivered and checks turn blue once recipient has read the text. Definitely the best texting app out there today. And they're absolutely IS an automatic backup for all of your settings as long as you have your Google backup turned on!",5
com.textra,David Brager,"I got a new Samsung s22 from a Verizon upgrade as my Mom wanted 24/7 access to my wife and I and trust in our phones working (we were on Pay per month TracFones and local continuity sucked). I went to Textra to replace the default app in the phone from Samsung, which is inferior to the quality of app Textra delivers. Ads are not intrusive for a free app. Very nice. So, today, I paid for the full no ads version. Thank you for a great upgrade to my life.",5
com.textra,Ben Mendez,"Best text app in the market; bar none. Inclusion of replying to messages with emojis almost completes the experience and puts it almost on par with iMessage. Some limitations exist but that's most likely attributed to Android so I can't fault the app. Would love replying with emojis on pictures/videos, maybe a way to send iMessages (or another option) and bypass SMS for quality video sending. But it's fantastic.",5
com.textra,Aidan Stevenson,"I used to love Textra - I've been a Pro user for three years, but I cannot justify using it any longer. Recently, the vibration settings for the notifications are completely gone and ALL notifications no longer follow what you have set in the Android System Settings. I have the ""Heartbeat"" pattern selected (two short pulses), but the Textra app notifications just vibrate as a one-second-long buzz that is incredibly annoying. Until this is fixed, I will unfortunately no longer be using Textra.",2

Tyou can customize it so much it reminds me of the old default andriod texting app. Exactly what I was looking for!

If anything it's nice becuase I can actually reach the top text thread without using two hands. Can't recommend this enough!",5
com.textra,jason root,"It's a good app but frustrating as hell to use if you try to respond to a pop up text notification. One response...and poof, no more dialog box.

I was SO impressed with the quick help!",5
com.textra,twixx C,Legit a great app. If you have issues or questions you get very fast replies and help. I've considered leaving and going stock and I always come back to textra. With pro version you have so many customizations but also everything works exactly as text apps should. You can genuinely make this app do whatever you need. Only thing I would like to see is new developments or customizations but there is definitely something to be said for consistency.,5
com.textra,Kathy S,"8/15/22: It keeps getting better. It has undo a delete and delay sending to give time to correct. 7/5/22: This is a great app. When Google ruined Messages, I looked fervently for a solid text messenger. This is it! What sold me was being able to pin most contacted people to the top. I miss the Google Messages archive folder, but pinning to top is the next best thing. I'm happy and purchased the ad-free Pro version as a thank you. I only wish I could tap a link and go directly to the site.",5

The default vibration type (long) definitely saps more power than I'm used to seeing. Options would be nice. All other texting apps have them.",4

That and the need for apps gives that a 3 stars, but I have been enjoying using textra overall so I won't penalize the rating for using a free app",5
com.textra,Sandysan46,Love Textra so much. So easy to set up and favorite feature is to be able to give a special color to identify certain contacts. I'm so glad to have found Textra and will use it always as my means of text contact. This will be the only texting app that has the Best of Everything. Leaves Google Messages miles behind.,5
com.textra,Marley Hawn,"Love this app and how you can customize all the colors, would give 5 stars if when opening a message it would open the thread to the last read message instead of having to scroll through and find where you left off when getting a bunch of text messages.",4
com.textra,brian,"It works, but you can no longer customize the vibrate function, it's just one way too long buzz for everyone. It feels the same exact way as if you were getting a phone call for a split second. Very annoying and deceiving",3
com.textra,Pamela Martin,"BYE-BYE...I always used to love this app, but lately it has been a nightmare! My texts just hang there and send whenever they damn well please. When people send me texts they can arrive an hour after they've been sent. Group texts are a joke now... I've already emailed customer service and they were unable to help. REVISION:GREATLY IMPROVED!",4
com.textra,Kris Ludeman,I have been using your app for over 5 years and have always loved it but since the last update if I try to send a picture and type a message it erases the picture and leaves a exclamation point. I have to send the picture separately and quickly before it erases it. Please fix this cuz I love your app. Kris,5
com.textra,John Cheater,"Excellent app with everything I need for messaging, however only 4 stars as I would like to have longer repeat notification times. Every 2 minutes is annoying when I can't get to the phone. Would like 10 minutes or a choice. Otherwise brilliant.",4
com.textra,Nic Christeller,"Great app, been using it for years. Feature request: ignore (mark read automatically?) messages that match certain text. Use case: my carrier regularly sends me messages I don't care about. I don't want to block them completely because very occasionally they send me a crucial message.",5
com.textra,Jesse Hoffman,"I've been using this app for over 5 years. I think I like it but I'm never sure if my messages get sent or are received. I have found in the past that some people never received an important message I sent. It seems like it won't let me share links to Verizon customers. Also when sending photos or video to an iphone, the iphone user receives a pixelated photo or video.",5
com.textra,Sage Clack,The app is fine. Color choices are nice. The only drawback is it shows an unread message when there are no unread messages. It's the reason for the four stars are not the five. Could also be nice to have the emoji comments as they do in the native app.,4
com.textra,J.D. Simmons,After trying several other SMS apps to replace the stock (non)app on my Samsung phone I decided on this one immediately upgrading to the Pro version after the trial. So far it's been easy to use and no problems. I like the options for customization.,5

com.textra,G Batt,Great app! Excellent functionality and customization. I recently upgraded to 4.56 and for some reason I'm not getting notification sound when a text comes in. Can you help? I want to upgrade to 4.57 however this option is not available in Google Play store.,4
com.textra,PinkHibiscusx,"EDIT: Thank you to the developer for helping me find the feature I needed. Keep up the great work.

com.textra,Brian K,"Really fantastic texting app! The delayed send feature is a an absolute godsend and it alone is worth the price of admission. Add matching iPhone emojis, and other features, and you have a excellent alternative to the default texting app.",5
com.textra,Saucy Sammy,"Usually a Super~Fan, but of late, this App disappoints. While trying to send pictures, some emojis, anything MMS .. Message says, ""Can't get MMS timeout."" OTHER USERS are having the SAME PROBLEM. Never had this worry before. Please fix. I don't WANT to have to delete Textra. Thanking~You❣️",2
com.textra,Steven Otero,Only rate it 3 stars because it doesn't have auto reply when driving. Adding auto reply would make this a 5 star and the best texting app out there. This should be something added to make it safe when driving so as to not be distracted. Please add auto reply like the Verizon message+ texting app has built-in.,3
com.textra,Ruth Campbell,"This is my primary texting app. I really like the scheduling capability and the customer service is prompt and very helpful. My issue affected the app but was not a problem with the app. I have the paid for ""no ad"" version on my s21 Ultra.",5
com.textra,Lluvias Rain,"Wonderful app. I originally wrote a review from my older Google account, but idk where it's at, lol. I'll just review from this one again. They deserve all the good reviews, anyways! I've been using Textra for so many years.. even when its features were much more simple. Always was the most reliable texting app I could find across a series of different devices, too. Many years and phones later, each update just keeps getting better. Thank you to the team behind it!!",5
com.textra,M L Patterson Fisher,"Texting done right. I've recommended Texttra to several people. The customization is great, and honestly, well worth the upgrade to Pro, which I did after the first few days of use. Great app!",5
com.textra,Clint “Phantom Echoes”,Previous review heaped high praise of this app with the exception that you couldn't like text. Now you can. Best text app. Runs circles around it's competitors. Also props to the developers for sending knowledge base articles to school people on how to spot fraudulent and malicious text!👌🏿👏🏿,5
com.textra,Therese Jovich,"This app has a lot of customizations like fonts, icons respond to a message with a emoticon. I really like that option. Googleessages does that but your limited. you can also share large videos with this app so much easier than my stock message app.",5
com.textra,Lisa Sebesta,I've used textra for years and love it!. Twice needed support (wasn't a textra issue but a android/samsung issue both times).

com.textra,Uche Okoronkwo,"Good Job by Developer. Fast in Sending and Receiving Messages. One thing is lacking in the App. There should be a provision for Archived messages, as in Pulse and Google Messages. Please do something about this. Some messages aren't supposed to be left open. Thank You",5

Within minutes I had the answer on how to fix. I wish I would have asked a year ago! Textra Support for the win!",5
com.textra,Matthew D,"Really good app. Continuous improvements. The ability to archive messages (as opposed to deleting them) would make this an easy 5 out of 5, however I will withold a fifth star until that feature is implemented Did I mention message archiving and thread locking?

com.textra,Aaron Schoeffler,"Could you add automatic detection of MMS as best you can? Isn't there a list maintained somewhere? If not, do your own research and as the ten biggest carriers in the world, as well as the ten biggest in the USA. This is two people's 1 day of work and could be backwards compatible with the current version. That or have you considered adding in plugin support? Your Textra as Default User count would skyrocket because there are so many people who need automated proc but can't find a top tier app.",5
com.textra,Tammy McLendon,I love this app despite the fact I have to eventually delete and reinstall. It grows like a monster and eats up my space! Is there anything to help this? Editing....used this app since 2019. Still love the app. My issue at this point is I can't directly open links in messages. I have to tap the pop-up to open links. Other than that it's great,4
com.textra,Laura Koch,"I've been using Textea for many years now and love it!! I have an Android and Textra allows me to have group texts with my iPhone friends and family.

You have the ability to stall sending mssgs ability to recall sent texts up to eight or nine seconds afterhitting send. It is a lifesaver! Otherwise some very personal pictures of mine would have gone right out to my boss. Thank you Textra!,5
com.textra,Miles M,"Used for years but searching for alternative. Creepy ad tracking, can only opt out in CA and EU. TEXT MESSAGES should be more private than anything.

com.textra,Dan Dickey,Been using the pro version for years and it's very capable. But if you occasionally try to send a video you'll likely hit a snag. On Verizon the mms limit is 1MB and the app will not compress videos that are too large as native apps iMessage or Samsung Message does. You'll just get a send failure with no explanation.,4
com.textra,Evan Lambert,"Overall good but major design flaw When a text doesn't go through you get no notification that it's failed. I've had this happen and multiple occasions. I texted my wife this morning and they never went through and there is not a single indication that it failed to send other than it doesn't have ""sent"" below the message. If something doesn't send you guys should make it more obvious so people aren't waiting for responses to messages that never went out.",3
com.textra,Kathy Lamm,After continuously having issues with AT&T and Galaxy S22 ultra not sending/receiving messages with stock message apps I read about Textra on Reddit. Downloaded immediately and have not had an issue since. After the trial period I was more than happy to pay the small fee for the ad free version. Works perfectly and runs smoothly.,5
com.textra,Steve Bishop,"Update: Better now. Thanks for fixes.make it so when an iPhone user hits like, it turns the reply into a like on an Android phone of the text that is quoted? Would be nice to have a feature like this. The app could parse the text of the message on Android and look for the word Liked with quotes and then change how the previous message displays with a like icon. Is this going to work now that Google is adding it to their messages app? Also, I can no longer click on web links in my texts anymore.",4
com.textra,Ricardo Barbosa,"It's weird, its the best sms app I've ever tried, then it just stops functioning.

com.textra,K Mohrmann,I've been using this app for a long time without fail. Just recently I have not been able to open up a link directly from the app. I would have to copy the link in the text message and paste it to a web browser. I have no idea how this started happening but is there any fix,4
com.textra,Pacey,"Textra is a great and very customizable messaging app. It was absolutely my go-to for the longest time. The only thing it doesn't have is RCS, then it would be perfect. The moment the app gets this is the moment Textra becomest permanent testing app, as it blows messages and other apps out of the water imo otherwise.",4
com.textra,Art Castner,Love this app...was using pulse sms for 3 years but the recent update caused some issues and they didn't have as much customization as textra.

com.textra,Kerri Cohen,"This is THE ABSOLUTE BEST messaging app EVER! It has so many features that I can't live without now. My favorite being the scheduling feature. I can type a text and schedule it to send on any date at any time I want in the future.

It is so convenient, I never have to worry about forgetting to text someone happy birthday ever again!",5

It would be nice to have an option to turn on notification sounds every time you get a message, regardless.",5
com.textra,Phil Drader,Was super easy to setup. Would give it 5 stars if it had an adjustable reminder interval with a different sound selectable from the original text. My old reminder app had those functions. Also missing some basic functions like being able to select and automatically shrink videos to send.

com.textra,Susan Hastings,"I love this app. My only complaint is when an iPhone user ""likes"" my text, it tells me with a copy of my text back to me.

Hope you add a feature like that in the next update,5

com.textra,Amy Harry,"I really like this app. You can customize the colors on everything and the look and feel which is nice. The one downside is that you can't pinch to increase or decrease the font size. The default Samsung Galaxy app allows you to do that and it's a huge benefit. I would like to see that feature added to this app. Without it, you have to change the font size in the settings which isn't very convenient.",4
com.textra,J R,"Been using it for years now. The only issue I have is that it's annoying to get a new text when someone ""likes"" a message in a group chat. It's unnecessary to get a message saying ""Liked "" whatever the text said"""". Just leave it as a simple thumbs up on that particular message.",4
com.textra,Darryl Doak,Excellent SMS replacement app! Honestly this is one of the best SMS apps I've tried. The fact that Apple won't open up iMessage compatibility cross platform means apps like this have a market. The ability to React to texts with emojis is a great feature as well as changing the emoji theme to match iOS means I can actually see what friends intend to send me. Great job Textra!,5

Now I'm not even getting all my texts! I've been through options up & down nothing makes a difference.... Getting very upsetting & frustrating.,2
com.textra,Robert Lernet,Very good texting app with lot of customization options. My one gripe is that the app time stamp frequency is too slow. Texts are only time-stamped every 15 minutes or so. Time-stamps are important for coversation context as people stop/start within the text thread. Google Messenger time-stamps every text.,4
com.textra,Nicole J,"Still my favorite app of all time. Nothing beats the customization of this app. One of the best out there. I've had this app for years and any problems I've had, I've been able to get taken care of through their support team. If you have issues, email their support team! They respond super fast and are very helpful!",5
com.textra,Liam mc manus,Up until recently I would have given this app a 5 star rating. I paid for premium because I liked it so much but recently it won't mark messages as read when I've seen them. My reason for getting the app was for sending scheduled text messages (which still works as far as I'm aware) . I will be returning to the standard messaging app until this is fixed.,1
com.textra,Suavo Sanchez,"So far, this is an amazing app. I recently had to stop using Signal as my primary SMS service due to discontinued support and was worried I wouldn't be able to find another app that was as customizable and reliable to use. But Textra has it all! It even has support for iMessage BS which (as an android user) has been a perennial annoyance since the early days of emoji support. I was prepared to settle for a mediocre app, marginally better than factory, but thankfully I was blown away instead!",5
com.textra,Josh Dejewski,"Best texting app I have used. (I've tried many). Lots of options on customizing whether thats your chat bubbles or which emojies you use-(apple, android, google). I chose to purchase the upgraded version so I had no ads. You can use it completely fine without purchasing that but I have no regrets with my purchase.",5
com.textra,Jennifer Dillon,"it's smooth. I'm not a power user, just a regular texture, and I've had no issues. easy to send pics and share screen shots. easy to reply and quick reply. I need to get my husband to switch but he's stubborn.",5
com.textra,K Wood,"I have very happily used Textra for years and love the many great features it includes. But recently I have been having issues with some outgoing texts failing, though by no means all. Seems totally random. I can send texts to one contact without an issue, but when I tell sending another, it fails. And sometimes the text sends, even though it still indicates it has failed. So annoying! I have tried sending the same texts through the standard Android messages app without any issue.",5
com.textra,Renee Schut,"A nice detail to choose different colors for your contacts, BUT I can't make calls from the app though my contact list is accurate. Sent texts are not always received, AND I don't always receive texts! Nice trial of 2 months, but I'm looking elsewhere.",3
com.textra,Richard Powers,"I have only used Samsung and Verizon messaging apps. Textra is amazing. Great customization. Android users can use this app to see iPhone emojis on text and you can do the same. I'm not sure of any android apps with this function. The defaults don't do it. So you won't receive the 'tom liked message ""sounds good""' anymore. Other than that no problems. There's other features that Textra had before the default apps Just buy it and make others u know buy it. 😆 I love it",5
com.textra,L B,"Nothing but SIMPLY THE BEST. Google message app does not even come close. Love that SMS auto switches to MMS once SMS reaches its limit with no action required by me. The number of options it offers is mind boggling. You have the option to go PRO to remove adds for the tiniest $amount ever. INSTALL it, you will not be disappointed. I am giving it 10 stars because it is worth it. ********** 💙💚❤️",5
com.textra,Neil W,"I've been using Textra for years and have been very happy. The features to delay sending a text by a few seconds, or to schedule a text to send at a future day/time are the best options in a texting app that I have ever seen.",5
com.textra,Owen Smith,"I really like this app as it's a bit less glitchy than the original Samsung messaging app but it still has some issues like sending messages out of order or messages taking forever to send or just not sending at all sometimes. One of the biggest recent bugs for me is that I'm using an android, and when I use emoji reactions with someone who has an iPhone, they just receive a message saying I ""loved"" their message instead of an actual emoji reaction as they would with another iPhone.",4
com.textra,Mike Ritchey,"Great messaging app! It's customizable with plenty of options and has a nice clean look, including a dark theme. And finally, like iphone messaging, a quick way to ""love"" or ""like"" someone's comment to you without having to make a responce text. Try it… you'll like it!",5
com.textra,Andy Richardson,"Great customer support! Great work on snap back consistency. Wish it worked on pictures/media, but understand. I regularly try other sms apps to make sure what is out there but always come back to Textra. They have been leaders in innovation for years.",5
com.textra,Jerry,"I am ready to pay the few dollars to remove ads. I am a little unhappy that there is no instant add for audio files. I have to find them in my folders, copy and paste, a shortcut would make this app perfect!",4
com.textra,Keri Breese,"Loved this app until I woke up and was notified there is a Trojan software attached to it! Uninstalled the app and reinstalled. Got the same warning about a Trojan from my anti-virus, so it's embedded in the software. After just buying the pro version too. What a waste of money since ill be promptly deleting. Beware!!!",1
com.textra,Lisa Gomez,"This doesn't have achieve folder so I can save verification codes and others from apps that send me important information and codes and things, please fix this problem and respond to this message on your review ASAP! I'm not using the delay anymore because it really doesn't work so that's fine, but I really love this app! It says you responded but I don't see anything on your app review at all!",4
com.textra,ayuxx,I've suddenly started getting a lot of random underlined words and phrases with suggestions to open them in the Google Maps app. The default Messages app doesn't seem to have this problem. Not sure what's changed in the past few days.,3
com.textra,Florin,"My second SIM is disabled in the phone's settings, why do I still get am option to choose between SIM1 and SIM2 right next to the text field? It's annoying and unnecessary! Second, I would like to be able to set my own background image for text messages - is that so difficult to implement?",3
com.textra,Mary Carpenter,"This is the best texting app hands down. Lightning fast, features no other app has, and the most customizable experience I've had with a messaging app probably ever. Which is honestly kinda crazy. Only thing this could do better is connect to imessage somehow",5
com.textra,R H,"UPDATE - Thank You Textra for the rapid response and verification of it as a false positive. I'm pleased to know you have opened a ticket with ESET for review and confirmation of the fp. Major respect for taking such immediate action on this report. Truly impressed! ----------- ESET security has flagged this latest update as a Trojan. Specifically, a TrojanDownloaderAgent.AEN variant. This is absolutely unacceptable. Either ESET has this as a false positive, or Textra has a huge security issue.",5
com.textra,Garrett Acree,"Great texting app, have been using it for a few years now. I like how you can customize the colors of your messages. Also the optional send delay is something I've been grateful for many times! *2022 Edit: THANK YOU FOR UNKNOWN CONTACT NOTIFICATION SILENCING!!! Best new feature ever!!! Textra for life",5
com.textra,Jen Blanton,"i love this app 😍 but I wish it had a way to sort messages by ""unread"" and ""containing media"" so I could more effectively manage my inbox. I'd also like to be able to send audio clips/sound bytes and voice recordings. Please consider these in future updates Thanks!",4
com.textra,Geoff Chr,"I've used this app quite happily for two or three years. Today I needed to forward a phishing SMS but couldn't find any way of doing so. So I wrote to the developer who responded immediately. He explained that the feature was there and how to access it, which was embarrassingly simple!",5
com.textra,michael “cosmosm3” l,fantastic app. very customizable for individual contacts. great visuals. three years later.. still love Textra. updated frequently and now has blocking available. it remains very effective and intuitive with excellent graphics.,5
com.textra,Kay Riojas,"Easy to use, great emojis, able to lock important messages, & send multiple texts. Sometimes, multiple attachments are slow or you do have to resend, but so much better then other text app we've tried. Textra is constantly improving the app!",5
com.textra,Charles Marks,"PROBLEM??? New Phone (Google Pixel 7, Android 12) - unable to change the notification sound for the app to anything other than the system default. The others all appear but play no sound if selected. Is this a new issue? I have paid version and have added/removed the app too.",4
com.textra,Janet Miller,I have been using Textra for a couple of years. My favorite feature is to be able to send 'Chat' or 'Bulk' texts. Chat meaning all people on text get the responses. Bulk meaning responses only come to me. Really good and helpful app.,5
com.textra,Jeff Horne,"Unlike other SMS apps I have used, this doesn't allow me to set the swipe direction to delete. It also requires a swipe and two taps. These should be customizable. Other than that, I like it so far.",4
com.textra,Klaudia Michelle,Better than the stock message app! Customer service is quick in responding. Being able to delay a text from sending by a few seconds is a great feature... Every time they have an upgrade date had something new.,3
com.textra,Jennifer Crisman,I love the simplicity and colorfulness of Textra! I've been using the app for years. The only suggestion I have is to make it so you can mark a message unread again after reading if you don't want to forget to check on it again.,5
com.textra,A Google user,"I have been a Textra user for as long as Textra has been Textra, I love Textra, I have NEVER experienced any issues with the app it's always been reliable, very customizable, all I can say is if you want the best then look no further Textra is the best Messaging app you can get, Spend the few bucks and go pro you'll be happy you did, I'm a Textra user for life",5
com.textra,L A,It's not working properly won't send videos (always some issue with this) but won't allow the video to be opened. This app has always been bad about sending any video I often have to use a different messaging app,1

com.textra,Mike A,Best texting app I've ever used. Very customizable. The only thing I would like to see is when you do a schedule message is being able to set a repeat message for every day / week or month.,5
com.textra,Daniel D Kitteringham,"TROJAN ALERT I have both ESET Mobile Security and Textra on my phone for a few years. Textra has been on a few years longer with other antivirus apps installed with it. Never did ESET or any other antivirus app flag Textra for anything, until today. ESET flagged Textra with android/trojandownloader.agent.aen. That means Textra has been infected or injected with an auto malware downloader. Users need to install and run an anti virus scan ASAP. This has been reported to Google.",1
com.textra,Dave “Dr Dave” Kirkpatrick,All the slick features mean nothing since this app is one hack away from your phone being pwnd - there's no way to disable / block mms except by first blocking the sender. So this means that any unknown sender just needs to send an image containing malware and your phone is owned.,1
com.textra,Lezli Klitzke,my other message app kept failing. This is much better although it will fail to send a message now and then I at least get a notice and can resend it right there. I would like to be able to customize more than what's there but it's good.,4
com.textra,Shaun Phillips,Have used textra (paid version) for a few years now and it's brilliant. So much so I don't even think about it. I'm a business user with a decade of sms and its still lightning fast. It just works with no messing around!,5
com.textra,Jacob Huempfner (JaykeBird),"A lot of features and customization options, allowing me to have precisely the text messaging experience I want. Really awesome app overall, and I have very few complaints.",5

com.textra,William Bundy,Only using for about 3 hours but it does what I want it to do that Google & Samsung messages does not do and that is when multiple pictures are sent you can delete them separately without deleting others. Would be nice to have a trash like Samsung.,5
com.textra,Melissa Malatesta,*They reached out and had me email and walked me through fixing my problem* I'm really loving this because my last text stopped giving me delivery notifications after their latest update. I like the customization with this app and though it could have more it's still nice. My only complaint and what I REALLY hate is that I can't have my floating bubbles/chats anymore. I loved that because I have a few people that I text all day pretty much and I hate that I can't have their icon anymore.,5
com.textra,Holly Zlotopolski,I prefer using Textra over the messaging app that comes on any of my phones. I have been able to copy and send entire conversations to my email address to save for later use I think that's my favorite attribute that texture offers,5

com.textra,Sean Jackson,So far so good. If they had a private box they would get 5 stars.....update 9/24/22 I'm getting some of my text messages 6-12 hours later. This is no good and needs to be addressed. Dropped my rating from 4 to 2 stars. Please fix. *Update 10/20/22......messages are coming through regularly again.,5
com.textra,S Davi,"I find the app is very good, good enough to be my default mail app, and good enough to have paid for the PRO version. There are improvements needed to be 5 🌟. a) ability to archive b) ability to search either archives or non-archived individually c) ability to search within one conversation (on this I was told by the developer I could limit the search to a specific conversation by putting the contact name [or group] into the search field - and yes it works nicely)",4

com.textra,Jordanray7049,"I have used Textra for going on 6 years now. I wouldn't use any other app. The only reason it gets 4 stars (and in fact the only reason I'm giving a review) is as of late, it won't send pictures. I'm sure this will only be a temporary problem. I suggest this app to anyone!",4
com.textra,Universal Mycelium,Best text messages app I ever used. Has everything I ever wanted in a text message app. Beautiful.

com.textra,Natanya O'Brien,"Best messaging app I've used. The customization is perfect along with how easy it is to send and recieve messages. It does come with a few bugs though. Integration with other messaging apps is almost nonexistent, especially with reaction messages other people use. You will often recieved a message saying ""[Name] liked your message [insert entire message]."" There's also issues with texting large messages. The text box increases, making seeing the active chat a challenge.",4
com.textra,Josef H.,"The app's features are brilliant, the app itself doesn't work properly. Some messages are never received when Textra is set as the default messaging app. It simply isn't reliable. I had to switch back to Google messages. Also, deleting a message takes an unnecessary number of steps! You have to 1. swipe, 2. tap, 3. tap to confirm. That's just ridiculous.",1
com.textra,ariel hantom,"Was indeed a network transition delay. Love the app, its reliable, I'm receiving all. Couple of small things could do with a tweak for efficiency but nothing dramatic, soo small i dont even remember what they are till i try doing them lol.

Still to figure out if i actually need wifi or data to run the app 😂 probs not if it's to replace preinstalled.",5
com.textra,Dave Townsend,"I've been using this app for a while and just love its functionality,and ease of use. I especially like the group text options.

Wish there was an auto reply feature when I'm driving, but no big deal....",5

I've gone to my Pixel 6 settings and selected ""Silent"" for incoming Textra messages, but when my phone isn't on silent, then Textra will still vibrate/ring. I want phone calls to ring at night, but I don't want Textra to ring. If someone could help me figure out how to silence Textra notifications either on the app or on Pixel 6 settings, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!",5
com.textra,Onno van Santen,Very nice app. I would bump it to a 5 star of I did not have the unfortunate occasional creating of a group message they is send from a spontaneous group pulled from unrelated contacts. I emailed you about this issue and I hope you get this bug fixed. No response on my request.....thanks I've bought it as I was happy with it overall - can you STOP your program from sending me requests for reviews?! I shall have to start bumping further stars as my expression of frustration with this practice,3

com.textra,Contaminated312,Textra has been a long time favorite SMS app of my which constantly gets improved. Would like to make a suggestion for developers to include a method to filter out unknown numbers that text you (like a spam or junk folder).,5
com.textra,BR D,Works good and does post dated messages. A few additions that would be good. 1) Adding or removing a person to an existing group. 2) having the option of having a picture for the background.,5
com.textra,Hanno TallBear,i love the ability to change the colors of the interface and the text bubbles. the emojis are great. secure. no issues at all.,5
com.textra,Nikki Iedema,The paid version is a good deal. It is not expensive. I like no ads and the fact I can respond to text messages with a love icon without having to go out and buy an iPhone.,5
com.textra,Somebody's Account,"Great texting app, works great, many customization features, but not overwhelming. Ad-Free is kinda pricey, but I think the devs deserve some money so... Eh Could also use RCS features added to keep the functionality on par with stock messenger apps",4
com.textra,Michael Austin,"This is almost the best text app on the market but unfortunately it is not compatible with the Samsung Watch. Once the developer update the app it will be perfect. Hopefully, it will be updated soon.",1
com.textra,Lain Abbott,It is a pleasure to open and use Texta. It is an elegant simple program that allows one to tailor it according to one's needs and purpose. Never has it glitched.,5
com.textra,Panayoti Kokalis,So far seems good. Moved here because pulse moved downhill unfortunately. Hope they allow for you to message from your computer one day and also for them to know when someone read your message.,4
com.textra,Mark Giardina,The app is really good. Lots of customizing and such. My only issue is that my phone just finished installing the new update for android and suddenly i lost my pro status?,5
com.textra,Matt L,"Been using this app for several years, no way I'd go back to the stock garbage app. This app is so good, it should be the default on all android phones!!!",4
com.textra,A,"It's great for customization but it keeps showing messages as being unread even though I've read them & even tapped on ""mark all as read."" They'll mark as read, but next time I go into the app more msgs will be ""unread."" This has been a problem for years and I'm not sure it will ever be resolved. I tried to help the devs troubleshoot back in like 2019 but I guess it's not a fixable issue on Google Pixel phones. These phones are kinda garbage so I bet it's a Google problem.",4
com.textra,Justin Benn,"Been using this for some years now. Have carried it across numerous Android phones. A mature, well-featured. Eset antivirus is throwing up a false positive for the app (November '22). Hopefully this will be resolved soon.",5
com.textra,Mike T,I've been using textra for years and it's great. Feature rich without being bloated. It's intuitive and user friendly and has everything I want.,5
com.textra,scott tighe,Sadly uncustomizable. Display only 5 messsages because font and spacing is so big and wasteful. Probably good for big tablet where space is available. Not useful for phone.,1
com.textra,Jake,"My favorite texting app for years now, but it does not have split view/dual column support for Z Fold phones. It'd go back to my default if it gains that functionality",4
com.textra,Shauna M,I've been using for years because the native app on Samsung is so ugly. Had a problem and they were very fast to respond with a solution to my emojis not working correctly. Think I'll upgrade.,5
com.textra,Mark Ware,"I have tried a lot of messaging apps and so far, this is the best. Different themes and interfacing with Apple (I have Samsung) is better than anything I have seen. Recommend.",5
com.textra,Aaron Zifovich,Came back after a long while. Everything is improved except notification vibrations are too long. 2 SMS in a row and it feels like someone is calling.,4
com.textra,Thomas M.,I have been using Textra since the very beginning. All of a sudden my pro version is gone. Support has no record of my purchase. Not happy. Google billing only going back to 2019. How do I show proof then.,1

com.textra,Tamra Parker,"I love the ways in which you can customize Textra. The functionality is also really good. It has everything the other apps have, and more.",5
com.textra,Schuyler Ryan,"fixed an issue for me that persisted across multiple phones where group SMS was really buggy if there were any apple users in the group (this is Apple's fault for intentionally not confirming to a standard text communication protocol). regardless of fault, textra makes the group chats work as expected which is really nice",5
com.textra,Avnesh Verma,"I am using this app since last 6 months and really now i am fan of this nice app but there is one important thing is missing. If we could get category feature for texts like personal, promotional, finance...etc than this app will perfect in every aspect. So i just request plz add category features in textra.",4
com.textra,adrinp,Enjoy this message app better than many others I tried so i went to Pro. Would like to see the ability to search for a key word in the history of a conversation.,4
com.textra,Frank Schmitt,I use Android.I had been put on random group texts of people I do not even know. Android has no system by which to easily block these. Textra DOES. And it is easy to use. It is all I use for messaging now.,5

com.textra,Leasa P,"4.5/5 - I love this app, the KEEP update is nice BUT I wish there was a way you could mark a text as unread so if I don't have time to respond when I see it I can mark it and go back later. Add that, you get 5 stars.",4
com.textra,SKOOKUMUNGA,"This app just keeps getting better.....Now a feature called ""Keep"".... No more sending myself texts....How dope is that?! I have a Ham Radio smartphone which is a pain in the A$$ and this is the only app that works well with an Alps RFINDER",5

com.textra,Russell Fryman,"I've been a pro user for many years. I can't recommend this enough. Buy the pro version, you won't be disappointed. Question though: is rcs messaging on the development calendar?",5
com.textra,Swimming Pools,I would like to buy the pro version but nothing happens when I tap on the button to buy it. App works perfect though.,4

com.textra,Dually 3500 (Dually 3500),"So i still like your app until i had to reset my phone,and now im not getting texts or not very many,so i had to stop using it,i did like all the features tho when it worked for me.",3

Seems to be a documented issue with others so it might be a miui issue. Also some people have reported a fix if you set textra to autostart in app settings but for now I've gone back to Google messages as my sms app. Thanks, been in contact with carrier for weeks trying fixes but it's not carrier related. Even tried new sim!",2
com.textra,Kenny Sanders,So far so great ! Replaced Google messages with this after doing my research and have to say I really glad I came over to Textra ! Can't wait for more updates and improvements!!,5
com.textra,Daniel Seibert,I have tried other texting apps and they work okay. Textra was suggested by a T-Mobile Tech and does eveerything I need to block spammers and getting the messages out to those I text. excellent messaging app.,5
com.textra,Jonathan L,"The best Android text app available, hands down. I started using Textra in May of 2017 and they are still adding new features to keep up with user requests.

com.textra,Efuru Patterson,"I LOVE this app! I've been using this app for a few years and it just keeps getting better and better! This app gives you features that the BIG companies are waving at you as some ""perk"" it's likely,Textra has implemented it ready.I recommend them to everyone.",4
com.textra,Misha Ketslah,"Ffs, I have paid version and you dare to put popup ads 🤦‍♂️ Edit: to be clear it was not SMS, as it is not in the list of incoming ones, it was popup that stays open and has ""Save"" button.",1
com.textra,Missy Chandler,Great app! Gets better with every update. Has some great features on it.Easy to use.No snags. Better than app that comes with phone.Love it.Wouldn't use anything else.,5
com.textra,Samii Ann B,"Responce....,..Yes it is the app n not my carrier as my built in sms app and other apps worked immediately.

Its the only app i can find that let me react to msgs and now i cant use it.",1
com.textra,Joshua Cronin,"Alright, look. There's been quite a few incidents where I do not receive texts. This happens a lot when I'm connected to a wifi network. I need this fixed or I'll be forced to leave this app.",1
com.textra,Neko Crafter,"Been using it and a fan for a while, but I have a major issue with group texts. My carries does support them, and the issue solely exists in Textra, after a brief bit my messages will stop sending, and I'll stop receiving any, this happens on data and wifi, and takes 10-20 minutes for the message to display ""Can't get MMS timeout"" and I'll finally get messages again. This happens every 2-5 minutes of texting and is ridiculous. Restarting Phone and clearing cache doesn't help",1
com.textra,Shirley Smajd,"This was recommended to me, and while it does have lots of really nice features, unfortunately there are no auto reply or driving mode functions. I use those functions daily, so the need for them outweighs all the other features of the app, so unfortunately I have to uninstall and revert back to my previous app.",4
com.textra,Carly Weems,"I've used Textra for years, but suddenly this week my pictures are continually failing to send. I get ""Can't get MMS"" messages constantly.

com.textra,Sam P,"Can't send videos, have to use the native app. It was working last week... Don't blame my phone, don't blame my file (it sent fine last week), don't blame me. It's your app. There are no network issues here.",2
com.textra,Wes Patton,Search within conversation would be a good addition. Media sorted by type as well. Seems like progress was made this year though.,3
com.textra,JeoueX Cult,I paid the full version before but got ads again after update. Waste of money. Edit: Ofcourse there is a need to rate you 1 star. You're not doing a great job if people are losing licenses. Think people!,1
com.textra,E. Tan,"Fully customizable down to the keyboard, font size and color scheme. Been using for several years now without issues. Best sms app for me!",5

com.textra,Gerard,"My Google Pixel texting started acting funky, to the point it took minutes to send/receive, heated my phone and drained the battery. Contacting Google was fruitless. So I tried Textra and LOVE it. My phone is again working like new. I suggest Google buys Textra as it's dependable, super fast and easy to use. And their customer service is excellent! 5 STARS!",5
com.textra,Joe Wylliams,have been using the pro version for a long time now and it's the best messenger out here. My only problem is one. Sometimes messages fail to show due to android's ability to block running applications when the screen is turned off. I have disabled batter optimization and other settings to make it run smoothly but android 7 and above seems to override Textra SMS. I hope you can find a way in which it can be a device admin app if other settings fail. It's my all time favourite SMS app.,5
com.textra,Melissa Mack,"I really really love this app, I just wish it had that thing where you can see if someone has read your message when you send someone a text, but other than that, the app is great & it is beautiful!",4
com.textra,Michael Pangburn,Will not let me send photos from my gallery to groups. Update: i was promptly contacted by Textra and was able to resolve the issue! (You must explicitly enable permissions and reboot),5
com.textra,DanielandTerri Spilde,I have been using this app for about 5 years I really like the personalization that can be done I like how it notifies you of text messages coming in I like how it lets you view send pictures everything that you would want to do in a text app. To the builders of this app Would you consider adding an option to post your data to an external SD card instead of the internal phone memory?,5
com.textra,Chris Nelson,"This app is fast, easy to use, and has the features I wanted. It has served me well for the last 7 years as a paid user... Until it didn't. Before today, this was a 5 star app. However, today when opening a conversation, the app crashed and i lost an entire text conversation of 3 years. I hope Textra fixes this issue.",3

com.textra,Matthew Giannone,I have been using textra for many years with the premium version. I can't say enough good things about the app. But its last update is completely crippling my device. Crashes when opening front camera or even the menu that allows it. Please help?,5
com.textra,Stu Bowden,Full featured SMS & MMS client for Android. I love this app. You can set customised tones and colours for each conversation and schedule messages to be sent later. Requested features: -- archive stale conversations older than x months so they can be internally compressed and out of view -- when a message is scheduled can another message be allowed to be sent to the same conversion? Sometimes I'd like to send a quick reply to an incoming message and keep the scheduled message in place. Thanks!,5
com.textra,G,"Absolutely the best customization app for text, unfortunately l had to get rid of it. It was turning on permissions by itself, and in the years I've used it, it never did that.!!",5
com.textra,Ulric Ogle,"Three stars because the call function needs improvement. Calls fail to connect or other party cannot hear me. Messages take up to 8 hrs to be delivered at times.

com.textra,Melissa Troy,"I want to love this app, but my main contact with thousands of messages disappears. Then a day or 2 later reappears with only a few messages. What's missing is quick texts, categories for important messages from spam, and backup & restore. If the these were fixed and/or implemented I would love it and keep it.",2
com.textra,yeh (yeh),"It wouldn't surprise me if I've been using this app for over a decade. It's constantly giving me what I've wanted out of a messeging app. Customization is why I love Android and Textra adds to that. They've added tap back reactions, which I love. Hoping they add the read receipts since that's been added to Samsung messaging app.",5
com.textra,J Shade,How to eliminate KEEP? It should be an option and not a forced destination that replaces one of the lines on quick share/message.,3
com.textra,Paolina Guerrier,"It's a pretty great app so far. I do appreciate how customizable it is and that MMS isn't an annoying hassle for me. The only thing I would love to see is a Category feature, so I can organize my family, friends, colleagues, etc., so it wouldn't be cluttered and hard to find messages.",3

I'm very funny about my text messages and the way they look. Also I have never had any issues with them. Love this messaging app. Hated when Google made them stop using colored notification lights. Absolutely loved that feature. Still hands down the simplest best messaging app.,5
com.textra,Kacey C,"I love this texting app! I am currently using the free version so I see ads but I am considering paying for it, which I never do, just because I think it is such a well-designed app. the ads are placed according to where you want them which I think is a very thoughtful thing to do for non-paying customers. it is that thoughtfulness that makes me want to pay for it. Great job developers!",5
com.textra,J Erickson,"(4yrs later): BEST text app from the many, many I've tried! (test others regularly: textra always wins!) Upgraded to Pro a few yrs ago for 1 time few bucks. Free version definitely full feature.

Developer regularly updates, welcomes suggestions & actually responds to questions/concerns. THANK YOU!",5

Descriptively, for it to receive text messages, it requires only that I open it and in it directly. If I close it, I cannot receive any message, so please do something about it.

I'd easily give this app 100 stars if it worked with my Samsung 5 Pro watch. Unfortunately, it doesn't, so I have to switch back to the stock app on my phone as well as on the watch. I'm so sad, because the Textra Android app is WONDERFUL as a stand-alone phone app. I'm sure I'll be able to give 5 stars as soon as a watch app is available.",4

com.textra,Greg Nakagawa,"Until recently I would say it's been a 5* app - but for about a month now, no audible notification sound, only vibrate - despite ALL settings in Android and Textra showing there should be sound. I have seen other users are experiencing the same, someone said since 2.51 update on 7/20,which is about when both my wife and I started noticing it. Galaxy s22+ and s22 Ultra. Obviously a text app without sound is pretty worthless.",2

com.textra,Jack Lynn,"Crashes a lot, days textra is not responding. Doesn't always receive messages. I get picture text messages about 1 hour after they are sent super annoying in the group message.

Never had a problem until recently, every other text is being flagged as not sent even though the recipient is receiving the message. Then the app tries re-sending the message or picture and it sends it twice. Very frustrating to get a notification after every text I send that my message failed to send. I dont know if it was a recent update that has caused the issue, but its getting worse. Before this all started the app was great.",5
com.textra,Matt Chenard,Ya it used to be good but it seems the MMS quality has dropped considerably. 2 stars cuz it's still probably better than the Google msgs but I'm looking for an alternative again,2
com.textra,Jonathon Mitchell (DevilHunter1337),"Update: After upgrading to a new phone, I can confirm that Google backup does work. > I really like this app. All the features it provides is neat. This app deserves to be on top.",5
com.textra,Sheretta Karismadatruf “Karisma-ohgirl!” Drinkwater,"Textra is absolutely great!! I have been using this app over 5 years now, and I've never had a problem the 1st problem that I had tonight or this morning I should say at 12:26 a.m.cst. I email customer care and they responded immediately, no complaints here!!!",5
com.textra,Mike Streeter,"MMS has stopped working, checked apn, checked settings, cleared cache, restarted 5 times. No love. Moved back to Messages unfortunately 😕",2
com.textra,Stueee P,I Ioved using it but will have to switch to Samsung messages after getting galaxy watch 4 as the notifications don't pop up on the watch.,3
com.textra,England Simpson,"More often than not, Textra will experience issues with file sharing (especially photos).",4
com.textra,Jessica Allgeyer,Downgraded my rating since they removed the icon I was using for notifications. And removed vibrations patterns. Why?! Bring them back! Please bring back custom vibrations.,3
com.textra,G Singh,"Best app. Can be Customise. One can send voice message too. Copy of text word by word in my stock app was not possible, but Textra did this job. Many more functions. In 2021 I changed my handset, which is Android one. Textra goes into heibernation, so unable to receive SMS. Feeling bad, so uninstalled.",5
com.textra,Hayes Leung,"Great and simple app. Used it for a long time now, since 2016. Only wish they could add a function to display all unread messages with a button instead of scrolling through the list of messages. If you dislike ads, it's great to donate and support developers as it is a one time donation.",4
com.textra,Mohammed Zaheer Khan,It's quite super and supreme application for text messages. I had using this application for a long time. It's an excellent and great application which I have been with it. Good luck and warm regards to all the team members of textra SMS. 😍😍😍😍😍♥♥♥♥♥,5
com.textra,Valerie McBee,It's a great app. My only suggestion would be to add bitmoji as option when we send a message. Also stickers woukd be great. The texting app that comes with Samsung has it.,4
com.textra,Jack Unger,Had a strange optimizing / syncing problem. It took only 2 emails for Max to fix it. Great support and great app. Thank you.,5
com.textra,Keara Appel,"I can't respond to automated texts. I've tried every solution I could find, but still can't do it. It's a mild inconvenience, but annoying enough for me to look for a new app.",3
com.textra,Mike Thayer,"I've tried many texting apps, but I always came back to Textra. There are so many options to customize it. I'm not even looking at other apps anymore.",5
com.textra,Joseph Ghamaa,"The App is great and amazing. Once I had the challenge of getting notifications, but the problem has been solved! Bravo! Now I rate it 5 ✨",5
com.textra,Luuna Quinn,It looks great and works great but the fact that this app has no archiving feature is a significant downgrade. Even the default text app has that.,4

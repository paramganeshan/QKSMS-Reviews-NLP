com.p1.chompsms,David Karr,"I've been using chomp on my Galaxy note 9 for quite a while. I have custom sound notifications set at the top level, and for several specific numbers. As of a couple of weeks ago, the sounds stopped working. Curiously, the same thing happened with Whatsapp at the same time. However, the Samsung messages app works fine. In both the chomp and whatsapp settings, I can verify what sound I have configured and hear it, but when a message arrives, it only vibrates. I have tried rebooting.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jill Cowan,"I have been using this app for years, like since the beginning and have loved it and never wanted anything else. When the Android 13 update rolled out, it really messed up this app. My phone no longer lights up when I get a text, which is a real problem. I depend on that setting. This app needs a serious update to catch up to Android 13! Please fix ASAP!!! My phone is lagging and half the time the app freezes and I can't even open it!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Stephanie J,"I absolutely love this app. Very easy to use and does so much more then the basic sms app on my phone. I love the delayed send option, it's great for reminders to friends. I have to say I used the free version for about 2 hours and then purchased the paid version. Not because of ads or anything like that, instead, I wanted to support a great product and this is a great product Edit 11/28/22 I've been using chomp for two years now and I still love it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Mike R,"The option to change the notification sound needs to be more easily accessible. It's pretty tucked away and kind of hard to find. The same with changing the fonts. The app scans for fonts and shows you what applications there are, but to actually change it means you got to go into the conversation view scroll down to outgoing messages and then see the fonts there. If the option to scan for font is easily to find, then the option to change them should just be included right there.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Virginia Mayberry,"I've been using Chomp for several years and I love it. However, I'm starting to get mass spam texts that have multiple other phone numbers attached to it, and there is no option to add the original sender to the block list. If you were able to add the block list to the menu, after long pressing the contact info from the chat bubble, it would be super!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Kayla W.,"An amazing SMS app. The options to customize the aesthetic elements are simple yet thorough, and the ads are completely non-invasive. Literally my only gripe is that the message notifications take up half the screen, but it's an incredibly small price to pay. Speaking of small prices, the one time payment for ad-free experience + extra themes is literally $5 plus tax. Totally affordable if you ever have any extra spending money, and yet not necessary to improve your experience! I love this app!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Derik Arendall,"Only issue I've really encountered that I can think of is sometimes the text notification block doesn't go away after opening it, and will need swiping away in the phones notifications list before it really goes away. Aside from that, it's a great app with a great breadth of customization options perfect for anyone that wants to play with different aesthetics to their texting UI",4
com.p1.chompsms,R honda D,"I love the features but for some reason or another my messages are not being sent or received at times. Then all of a sudden I get them all at once. This just started happening about 2 weeks ago. Any suggestions. Other than this hiccup, this app is amazing! Update: per chomp, this is as a Samsung update issue. Reset network settings under general management.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Melissa Gurney,Been using about a year and it was easy to set up and pretty intuitive except for being able to voice text haven't been able to figure out. Another bummer is you can't send videos. I've tried sending 3 second videos get an error message doesn't support. Other than that great app!,5
com.p1.chompsms,KENNETH MCGHEE,"I have used chomp on a daily basis for the last 5 years and I find it to be much more feature rich than the messenger apps preinstalled on my Samsung and iphone. Besides Chomp having more customization, the ability to schedule text for delivery the followng day is a game changer for me (are you listening Apple). Also I love how easy it is to backup & restore previous messages.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jayden W.,"A finicky experience. #1 there isn't even an app-wide dark mode. #2 I have to manually select delete multiple in the 3 dots menu, very inconvenient and slow. #3 very slow... Overall not looking too great. Either the developers have odd preferences or not enough effort is being put into the design.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Brandi Darlas,"I usually use textra, but currently it's having some issues. Wrote a review on it. Switched to chomp for now. Issues found: #1 unread dot isn't staying the color you set it. Reverts back to it's original color before you can save. #2 When in settings it still has the original white/green background, it doesn't take on the theme that is set. Not sure if it's a Glitch, but the white is hard on the eyes. Dark mode is best. Even a light gray would be better. Please consider fixing... Thank you.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Rob S,"It would really help if you LOST THE ADS. No one wants to see a fake message from Ashley furniture pop up on the message list. I sincerely doubt anyone is actually clicking the link anyway. I also don't like the group text or picture message functions. In group text, there is no way to send individual messages; they either go to everyone at once or not at all. Also whenever you get a picture message, the app doesn't work. You don't get a pop-up notice, it's like the app doesn't know what to do.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Natural Nashuan,Excellent. The ads aren't intrusive and actually interesting. It's better than the Google texting app that came with the lhone because it allows single texts to be deleted without deleting the entire conversation. Easy to use for sending photos though writing space is limited. I haven't had any trouble with it at all. Three years later I'm still pleased in 2022,5
com.p1.chompsms,Ian Icecaster,"It freezes up every so often and asks if ya wanna close it or wait. I like the app, and it's by far above and beyond the other apps, but still it has issues. I typed a LONG MESSAGE to my girl, and it refused to send it in an SMS or MMS version, so I had to take a screen shot of every paragraph and sent the images to her, for her to read the entire text. I'm shopping for a new app, but using this one because I paid for it and when I find something better than this, I'll dump this and move on.",2
com.p1.chompsms,LADY. S,"I've been using Chomps for over 10 years I've never had any issues, but for some reason, I've been having some major software problems with this app. I can't delete none of my messages through the app. I uninstalled it then deleted the message on my original app then I reinstalled chomps the messages were still there! I really like this app because of the ""signature feature"" but I think I'm a have to look for another messaging app until chomps fix the issue.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Allendefullism kin s s hi,"It works fine. The default samsung texting app requires you to press ""view more"" on longer texts, which I was not having, and while using google's texting app I repeatedly had texts sent to me that I never received. I have had one pretty major problem with Chomp. This review only allows 500 characters, so to cut it short: i was not getting popup notifications from chomp for over a year, eventually I discovered I had to go into my phone's settings and like 10 screensinfoundtheoptiontoenablethem",5
com.p1.chompsms,Layne Erdman,"So chomp wanted me to update my review, I've been using it a few years because tmobiles text app was terrible. Chomp is a good basic app. Kind of no frills, no fun stuff like Verizon gives you regularly with emojis etc. But stable and reliable, what I miss most from other platforms is search capability. you can't search a particular conversation or search just photos. it's very limited but it does the job.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Private Party,I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because: 1. The font size is small and you can't change it; 2. I couldn't find the Block Sender option But I did finally find the feature to lock a message or image - it comes on after you select the image or text and another menu appears with things not listed immediately under its Settings.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Jackie Kidwell,"I needed to find an app due to my msg app on my phone no longer made group text possible. Responses came back not within the group. CHOMP was the second download I tried. Works flawlessly. Not only for groups. After about a week very small adds appear at the top, but they are not intrusive. One thing I do wish the app would do is to be able to sort contacts into categories such as favorites, business, clients, etc. For now you can pin your favorites to the top of the list. Thank you Chomp.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Randy Borow,"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra here. For the last few years this was my favorite SMS text messaging app. Unfortunately, that changed about 2 months ago. For some inexplicable reason, none of my outgoing messages using Chomp are received. I myself can receive messages, but when I send messages, none of my recipients get them. On my end it LOOKS like they were delivered, but none are. I've tried every fix there is, but nothing works. I simply cannot use Chomp anymore.",1
com.p1.chompsms,MoonMuk,I used to love this app. Used it for years. It's the best customization app for sms. But it recently messed my whole life up because I was not receiving important texts and it wasn't sending half my texts and I had no idea. Now I can send ten one word texts in a row to a phone and the person wont get a single text and it doesn't even say error. So I can't use this app anymore and I don't think I could trust it ever again. :(,1
com.p1.chompsms,Pamela Holmes,Great texting app Love the various colors and backgrounds that you can download. One of the few apps that allows you to have a signature at the end of your message. Also love that I can send group text. My previously messaging app was causing issues. I also like the ease if use.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Phil Loyd,"As a trucker, I could really use a voice recording feature. The ability to send and receive voice texts, rather than pulling over so often really is a big deal. An app that I previously had would do that. It allowed for up to 60 seconds of voice recording time. Please add this type of feature, and I will gladly up the rating to 5 stars. Everything else seems fine. Thanks",2
com.p1.chompsms,Jaye Eryk,"Every time I customize for my own ringtone or use a different theme, I lose the most critical points of a text app. I get ZERO notifications! After a couple of days of it working normally. I get NO audio alert when a text comes in, NOR do I get ANY sort of notification whatsoever. I have absolutely no clue I ever get a text which renders this app completely useless and uncustomizable! However, if I leave it alone, which I hate, it works fine.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Overall excellent messaging experience. The extent to which one can customize that experience is great, and this opportunity contributes greatly to the feel of the app. The only issue is the ads. While mostly unintrusive, if the app loads late it may push down a conversation that you were just about to click on, causing you to click the ad. This is but an infrequent, minor, and avoidable problem. However, I wish there were options for customizing the size and shape of the quick-reply popup.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Natasha Prentice,"Great app. The ads aren't invasive at all. Wish I could personalize the message alert tone for each of my contacts, but other than that, it's a great app * Replying, I did as recommended, but the screen shows white and at the bottom, the options to save or cancel. When I choose save, a message flashes telling me to enter info to save. It's not working.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I was looking for a new app to send messages and photos because the app that came with my android phone stopped sending photos, and I found Chomp. So far it has been working great, and after downloading 2 extra accesories I customized it to look fun, not necessary but I love having the option. The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the ads that I keep clicking on accidentaly, a bit annoying when you're in a hurry, but hey, nothing's free in this world!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Chomp is useful and dependable. Does about everything I need a text/SMS to do. There are a couple minor annoyances, as far as i can see. If I have an established group chat and want to add a new person, i have to create a new group. would rather be able to just add one to existing group. there is no warning if a picture is too large, or if it's because there is text as well, but some things fail to send, which may not be apparent until much later when I open it again. resend won't fix it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like it very much. I can control it so that it's visually easiest for me to read and write texts. The advertisements are annoying in a way that all advertisements are annoying. After a little bit of time using it though, if you wait a sec and don't accidentally fall for the trap of tapping on the top message, which is actually the ad but resembles a message, you'll likely be able to skip even glimpsing the subliminal message and not clicking on it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Great app! I've been using another app for the last 4 years and I've changed to this one. The ability to customize is incredible. The only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 are: 1. There is no draft indication. If you have to leave the app in the middle of a message and then return there is no indication of a draft message. 2. No ability to create multiple signatures. Should be able to create different signatures for different contacts. Otherwise a great app!,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"So far, less than thirty minutes of having it downloaded, it works better than a previous texting app I had. Pictures actually send. I kinda want to buy the full version, but one bad review of it hurt my chances. This is worse for me because my phone is an original Chinese version and I like the way it works right now, but don't want the ads and don't want how it works to change. I would like to be able to put different themes on each conversation though, to tell which is which easier.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Diane Smith,"Having issues...First off, I love the way your app allows us to customize the look of the app. Two issues I'm having: 1. I don't receive a pop up when I get a new text, just a little icon on the task bar on the top of the phone which is easily missed 2. Once I add a picture to a message, I can't look at the pic any more. I press on it to enlarge it and nothing happens. Even after I send the text, it won't allow me to see the pic except for the little thumbnail.",3
com.p1.chompsms,John McFarland,"Google message that comes standard on all phones is horrible. If you get ""message expired or unavailable"" then you need to download this App. I tried all the fixes for Google messages, and none worked. Chomp is great and works great. When I downloaded this app, I went into settings and made it the default app for messages and all my contacts and messages were loaded up. After about 30 days, they start showing ads, but it is just a bar at the top. No big deal. Thanks Chomp for an app that works!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love this app, used it for years since having a smartphone. My only complaint is that there isn't an easy way to clean up the conversations list. I get tons of spam texts and if I want to delete or blacklist those texts, I have to do it one at a time. Multiple blacklist and multiple delete options would be a fantastic asset to this app. EDIT: didn't know about the multi delete in the settings. I still think a multi blacklist would be useful as well. Thanks!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Nicholas Thieme,"My default texting app wasn't sending texts to my wife for some reason. I could receive them and everyone else got my outgoing, but not her. This app did the trick. I love the customization options too. I now have a dark color scheme that's much easier on the eyes. The only thing missing so far, is the ability to mark messages as ""read"" from the notification pop-up. Not a huge deal, but a minor convenience I miss.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Shows something different than what is sent. If I send a picture, it'll show a completely different picture. Same goes for text messages. It doesn't always do it. It's very irregular. I can go into the standard messaging app and never have any issues. All issues I had have been resolved with help from Chomp SMS support team. I've updated to a 5 star rating.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is really a great SMS app. I am currently using Textra and this is a definite competitor for my go to SMS app.  Just a couple of reasons why, I probably won't switch to Chomp.  1.  When viewing the list or message, the placement for a photo is a random ugly color that I cannot seem to change.  Is there a way to change this?  2. When I find a color that I like for the top bar, I want to be able to match that color all the way around, just like in Textra. It makes it very difficult to find the exact color over and over again.  Aside from that, this program has come a long way.  Thank you for resolving this for me.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Rob Perschau,"I like this app. It's clean, reliable and simple while still offering all the features I've ever wanted. I have my groups, my various notifications and my history. Speech to text works very well. Pick your color scheme and numerous other customizations. Customer service has been very responsive. Slight hitch when you take a picture from within the app and attach it to a message. It frequently will not send until you back up and reload the saved message. Not enough for me to change my rating.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Robin,"I only started using this app yesterday, but I already love it. However, I REALLY wish there was a way to split the profile pictures in group texts, to show each recipient's pic. For example, a group text with four people just shows ""4"" as the profile pic. This is not helpful if you have several group texts with different recipients. The recipients' names don't all show in the header, so you have to click each text to see if it's the one you want. Five stars if I can get this resolved!",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Mostly good except for a couple of issues. I have difficulty sending text with pictures. Most of the time I end up sending the pic and then have to send the text separately. Also the ad at the top is annoying how it jumps around when you first open the app. It makes it so you inevitably click on the ad if you are trying to reply to the most recent text quickly. And it is not ""my internet latency."" I have the fastest and have no problem with anything else.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I paid the premium price quite some time ago but at random times over the years the ads keep coming back. You have to email and explain to customer service that you've already paid, which then they then correct it to have no ads, but it's really annoying to keep having to do it from time to time. I am stuck in one of the cycles again even though I've recently gotten text prompts from their team saying that the ""messengers enhanced features have been enabled"". Aside from that I love it though!",2
com.p1.chompsms,Ford Block,"I like the app. However, I had issues editing a theme. It didn't allow me to change color of new message bubble or navigation bar. Also it says it has Backup & Restore to an SD card. My phone doesn't have a SD card slot. So I'm not sure if it will just save to the phone. So I knocked off 2 stars. Also, I wish it could add more than one signature like Textra. If these 2 apps were combined it'd be perfect. If there was a Pro version to get these features I would pay. But I don't see Pro version.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Andi S,"As a visually impaired person, the stock SMS app on Android phones is pure garbage. This is a great replacement, and gives me most of the options I need to be able to send and receive messages easily. If I could see better, I would definitely decorate up my messages a lot more because with what vision I do have I can see that the themes offered are amazing. Definitely recommend.",4
com.p1.chompsms,kimberly lock,"I'd say I am 70% satisfied with the features, but there are a few missing parts... the individual text messages do not show the exact times. they're like grouped together and have only the time to be first message of the group was sent/received. also, when you want to share a screenshot (example) with a recent text, if the text did not come from someone in your contacts, you have to go back and find the text you want to send screenshot to instead of having a list of recent conversations.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Lloyd Pulley,"so far a very good messaging program with a lot of personalization. The only issue I am encountering so far is that, while I can take pictures to send, it doesn't seem to allow me to make videos. I have been able to send videos with all my other messaging apps (why so many apps, you may ask, and I have no good answer other than darn people won't agree on one service), but on this one, while I see setting for videos, there is no way for me to access making videos that I can see.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Been using it for years. Only have had minor issues a small of handful of times, and chomp cleared them up well. Recently had an issue with in-app notifications, and they were very prompt in responding to my e-mail, with a fix that worked immediately. Sad to see the color icon notification go, but, that's Google. Otherwise, quite happy with the app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Does everything I want. I get to assign a different notification sound for each contact. I get to decide how many times I get a notification or if it continues until I read the text. I get to choose the color of everything, font type and size too. Basically, everything you have a right to control regarding how your phone handles texts, this app refuses to stand in the way. As the standard text app that comes with android becomes increasingly less functional and relevant, this app delivers.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nicole “Mickey” Maschke,"8/12/21, champ is really a wonderful application for text messaging. But it does not have an archive function. Which, with so much economic stuff going through the text messages, is really very necessary. For that reason I'm only able to give chomp four stars. But it really is an excellent application. It's just not one that can actually compete with like a few of the others. So it still needs some work.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great App! I'm another one that never gives a review but I've been using it long enough to give credit where credit is due. It's built with all the necessary features and all the many extra ones that make it that much more enjoyable. The convenience of being able to adjust when the message actually leaves after hitting the send button is a real friend at times for changing a thought at the last moment or to make a correction. Lots of features and never fails me. Great job, Thanks.. 🎶",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jim Gerry,"Very good app, but has one little flaw. Visually, it gets a perfect 5. My issue is this, if not petty, notifications. I think if you could personalize a notification for an individual conversation, or contact, like you can for a ringtone for phone calls, would be awesome. That way you know who just texted you without having to look. That would make me give it 5.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Lou Richer,"Have been using this app for years. I like all the customizations available much more than any other app. I have used them all, and this is my favorite. There's only been one issue over time that occurs once or twice a year and that is that the notification sound I've chosen stops working. The only solution is to uninstall the app, and reinstall it. I then reset the theme, choose my notification sound, and am off and running again until the next time. Even though this is a pain, it's worth it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"My Android phone was splitting up the messages every time there was a group message, causing each person's reply to come in under their contact and not as a response to the group. Lady at the store said it was because my phone is outdated (bought it in March) and said installing a new messaging app would not help. I had already tried several apps, with no results. Then I heard about ChompSMS through a Google search, and installed it. Group messaging now works properly!! I'm so happy. Plus I love the search feature, which my other app didn't have. So far, I'm very happy with it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Robyn Buchanan,"Update: I don't think my issue was related to the app. I tried this app for several months but it had an issue showing previews of pictures and attaching them. There were so many things to like about this app, though! Pinning important conversations and giving an adjustable countdown to allow messages to be cancelled were particularly useful! If you're looking for a messaging app with quite a few useful functions, I do recommend giving this one a try - it just wasn't quite what I needed.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Overall, I like the app. However, about 25% of group messages aren't delivered and I get the APN error message. I tap to retry, and nothing happens. Only when I reboot my phone do all the missing messages start to appear. I have changed the carrier size limit and that didn't affect it. Very frustrating as I have numerous groups texting to communicate with each other. I have searched for months for any info on this problem online and found nothing.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"It's great. I like it. but could add the feature of front size setting for the text itself instead of changing the whole phone. And add the reminder of missed a text message when pick up phone? I constantly have to look for the blinking light or home button to check. Also, can you add function where we can add our own backgrounds? it would be cool.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great, great, great and welcome replacement for messaging! I wasn't happy at all with the lack of features for customing the stock messaging app. I searched, found this, and there's no going back! - (added 1/30/20) Can I add a star and make 6?!? Small bug on a feature on my phone and these guys wouldn't give up until they found the solution... Invested days into making sure it worked perfectly every time!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This used to be an awesome app with all of the personalization options, but it has since gone down in the dumps. Some options like the personalized colored notification icon has been removed. I've also been missing important texts because this app blocks them for whatever reason. I've been forced to use the built-in message app that came with the phone which absolutely sucks. Hopefully this app gets back to the greatness it once was. (I also paid to remove adds)",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Update 2: Textra does the trick! Thanks!! Love the export feature for both as well as delay send! (OK, another Star!) -- Update: Added another * because the co took the time to respond plus I like the export entire text history. -- Deal breaker for me; otherwise really like. And that is, if I want to get back with someone who has text me, but I don't want to do it now, I can write the text and just exit. It will then show up as a ""Draft"" and go to the top of the list which makes it easily seen. I also use it to mark priority. I may put a blue emoji dot or a red one which shows me a priority.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Criss Lucas,this is a really nice app with good tech support. Very large fonts are available. Good for people with vision issues. Just wish there was a private box or archive box available. Stickers would be nice as well. Pro version is very reasonable. I recommend it. UPDATE: Just contacted tech support via email and response was very quick considering it was after business hours. Problem was solved. Love this app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I needed a SMS message since my default message app wasn't ideal. I looked around at reviews before trying this one. I'm glad I did! It has been everything I've needed in a texting app! It allows me to schedule texts, as my old phone did, and it has all kinds of sweet features to customize it! My husband was using Textra but has since switched. He likes how he can customize it, including enlarging the font size. Definitely worth it for free or paid! I paid because I didn't want ads 😉",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"i really like using chomp. its easy, free and i can customize it quite a bit. there is a little latency issues, but they are few and far between. my only real issue is the ad location. i dont mind the ad, especially for a free product that works as well as chomp does, but i dont like the position of the ad banner at the TOP of my contact list as i often go to click on a contact only to find its moved because of an ad. if that ad banner were moved from the top? 5 stars.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"An excellent alternative to Google Messages, chomp SMS provides a flexible experience for anyone. If you want your messaging app to resemble older versions of iOS or Android, here's your ticket. The only gripe that I have, being on a BlackBerry device, is that there are no BlackBerry-themed bubbles or message boxes, but this doesn't detract from the overall experience still.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I used to love chomp until I upgraded my Android phone and installed chomp and now it won't let me send pictures, gifs, etc and I can't send or respond to a group text. I have checked all possible settings on everything so that's not the problem. Instead of sending the above, when I hit the send button the message or picture just disappears. I can send and receive simple messages but that's it!!!! Have also installed and reinstalled chomp several times and turned the phone off and on.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have been using chomp premium for years and loving every feature. Up until recently I have never had any issues at all. Lately, however, I have been getting group message spam from numbers not in my contacts and have discovered that you can only blacklist the top number on the send list (because blacklisting is done through the conversation list). It's a shame that I may have to find a new app with stronger security features. :(",3
com.p1.chompsms,Koriania,It provides the security layer on my texts that I want. I can't find a way to send audio clips. Every other major sms app has this ability natively. This one doesn't even recognize audio files from other apps. The lack of native audio recording is disappointing. Edit: the specified audio button will neither find files from any of the major sound recording apps nor provide native recording. My problem is not that I can't find the button. Read what I wrote about recognition.,2
com.p1.chompsms,dc9wilson,"Completely useless. Even after setting ""no file size for carrier"" I still can't send a simple audio file such as a song without getting the same error message as I get through the native app. I shouldn't have to go back to a pointless platform such as Facebook just to be able to use their Messenger app which has done this since the very beginning. It's the only app for Android that seems to be able to let me send an audio or high res video file on Android. So what's the point of this app?",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Funny, they ask me to review their app when I'm about to get rid of it. It takes longer for the ads to load, than it does the app so, I'm constantly TRYING to click on the last person I texted yet, as soon as I do, the ad loads and I'm once again thrown into Amazon or some other site. I can't pinpoint specifics, it's just not super user friendly with the lack of settings you can get elsewhere. I'm going back to Textra...",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Update: as other reviews have noted, this app seems to have trouble sending texts with attached images. None of mine are going through. I've switched back to the stock app. Original review: I've only had this app installed for a day, so I'll update rating and review if I notice any negative things down the road. But 2 features led me to use this app over the stock Samsung app or Textra: ability to fully customize the background (not just ""light"" or ""dark"") and showing contact pics with text bubbles. So far so good.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Christian Mericle,"UPDATE 2: Chomp support reached out to me after my updated review and made an effort to resolve the issue. While they gave up short of actually fixing the problem, they did at least make an effort, so kudos to them for that. UPDATE: I liked Chomp SMS until I tried to send a video. Chomp includes options to attach an already-recorded video and to “Capture Video” at the time a message is being composed. However, both options fail. The latter doesn’t even try to record before stating “Can’t record video. Not enough space in attachment.” It seems odd to include options that don’t even work but Chomp SMS support confirmed that video cannot be sent with the app, stating, ""Normally, it's best to send videos using a non MMS protocol application, that doesn't have limits, like email, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp etc."" I've switched back to my phone's default texting app which has no problems sending videos. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Works well. I switched to this because my default texting app could not send a text and a photo together in a single message. I quickly upgraded to Pro after installing chompSMS.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Had the pro/paid version for a few years. No longer. Last year, started getting mms errors. Issue went away. A few updates back, kept getting errors related to mms messages again. Could not get the issue resolved. Next update fixed it. Now after the last update, the mms error message randomly comes back. Switched to the factory message app, and it works fine. Chomp needs better quality control and testing with its app updates. Love the unique features, but tired of repeat problems. Uninstalled.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I have found the messenger customizable and a great interface. there is an ad at the top of my messages which is a little annoying, but I am using the free version. excellent app for messaging. have been using for a month now and am very pleased. woth a try in my opinion. I didnt even keep looking after I found it, it had more than I expected. emoji options are great",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Horrible job handling MMS. I have the paid version and have been using this app for years. It's a simple clean interface. That's the good; however, there have been chronic issues with handling MMS especially with pics. Also, not updated often enough to keep it functional and fresh. I'm searching for a replacement.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Shelby D,"Customization is kind of nice but it will resend messages to the receiver multiple times until you delete that message. Don't use if you don't want to inadvertently annoy the hell out of everyone you text. Update: Not a carrier issue. No other messaging app does this, and if you look up the issue on Chomp's help pages, it's been an issue with the app since at least 2018. Deflection isn't help, but thanks.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I would have given it a 5 except the ad pop up at the top is incredibly annoying. I don't care so much that they are doing ads to support the technology but hate that it occupies the same space as the new incoming message so if you got it to fast you almost always open the ad. Not cool. It is Rich in features and has enough customization but they need to put the ads on the bottom.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,A very good app. A couple of things could be made better. 1) The notification ringtone of the unread message reminder should be customizable instead of having it be the same one as the incoming message. 2) Font sizes and colors of contact's name and number in the conversation action bar should each be customizable as well. *Special note: The ad link at the top of the conversation list - misleading and annoying. Looks too much like a contact. Should be at the bottom or its appearance changed.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I am enjoying most of the options provided by this app. The 1st thing I did was enlarge the font. So far my favorite options are being able to choose a background (including pics from my pic gallery), also changing the bubble color and last but not least having the option to schedule texts. The app has been running smoothly for me so far.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"The default Messages app on my new phone was a source of torment -- glitchy, unreliable and randomly asking me whether I would like to switch my texting app from Messages to Messages. When my sister repeatedly sent me a photo I couldn't see, she suggested I break up with the Messages twins and try Chomp. A few seconds later, I not only had the photo, but all of my incoming texts were bug-free and a pleasure to open. Chomp is visually appealing, too!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sapphire Moon,"I love the various themes and the optional time stamps, but one thing I don't like is the notifications. I have a friend of mine whose texts come in batches (i.e. split up) and, for some reason, this app thinks that I need to be notified for each one (so, if the text is split into three parts, this app will ring three times, one right after another). It's really annoying and there's no setting to fix it. If it weren't for that, I'd probably give this app five stars.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Rob Box,"So. I was originally very happy with this app. So much I paid for the pro version when my free trial expired. Little did I know that it wasn't showing mms videos or multiple images sent in the same texts. Once I hopped on any other messaging app, I was able to view the information I had missed over the past month. Absolutely unacceptable and besides the customization, an absolute failure of an application.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Lucy v,"Update: I'm so disappointed that I will have to delete this app. I've come to realize that I'm missing several messages from people. That's a deal breaker unfortunately. Original Review: I've been using chomp for over a year now and its by far my favorite messaging app. I recently had to upgrade my phone and because iphone was not an option to use chomp on, it was ONE of the several determining factors in choosing to go with a Samsung again. It's been very useful with little to no issues.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I upgraded to the LG Stylo 4 from 3. They took away the ability to customize things. I got Chomp to see if i could change the look of my texts. i was surprised that i could change EVERYTHING about the way my texts look. It's really cool and the ads are only at the top of the thread list, they don't bother me at ALL. I love this app! Highly recommend. 😁",5
com.p1.chompsms,Capn B,"I've been using this for a couple of days while Next SMS was down. I like that it's lightweight, I don't think I've even seen an ad, and it can do almost everything Next SMS can do. However, there are some limitations to how I can make conversation bubbles and pop-ups look. More importantly, if I need to add or remove someone from a text thread, there is no way way to do this, instead I have to recreate the thread from scratch and add every contact all over again.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Crystal,"This app is great! You have 6 LED light colors to choose from (and the none option too) as long as your phone supports them, and you can completely customize how everything inside looks with themes. Everything from text size to colors is customizable, and you can have more than one theme saved. (I have 7.) And if you want to change part of a theme, you don't have to redo it. Just edit the theme and tap 'Save changes'. For the person who loves to customize, this is perfect & easy to use overall!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using Chomp for a few years now. And have recommended to several others. Love the customization! Only recently bought the full version, it was fine with the little bit of ads but it was only a few bucks to get ad-free. Love the ability to search and email conversations as well. Can't see using anything else. Great app!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very good texting app overall, love how customizable it is. Only real problem I've had so far is in group texts sometimes a text shows as coming from ""anonymous"" instead of showing the sender's name. It seems random and I'm pretty sure it has happened with more than one sender. otherwise it has been pretty stable and reliable.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Christie Cook,"I absolutely love this app! This is all I've used for texts (for the past couple years- sclsince I discovered it). Why? I can... - put a lock screen upon opening - stop a text after hitting send, based on your settings (I use like 2.5 seconds) - write a text & schedule it to send for a different time & date, which I use frequently - fully customize literally every detail of the appearance, including customizing the many download options. I highly recommend this app!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Apple Starlight,"Awesome texting app for anyone who can't stand the plain default texting from their provider. Can customize your own background image, text font, size, color, and even down to the color of the dot to your unread messages. Both the page of tects as well as individual text chats can be customized the same way. The easiest to understand and work with and the only app I've used for years. Very prompt and this one does not delay texts like many others do.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Lou Northern,"My needs are simple. Write a message, send a message. And be obnoxious to people with a few random GIF's. Chomp meets my needs, has a nice interface, seems rock solid. Yeah, you get the occasional ad, but they don't obstruct getting a message done (small bar at the top sort of thing). So, yeah I would recommend it. BUT.... Google play store and firefox... Not so much. Took several minutes and finally clicking the shield button and turning off enhanced protection to be able to write a review.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Dr Scribbles-McSniffle PhD.,"I usually never give five stars to an app with ads, but the ads in this app, which only start once the trial is over, are limited to a minimally invasive banner at the top of the inbox taking up the same amount of space as a message thread. This has definitely been a better upgrade from the default text messaging app that came on my phone. Highly recommend!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jule A,"I LOVE this app! So many customizations and I was happy to pay for it to remain ad free after the trial. It works much better than my stock messaging app as well. My only issue, but not worth losing a star, is it doesn't appear to allow you to block a number straight from the app. I have to go I to my contacts for that. But other than that, it has been an awesome experience. OnePlus 8 5G",5
com.p1.chompsms,christopher t,"I've been using this for several years with relatively no problems. Now, though, it just quits about 4 or 5 times a day and also it isn't sending MMS consistently anymore. Fix these bugs, please!!! OK, after receiving extraordinary help from one of the support staff, my problems have been fixed. Thanks so much - and chomp is once again my favorite texting app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Stephen Hagberg,"I do recommend this app without reservation. It integrates well with one of the computer texting intermediate programs and is a pleasure to use. I will take some time to modify the schemes and such to my tastes, but cannot complain. Thank you for building this program and for putting it out there for use. Not sure if it's my phone, but it does crash a time or two during the day but immediately resets. And I am fine with that. Again, you have a great case to be made for being heads and shoulders above the Android texting apps, and even the stated preferred app by the folks at MightyText that is supposed to fit perfectly. Great product and great attitude for excellence",4
com.p1.chompsms,Brenda Martin,"Great app. I've been using this for several years. My two favorite features are future delivery for messages and notification customization. I can have a distinct ringtone for each contact. This way, I don't even have to look at my screen to know who is texting me. Very useful feature. Also, if you ever have a technical issue and need help, their support team is top notch.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Charity “Cherdy”,"I have been using a different text app for eeons and I kept trying to send little short videos and they wouldn't go cuz they were too big (seriously!) I tried others, didn't like em, So I went back to my standby and I had to reset everything. Grrr. Chomp is free! It won't send my videos either but I'll figure it out. The one thing I would prefer is an option to color code each of my contacts differently. I'm 97% visual and I wanna see who is texting me right off.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using Chomp for a few years. I like the app for texting. I very much dislike its unreliability sending photos. Some go through in a few seconds - others never do. Sometimes I have to try several times. Another negative is its refusal to send messages that contain German and Spanish letters such as ä, ö, ü and é. An app that is supposed to enable communication should not have these flaws.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Sam Barnes,"Great app with LOTS of features that other similar apps don't have. Unfortunately, there are several bugs which the developer doesn't seem interested in fixing but maybe they only affect me so it's not worth their time. Also, it's a little slow and a slightly old design when compared to it's sister app Textra ... but that's just me getting picky. :-) Otherwise it's easily the best texting app for Android.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Rose Ford,"I was looking for an SMS messaging app, that was better than the one pre-installed on my Samsung Galaxy Note 20, (I like to have fun with my messages) when I came across Chomp. It is wonderful! I LOVE the ease of use, and I'm able to customize everything, except the ring tones, for each person, it's just one ring tone set for all messages, and I'd prefer each person have their own. Other than that, it's a great app. Give it a try! 😀😀",5
com.p1.chompsms,Dan Sullivan,I've used various sms programs over the last couple of years. Chomps is solid and one of the best. The ability to rename a group message title would be nice instead of just showing up as a list of names. Also the ability to remove someone from a group message would be really useful when someone sends a group and someone asks to be removed,4
com.p1.chompsms,John Anderson,"I have tried more than a few apps and this is the best I have found. My number one requirement is the app has to have quick text templates. This does and it works well. Works well with camera too. I didn't give it a 5 because I would like an easier way to quickly delete messages. Chomp allows multiple deletes, but I would like to see another line or two of the subject text before I delete. A one step swipe would be best.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Bryce Scholz,"I used Textra for long time, then discovered chomp. At first i wasn't sure, jus creature of habit, but then turned out i really like it. The app is great, the ways to personalize are amazing. Two reasons why i didn't give 5 stars. It's a lil buggy sometimes, kicks me out, backs up on its own. And you can't change the color of the app icon. Other then that, it's an amazing app. The ads are so minor that u hardly even notice them. Great job",4
com.p1.chompsms,D M,I have been using this app for quite some time and it has always worked properly. Since your last latest greatest update chomp keeps on crashing. I get a message that says unfortunately chop has quit working. Edit Not much has changed it doesn't crash quite as much after their help and reinstalling it now quite frequently it takes forever to send a simple text or MMS. This is a very unstable app. Sometimes it takes forever to just open the app,1
com.p1.chompsms,aje3721,"I've finally had it with this app. I've lost notification sounds for chomp for the last time. It's happened over three devices over the years. It's pretty bad when you can Google an issue and a pole of people experience the same thing. I'm done. Rather than recommending all users try this and try that, why don't YOU fix it for everyone.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Haley Ortegon,"Downloaded chomp because my phone has zero customization for the text screen. There's been a couple times when I saw that messages I thought sent didn't send, but other than that it's worked as says. Super customizable, when your free trial runs out the only ad is what looks like another message at the top of your messages, but you know it's an ad so it's not hard to avoid. I recommend if your phone doesn't offer any customization on the text screen.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Meredith Zarth,"Chomp SMS is great! There really are SO many customization options and everything seems to be working as it should - now that I have leared a little more on how to use it. Some of the features don't seem quite that intuitive. Still trying to figure out how or if I can send SMS via MMS, as my longer texts keep breaking up on the receiving end. Would be nice to find a way around that. I also added aodNotify to get an LED notification equivalent - as I lost the LED moving from S8 to S20. Luckily, Chomp SMS and aodNotify seem to be working together alright.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Harley,"The only messaging app I'll ever use. I love the customization it allows. You can create how you want ever element to look, from the background, bubble style, font, colors, everything. You can even send your creation and submit it to the developer to become one of the premade design options others can choose from to use also! I've used Chomp for the better part of a decade now, and I'll continue to use it on every device I own as long as it's available.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"if you reply to a text you may get an error telling you to use a valid phone number.

I wish i could combine the features of each. i guess there is no perfect messaging app. I will keep switching depending on what I'm trying to do.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Keri Burns,"I love this app and have used it for YEARS, mostly because of the delayed sending option that my default messaging app doesn't have. But in the last few weeks, the notification settings aren't working properly. Every text keeps reverting back to Custom which makes every text vibrate as well as the default tone I have assigned to it. Even though I've selected Vibrate Only When Phone on Vibrate in both the overall settings and for each contact. Please fix this bug if possible!",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I decided to try chomp because my messages app kept cutting me off from group messages that involved people on i-phones. Very weird. Well chomp seems to work great. The choice of skins is really nice and easier on the eye. The only cons ... there doesn't seem to be search capability which I really depend on sometimes...and I haven't figured out how to coordinate chomp with my samsung gear. Otherwise...no complaints.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Corey Lewis,"It works okay, but has a few issues. -It builds a cache constantly which grows to the hundreds of MBs and will fill up your phone unless you manually clear it. My phone was full and sending me errors, because this app had 400mb of cached information. Why doesn't it clear itself regularly? -Messages with pictures attached are slow to load as it processes and compresses the files. -Ads at the top load slowly, meaning sometimes you click on the wrong message thread as the ad tries to reload itself. -Sometimes it will get an error where it flat out refuses to add a picture to a message, it just doesn't work. But the biggest issue ever: The app puts a ""1"" country code in front of your phone number in the settings. This will *prevent* websites/verification texts from getting to you, as the website will send out such texts to your number without the 1. You will also miss texts from people at times because of this. Make sure you go into your settings and manually take off the 1. It affected me for months and I never knew why. It shouldn't even allow you to edit your phone number anyway, that's asking for trouble.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Irene LaFortune,"Compared to other top sms apps, this is my absolute favorite. Easy to use, highly customizable (including in particular, delayed sending options which I like), displays more conversations (10 on my pixelxl) than some other apps, text is very easy to read, able to easily block unwanted senders, backs up automatically using Google backup service, responsive help desk. Only con, is can't sync to a desktop, but when I want to do that, I just switch to another app temporarily.",5
com.p1.chompsms,vickie monte,"This is why I think this Chomps apps should be standard on ALL phones: 1-it allows user to add a signature. THANK YOU! 2-each text message displays date and time. FANTASTIC for documentation! 3-it allows user to get feedback on when message was sucessfully sent. AWESOME! Suggestion so far: sometimes I start a text message and have to finish it later. So it would be helpful to start a text message, backout and apps keep as draft even without a defined recepient.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Bryan McCormick,"the default Android messaging app was not sending pictures, so i went looking for an alternative. three bucks is perfectly reasonable for chomp. the background customization isn't that important but it's nice. it's not a dramatic improvement but i am happier with it than the android default. with Android, the picture could take up to twenty minutes to send out, more frequently they wouldn't send at all, sometimes saying that they did but the person never received them. chomp works how it should.",5
com.p1.chompsms,SFG / GSW,"Good app but not there yet. It needs way more customization capabilities for the visual aspects. Had to stop using it though because I tried to send a 26 second video and it said the video was too large so then I tried it with two other messaging apps and they both allowed me to send the video and it was delivered. When sending a picture, it should pull up a list of most recent people messaged instead of having to always go through address book.",2
com.p1.chompsms,James HYi,"It takes forever for pictures to show up. It is very annoying. I would have thought after how many years I've owned this app that they would eventually fix this issue. The default Google Messenger app does not have this issue, but Chomp apparently does. I really wish they would fix this. When you click on a picture to bring It Up full screen it takes a very long time to display. And no I will not contact your technical support. I have better things to do.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Fred Iccini,Edit 12/02: The feature I use the most has been replaced with the conversation sound instead of the individual sound - the main reason I used ChompSMS. Original review: ChompSMS is the only SMS app/add-on I've been able to find which can have different text sounds for individual contacts instead of individual conversations (which does me no good). I haven't had any issues with chomp and I hope it continues to be better than all the rest!,2
com.p1.chompsms,Melissa Turner,Great messaging app with lots of options. My main reasons for downloading this app are the many features and the ability to change formats. My native app is not working correctly outside the US and sometimes texts will not send until I click another button to switch to/from MMS. Chomp solved this issue for me and I no longer have problems with texting from outside the US.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Alicia Brown,The best app hands down!! I've had them all pulse etc... If you are an Android fan. This is what you have been waiting for. All the customization you didn't even know you needed. Just a few things I'm a little picky about. Having the preview of the web link would be helpful. I like to preview before I open. The pop up menu glitches sometimes and doesn't pop up also would love to be able to change that background to one from my own pics and not just a color. Other than that I would give it 5 !!,4

com.p1.chompsms,Wolfgang Willis,I prefer Samsung's Messaging App but my newest phone would not adjust the text size to the exact size I wanted it to be. Either too BIG or too SMALL along with some minor other issues but Chomp addresses all that and more! Like Samsung's app you can get premade Themes or make your own including custom backgrounds etc etc! Plus if you choose you can set all incoming messages to have colored bubbles and no pesky green ones!! =) - BUT the one thing which is hard to live without is being able to just long hold and select just the text you want to copy. Chomp makes you copy the entire text message. grrr. annoying!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Gazelle,This was an amazing experience! My phone was having a very difficult time letting me customize. They worked diligently figuring out a pretty unique problem and created a link to download into my phone that allowed this to happen. They went up and Beyond any expectations and when I told them it was okay and was about to give up they persisted and after days we got it working! I could not be happier and more pleased.

Update: seems to be working as expected with android 11.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Has a nice clean interface and LOTS of themes. Also very easy to associate text from certain sources with a particular ringtone or notification.  I really LOVE that as I do not have to look to know who the text is from.  I run this on an LG V20 and so far am very pleased with it.   They do not nag you to upgrade.   I will be willing to pay for this to help the folks who code it. I had an issue and they replied via email very quickly and helped me.   Not too many apps have that support.l  Would like to see it easier to delete an entire convo from text and suggested it.  Hopefully I will see that someday...   Thanks,5
com.p1.chompsms,Femi A.,"Chomp was working well most of the time for years. But as of the past week or so, it frequently quits unexpectedly and repeatedly, to the extent that I can not send or read texts. Moto G5 Plus (Android) phone. Love this app. It's working a little bit better now that I tried the developer's fix, but it's still not quite as good as it used to be. But thank you.",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"There are couple of problems I found with this app. Problem with sounds. For some reason it will not play some sounds. Lot of times i don't get message notifications. The reason I got this app, so I can delete individual messages. It does that nicely but not getting notifications about a message is annoying so I'm not sure I want to keep this app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Shirley Johnson Hawley,"Better than the message that came on my phone. Two things I am not happy with are the ring tones don't always keep working like I changed them. They seem to revert to different ringtones I set for all calls. Also, can't seem to click on attachments or gifs to make sure I am sending the correct photo from my gallery unless I go out of this app and click on the photo I want to share from my gallery and share from there. Or hit send then I can click and see it. Too late if I accidently send.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"SO MAD AT THE MOMENT! I've had this app for years and have LOVED it! I love how I can customize it, and schedule text to send. I have a business so I DEPEND on my text messages! I had several clients start calling telling me they had been texting and worried something was wrong when they hadn't heard back. I was ready to rip my provider, but I checked the built in texting app first for some reason, and they did show up there, so it was CHOMP 😭🤬",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Continuously almost perfect, if it's possible I'd like the option to completely block messages with multiple recipients, or at the very least turn notifications off for MMS messages but keep them on for SMS messages.

com.p1.chompsms,Zakk Sabotage,"This app is extremely annoying! Group messages are not separated, and somehow will duplicate every message you receive. It has major problems sending MMS, and will notify you about it. The ad in the free version is at the top of the list of people but takes a second to load, so if you tap your top person as it loads, it will think you tapped the ad. If you have to make alterations to your phone to get the app to work, it's not a good app.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,So far so good.... Love all the personal touches you can add to each individual contact. Love how when you add a contact a notification sound that sound comes through even in a group text. Just wish they had a way to send video's! There is no compression tool in the app to compress video's yet. If it had this I would give it 5 stars and buy the full version!!,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I can't seem to use the capture video program part of the app. Keep getting error message/black screen than it closes and says there's not enough storage. It use to work until I upgraded phone to a Note 10+. I've cleared cache and data. Still an issue. I set chomp as my default messanger because I love the customize theme part. I switched back to my regular messanger and have no issue there.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Sira Vista,"It's the best texting app it there and yet it still falls short. The support for sending animated GIFs from device storage doesn't fully work in that the result (in chomp) is a still image. Other apps show the animation, but not chomp. Also searching messages is limited and there is no way to refine your search results. It is one of the few messaging applications where you can set a notification tone on a per person basis. This even works in group conversations.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Faz Khan,I got this to deal with group text messaging issues. I've had better luck using this then with textera and google's own app. My issues are not fixed but infinitely better. The most annoying thing is the subject field which cannot be turned off. The other thing is deleting conversations needs to be done one at a time. The ads are at the top which is mildly annoying but not intrusive. Its free so im fine with that. Overall it's a solid app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I was hoping you can view 2-3 contact photos in the Conversation List when seeing a multiple contact message. Instead, you see the Number of the contacts involved and then you have tap that Number to view the contact photos. You should be able to look at it without tapping each one. Too tedious & not pleasantly pleasing... I don't want to see a big number ""2"" or ""3"" with multiple contact messages. I want to see smaller split photos in the circle. It would be faster to scroll & see the photos.",1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,So far so good. Been using chomp for a few months. Used to use Textra but it stopped being able to receive attachments from iPhone devices and some messages. Could not resolve and I hate the Samsung messaging app. Chomp is very configurable and so far has not had many issues. I would like to be able to have a few features added that Textra had but will send those requests through support.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Karl Lorenz,"This is the best SMS that I have found. It combines E-Mail, MS Office Word and SMS. There are so many options to explore; an owner's manual should be included. Fortunately, Customer Service is outstanding. I was given step-by-step instructions on how to enlarge the font for easy reading with old eyes. Suggestions for improvement are promptly addressed. I made a suggestion and within one week it was added! If Chomp is not already perfect for you, suggest improvements and it will be!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Fishman Field,"UPDATE: on July 20th, I gave the Chomp app a one star rating because it had stopped working. However, today (July 22), I'm updating my rating to 5 stars. The Chomp team immediately reached out to me and have worked diligently to fix the problem. Two days later, they have provided a fix and my app is now functioning perfectly again. This was not a mobile carrier issue as the solution did not come from t-mobile, it came from Chomp. I value the effort that was made to find/fix the problem!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Its an ok app. my main issue with it is when I send multiple pictures more than half the time it just sends one or two, I know how to change the settings with limit restrictions but it doesn't seem to matter, had the same problem with Textra.

Has everything they do... except just wish if u started a draft text but did not send it, it would move the convo to the top and show you the first few characters. SUPER annoying if you meant to send and didnt by accident and then you have to scroll through and find that convo. Maybe it's in paid version? If so I would buy!! Also, some contacts are not pulling thru to send msgs too. No idea why...",4
com.p1.chompsms,Adrian Cruzado,"Chomps is a great app. Better than the message app in my phone. The only thing I don't like is assigning notifications tones to my contacts. The notification tone is for everything. I just want to give all my contacts their own tones, not here the same tone for EVERY notification that I receive. But I still like it and use it every day. Now the notifications tone works sometimes. It is not constant!",4
com.p1.chompsms,Bob Chmielewski,"This app is great. There are only a couple of things that I wish it did the first is allow me to create groups on the fly and then select those groups to send a textthe second is certain kinds of attachment will not go directly into this app. For that reason, I have to keep to text applications on my phone and switch between them on occasion.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Ron Widner,"I originally gave this 5 stars (below) but had to revise to 1 star. After changing my sim card (to Verizon from ATT) I suddenly could not send any texts that contain photos. I changed every setting that could be related to this problem, but nothing worked. Unfortunately, Chomp has no support and a very limited knowledge base. I'll come back if this problem gets fixed. Original review (was 5 stars) Tried several and this is the best I've found. I need for texts to make an audible sound and keep making a sound until I view or answer it. Chomp allows for that and lets me choose the sound and the repeat interval. Seems like they would all work this way but practically none do. Good job, Chomp",1
com.p1.chompsms,Chris Courtade,"Update - the latest version of Android does not allow the import of downloaded fonts. Is there any way to fix this? I love creating my own themes and would love to share them. Huge fan. Best SMS app. I wanted to throw a suggestion out there. It sure would be swell to have swipe options in the message list. Swipe one way to reply and the other to delete, or a choice of options. Just wanted to suggest it. Thanks for a great app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,This is the 4th phone that I've used chomp for texting. It has every option I've ever wanted or needed I do love it. There's one thing I'm not crazy about and that is the print or font options. I'm just looking for regular print like a single lined print it's easier for me to see so I do wish they had that. But all my gosh this is a great app and I've been using it for quite a while,5
com.p1.chompsms,Matt Lewis,"I love this app except for 1 little thing that makes it completely unusable. You can't rename group texts? I have 10-15 groups at any one time for work, personal, etc. Many of the members of each group overlap, but without the ability to rename them ""coworkers,"" etc, the conversation list is just a confusing list of a million names where you can only see the first 1 or 2 for each. Unfortunately, I only realized this after spending 2.5 hrs setting everything else up exactly how I wanted it. :-(",2

Used to be able to send 10 or 12 pics in a text. Now only 1 pic. Worked great for years until early July. But for now I'll use another app. Tried about 5 others & they're all able to send multiple pics, I'm totally puzzled by this. Used it for years sending multiple pics, now it doesn't anymore, but other apps do.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Rebecca Tucker-White,"I love using(Chomp), I can type up a message and schedule it for a specific time then I am done. I aint got to worry about it delivering to that person; it always makes it to them on time. The app itself has so many different ways and themes to set up and change. You can edit almost everything, from the picture to the color of the # in the clock. I suggest using this app over anything.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Narges Sayyadi,"I've been using Chomp for two years. It has everything that anyone can expect from a messaging app and more! It's very user-friendly and you can customize it in any way that you want. The customer service is perfect! Once something happened to my app, so I contacted them and asked for help. They replied in no time! After about a week or so, they fixed the bug. They're very responsible and they really care about users. Install it on your phones right now without any further ado!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nik C,"I had been using the Mood messaging app for a # of yrs due to the customization features...then it became very ""glitchy"" with lots of delays. Fortunately, after some research, I landed on Chomp. I am more than pleased with the customization that it offers and it's ease of use! It works exactly as described without any ""glitches"" YAY!! One request for future updates: I'd love to be able to use my personal images for theme backgrounds. Thanks for a great app!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Lots of good stuff here, a couple of annoying things. It's a pain to have to go though multiple steps to delete convos. A swipe delete, or remember this action for further deletes to get it to a long press and delete would work well. Trying to match a color you want through your entire theme is difficult. Either a use this color for all, or at least have the color value available to copy/paste would help. Bugs me to see NO SUBJECT when someone sends a pic. Don't think that's necessary.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Angelique Jackson,"Pretty decent messaging program. I wish I could see just the media sent between the person/people I've been texting with (i.e. Signal).

com.p1.chompsms,Libby T,"I had a seven day ad free trial (that I was actually unaware of, thanks) and it was great. Once the trial ended though, Chomp started glitching a bit. Still a great app, but it sometimes kicks me off the app randomly when I'm trying to scroll through GC (group chat) messages. The ads are very small and not invasive 👌. Apart from kicking me off the app randomly, even with ads, this app is usable.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I was using ""Messages"" because it came with my phone. Soon I found the notification ringtone was not working. Many others experienced the same thing. When I Googled what was the #1 texting app, the reply was Messages. When I asked what was the #2 app, the reply was Chomp SMS. Soo, I installed Chomp. It works flawlessly. It is easy to change ringtones and use the setup features. This should be the #1 texting/messaging app, hands down. Thank you.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This used to be a fantastic app. Not anymore. The emojis changes constantly. One time you can find an emoji here the next time the same emoji is in another category. Sometimes they no longer exist. I'm have a problem sending mms files, and sometime just plan text messages, again. I switched over to another app and there's no problems. Voice recognition for voice to next has gone so far downhill I can't even use it.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Rick Buffington,"I'm not really pleased with this app. They tout a blocklist feature that doesn't work for group SMS messages. You can't even leave feedback on the app because the UI is so poorly developed that the keyboard populates on the screen in a way that renders the submit button useless. I may just get a flip phone, because big tech has truly destroyed even the most basic of technology functions. The fact I cannot submit feedback within the app due to an incompatible UI is both laughable and ludicrous.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Tweety,"Had Chomp for a few years and love it. Suddenly last night 5/5/20 everyone was quiet! No text from anyone. While trying to text someone, all I saw was a black screen! Both my husband and I with our S9 and S9+. Had to go back to Messages and saw my missed texts. My sister with her S10 seems to be working fine. We have written in an inquiry and waiting for a response. Will update post once issue is fixed. Chomp's recommendation is to uninstall-install app. Not happy to hear that. Moving to 2 stars",2
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I give the app credit for having awesome designs for conversations. My problems are that you never really know when a message delivers because it does not say. Most the time it actually does Not send. You also can not send any sortov video over a few seconds. When you receive any video it treats it as though you receive a virus. This app really needs improvement. 😕,2
com.p1.chompsms,K Hodge,"I like the app so far since it's a lot like handcent (next sms). The only things I want to see changed are better spam filters and the option for individual conversation theme settings instead of one picture for all messages. It'd also be cool to get the message reactions on this one too (it's nice to see those as they are and not as a new text that ""this person reacted to your message"".",4
com.p1.chompsms,nautiguy,"When you click on the text link in contacts, the dialer app, or any other app that takes you to the meesages app to send a text to that person it opens up Chomp to an existing contact (usually the same one) withe their name in the to line and a bunch of tips in the message area. There is nothing there that pertains to the person that you just sent there from contacts or wherever.",3

Today I noticed that although all permissions and notifications are set correctly Chomp refuses to make a notification sound when I receive messages. I've missed some rather important texts due to this. Disappointing.

It's frustrating.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Kevin Keller,"Good app. Probably best out there, however, recently the app does not allow me to add photos or gifs to the body of the text, which is the reason for the low rating.

com.p1.chompsms,Juliet Markowski,"Absolutely in love with it. It can be personalized to your own taste, themes, fonts, emojis, color fonts and different way of a messaging app. I have already told ppl how much I love this new message app. 😍❤️ Update it no longer works like it did when I first downloaded it. I don't get messages or sometimes the notification doesn't work. You can't delete any texts messages so you have a bunch of texts messages that you don't want. It's been glitchy. So I uninstalled it.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Rocky Spino,"After years of loyal use of another premium messaging app....and non-existent support from its developers....I decided to bail. What a nice surprise to find Chomp! Not only does it provide the ""full"" customization I desire, but also real live customer support!! App set-up was user-friendly, and my must-have features were easy to find. When I did reach out with a question, I got an immediate and accurate response. Wow!! Appreciate using this fun app...and not feeling under-supported! 🙂",5
com.p1.chompsms,Ken Regel,"Works like a champ. I have a Galaxy10 which the native messaging app stinks, so I was using Google Messaging which started to get REALLY problematic in not sending messages. So I switched to Chomp, I am mostly happy, its quick, doesn't hang up and just works without issue. My only complaint is it doesnt have a swipe to delete function, you have to longpress a msg, select delete then answer a follow confirm, which sucks.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Johnny Reyes,I've used chomp off and on for several years and always seem to come back to it. No problems with notification sounds for individuals. Only gripe would be that I wish they would increase the size of photos allowed and also videos don't seem to go through as they appear to be too large in size. Other than that it's a great app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"DON'T DO IT!!! Although it works wonderfully at first, once the ads kick in not only will the app malfunction and stop receiving & sending texts, but even after you delete the app you can NEVER get the ads from your phone!

com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,I like this app. I switched from an app I had use for years through multiple phones. I would love to be able to pull down the notification in the notification bar ablnd read the entire message.

com.p1.chompsms,Jim Chong,Definitely love this app. There are specific features of this texting platform that are unique and I specifically love the ability for scheduled messages as well as being able to send group messages with people being able to respond to the group or yes back to me. Easy-to-use and lots of flexibility in the interface.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Nobody Atall,"I've been using chomp for probably 8 years now & I absolutely love it . It has the most awesome interfaces that you can edit with your own fonts and colors to make texting any way you want it. It's the best app that I've ever used & I tried them all before I decided on Chomp. It has all the features such as blacklisting, deleting whole conversations, forwarding, delayed message sending and your choice of emojis, U don't have to stick with what Android tells you.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,It's stupid that android decided to get rid of the signature option in messages so that's what led me to this messaging app. I've used others but the versatility of Chomp is excellent. It's worth the less than $3 to pay for the app and lose the ads. I had an issue with changing font size and the response from support was quick and helpful.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,on the free version ads are well timed to pop up in the conversation list in a way that shifts the conversations causing me to select the wrong one. if i am selecting the first conversation its where the ad shows up and i end up going to the ad page quite often without meaning too. i dont mind having ads if its free but there should be a more tasteful way of displaying them where the user isnt tricked into clicking on them.,1
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Works great - far better than most Android messaging apps on my Pixel 2. There's only a couple things i wish it could do. First is sync messages (MMS/SMS) with my Chromebook and Chromebox the way iPhones can sync with Macs. Second, if like to be able to ""like"" or ""laugh at"" messages, like on iPhones. I have actually paid for the app, though, and it's definitely with it as far as I'm concerned - I do a /lot/ of messaging, and this has been the only message app that's worth it! Keep it up!",4

One would expect that Standards for these basic functions (SMS/MMS) would be as fixed as those for storage devices and networks.

Its an excellent texting app. Its extensive customization options is a great solution for users with less than perfect eyesight. But the tiny editing area of only 3 lines was the deal breaker. Having to keep scrolling back and forth to see what I've was annoying as hell. Especially with today's larger screen phones, having a 3 line editing window is nonsense. Yaata has same level of user options with larger edit area. [Glxy A20 unbranded]",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Love the customization options! I downloaded a ton of other sms apps before finding this one and none of them had the varierty or versatility of this one. Most importantly, the ads for the free version dont pop up and interupt texting like most apps with a variety of background choices; ads are a simple small uninstrusive banner at the top of the messages. Would highly reccomend this app!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"used to think Chomp was great, but now whenever I scroll through text conversations, it jumps so much that it is impossible to navigate. It does not stay where your finger is on the screen. It's extremely frustrating and disorienting, so I might have to switch texting apps, unless they can fix this.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Chomp works very well. It remains one of the most customizable SMS/MMS Messengers today but I'm afraid time has finally passed it by. It works fine with Samsung's RCS. Lots to like, but you still cannot export vCards, there are no GIF's except thru keyboard, no Stickers, no sneak preview of web links, MMS messages don't appear in the Quick reply, and no way to mute group chats. The good, the quick reply still works including lock screen. Textra is better.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Just noticed I've been missing incoming messages. Checked my normal messaging app that comes pre-installed after about a year or more of using this and found a bunch of messages I hadn't received. Carrier is T-mobile, please fix this asap as I really like this app. Edit: After messing around for a while trying to find a fix, I found that making my built in app the default app again, and then making chomp the default app again fixed the issue.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Kathy S,"So far I really like this. I've tried half a dozen and I think this is the one. I do wish for 3 things: (1) that links sent to me were live links so I wouldn't have to copy and paste into my browser to see; (2) ability to swipe messages into a general Archive folder to get them off my home message screen; and (3) intercept the Apple IOS ""Liked"" function that repeats the entire message you sent and replace with an emoji or something. Good luck to your company!",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Google had temporarily prevented colored icons on the notification panel and on the always on screen. At that time you guys took that option away. However, for a while now the option is back and other apps are doing it. Can we get our colored icons back? Also, can we make it possible to pick the color based on the specific contact? This would allow us to tell at a glance who texted, even if we were not present to hear the specific notification tone.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Wooper,"I have been using ChompSMS off and on since I purchased it in 2013-2014. The amount of customizations is unmatched besides mayber their other product, Textra. While the app is functional, it is disappointing that hardly anything has been been in its appearance. It appears to be stuck in 2014 - but maybe it works in its favor. If you want a more modern looking SMS with modern design language, check out Textra.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Brenda McCreary,"I knew nothing about the Chomp app, I took a chance and installed it and I love ❤️ it. It does what I want to do, easy to use. Update: Sept 8, 2021, I'm still using the Chomp app, I still prefer it to others, BUT I have not been able to send or receive MMS messages & I cannot figure out how to fix this problem. I have researched online for days, have not found the fix.. I have seen many others with the same issue. Please fix or tell me how. Frustrating!!!!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Randall Morris,"I decided to give this app a try. Really really like it a lot. All the custom settings are great. I like to be able to have a certain notification for my text messages. This app allows me to set a custom notification just for my text messages. That way when I hear it, I don't have to wonder if it's a text message, email or anything else possible. The adds are not bad at all. There's just one add that pops up on the top of your messages, no big deal at all. I will continue to use it on any phone.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Jennifer Cannady,"Only thing I do not like is that it won't let me send videos; says they're too big no matter how short it is. I have to reactivate my old SMS to send a video, then reactivate Chomp when I'm done. Maybe it's me or my phone!! I don't send vids often so it's no trouble. Other than that, app is much, much better than stock SMS that accompanied my phone.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Grant,"Great replacement for my default messenger. Only issue I ran into was that Amber alerts seem to be repeated indefinitely if you have the ""repeat alert"" option on.

com.p1.chompsms,Del Doherty,"I like it, there's more customizability and options for when and what of a message you're trying to send. when the free version expired, I barely noticed aside from the message telling me it was. there's only a small boundry ad at the top of the convo list only. the only complaint I have is some of my emojis don't show up. I see them on my keyboard, can see them in the message draft, can't see a few after I sent them, but my friend I send them to can see them. only a few do this so its minor.",4
com.p1.chompsms,D L,"Very good phone text app; only minor critique I have is that if you want to copy/paste texts, you can only copy one text at a time. Other texting apps produce check boxes allowing you to select multiple texts at once, but that's my only criticism. Other than that, I like it. : )",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love the high level of customization options, honestly the main draw for me in a messenger app. Aside from that, all the basic needs are covered. No major issues or crashes so far. Only downside I have faced so far is apparently the app is a power hog. If I leave the app open my phone keeps flagging it as a power issue. Also I'm not fond of ads BUT I tend to forget about it anyway and I am aware there is a paid version.",4
com.p1.chompsms,LaLa,"Man I love this app but there are too many messages picked up by my stock app and missed by this one. (One was about a fraudulent charge on my credit card. Not something you wanna miss.) I highly doubt it's the interim carrier reason given several times because the stock app wouldn't get them either if that were the case. Any idea what else could be the cause? Can the app get ""too full"" and I need to delete more messages? Thanks.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Thomas Carrano,I like chomp for the group texting. You're able to text larger groups. However there has been a time or two when I send a group text sms (replies come only to you) & something went wrong. Everyone was getting the replies. I checked the settings & it was still on the correct setting. Seems to correct by deleting previous text. As if too many saved text create an over load. Note: I am not too tech savvy,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"This is exactly what I have been looking for... The past few days I have looked at so many text apps and I've had textra for a few years, but I wanted something more than colored bubbles and Jason sent me Textra's sister app...You can set different themes or make you own And you can choose the sound of sent messages. Love it. Editing my review and gave it 4 stars because you can't send videos like Textra or stock messaging.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Karyn,"Would be a 5 The customization choices are unparalleled with loads of themes plus ability to choose fonts, sizes, colours, etc. BUT I find it SO irritating to receive my messages in group texts TWICE (just to me, but STILL) that I'm deleting the app!

com.p1.chompsms,Judith Martin,It's a decent app for messaging. The glide typing is terrible. I'm constantly having to correct what it enters. I also hate that you can't personalize your friends a little easier. The method this has is pretty bizarre and difficult especially if you're new to smart phones. Make it easier!!,4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I love this app and so does everyone I recommend it to. Downside is, I just upgraded to the OnePlus 7 Pro and the app does not let you delete any messages. Emailed them and was recommended to use the sister app (Textra) but it is not near as awesome. Thought it was a one off problem but one of my customers (I work at T-Mobile) who uses the app too, did not work on hers either. Sounds like a OnePlus issue. I hope this gets fixed because I would hate to switch to a different app.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"So i gave this app a 3 because my experience thus far has been good and bad. I enjoy the thorough customization it offers, but it could use an upgrade on the themes offered as well as being able to cusfomize individual chats. Also there have been times where i respond to a text when it pops up for a quick reply, but when i check back the text not only didnt send, its as if it was never written at all. So ill sit there waiting on a reply from them, but theyre actually waiting for mine.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Missy Rodriguez,"I have used Chomp for several years now and love it! It allows you to totally customize everything...from the backgrounds to the individual contacts ...even what color light blinks when you have a notification. I used chomp on my Galaxy S8+ for about 3 yrs until it stopped sending messages...but as soon as I upgraded to a Galaxy Note 20 ultra I downloaded the app and it works perfectly!

com.p1.chompsms,W R,"Use to really enjoy using this app. Go sms pro stopped working, so I downloaded chomp. This was a good app because I could set individual custom ringtones and colors. Now I set the ringtones and sometimes I can get one message with the set ringtones, others it automatically defaults to the system set ringtone. Very annoying. The app has been Uninstaller and reinstalled with no luck. Looking for a new app, sucks because I paid for this one.",2

You can basically customize everything including the font size, text color, bar color, etc. You can do so much with it! I've told everyone I know about it. Definitely the BEST text messaging app out there.",5
com.p1.chompsms,james rainey,"I like that it's called chomp lol. I like that it offers the scan for fonts feature, but it doesn't work super well for me and its hard to go thru the menu and find the fonts when they're sorted by app. I also wish I could customize the themes/colors of individual convos within a theme (helps tell people apart). But other than that it's one of the better customizable text apps I've tried.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Brandon B,I've loved Chomp for multiple years. It's my go to txt/MMS period! I'm very frustrated now bc I can't send mms with chomp anymore. Just all of a sudden I get the red exclamation point on any pic or gif I attempt to send. However when I switch from using chomp over to the native messaging app that came pre-installed I can send pics just fine. But chomp refuses to operate correctly. Please fix this or help me!,2
com.p1.chompsms,Joel,I loke the app but after my last update from AT&T it is glitchy. Sometimes the keyboard is transparent and you can see the text underneath. Sometimes the whole screen is blurry and unreadable. I have to lock and unlock my phone or it is like looking through a frosted window. I wish they had GIFS in addition to emojis and I wish you could send larger than 1 MB videos. In settings there is an option to send unlimited size but I'm still not able to send anything bigger than 1 MB,4
com.p1.chompsms,Len Philpot,"I bought Chomp Pro several years ago and have generally liked it. I'm not a heavy texter and don't need tons of interactive features but Chomp works fine for me. So why only three stars? As far as I can tell (which matches what I've seen from others) there's no way to blocklist group texts. You can't even manually blocklist the individual texts in a group message. Particularly during the height (depth?) of COVID lockdown, I was often dragged into irrelevant group texts that went on forever, and Chomp offered no way to deal with them. The absence of this long- and often-requested feature has me now evaluating other texting apps, despite otherwise generally liking Chomp.",3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,Chomp needs to add new wallpapers more often. I've been having lots of trouble with the texting app I've been using for years & finally have found this one which also has wallpapers for the texting background. I don't like to use the stock sms app since it's just boring. I love the ability to have various wallpapers again. So far so good right now. Thanks.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Brandy Phillips,"I like that this app allows you to be as fun as you want. Personalized ring tones for each person who seems a message. Choose colors per person and chat. Add a colored dot next to unread texts of your color preferences. 1 thing u would add to this message app, would be to add a ring tone to group texts. But that's the only change I would make.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Just A Guy,"Been using the paid version for many years. I still prefer Chomp to most others, as it offers the most visual customization, especially compared to stock Google Messages. One issue that has continuously happened is every time I switch phones, Google messages works fine, but Chomp SMS messages are corrupted, out of order, and mislabeled. I've tried using Google data migration, as well as SMS backup and restore, and still, Chomp is corrupted. And Chomp as zero real support, so if something does pop up, there's no real help. I've tried several times.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Susan M.,I really like Chomp but it would be so much easier to see who is in a group text rather than having to look at a number when some of the group texts may have the same number and then having to figure out who's in the group. I've used Textra for years but decided to try Chomp and love the ability to customize so much. It would be more user friendly and a great feature to have group pics instead of numbers. PLEASE consider adding this feature to Chomp as you do with Textra!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Marilee Aschwanden,"It's now 2021 & I've left & come back after realizing this is the best text SMS app out there, the grass wasn't greener on the other side.

com.p1.chompsms,Brent Mote,"Maybe all my problems are self-inflicted, I just don't know enough about the app yet, but I have a few peeves that drop the Chomp experience down a couple of stars. First, once I select a photo to send I can't preview it to be sure it's the right one. Second, the quick reply window has a tendency to disappear before I'm ready to send and I don't know how to retrieve it. There's probably a way to do that but I haven't discovered it yet. And third, my gifs lose their animation making them stills.",3

I love the customization and quick compose/reply interface and those things make the little quirks worth it",5

Now chomp SMS has (AGAIN) started freezing up and closing in the middle of me trying to type a text or read a text. If a new text came thru the app completely closed when I would try to open it and read it. All of this after the newest update.

The support team is great and usually responds within 24 hours which is awesome. It's a solid app. Give it a try. Thanks Chomp Team",5
com.p1.chompsms,Brian Cayo,Wonderful! Only thing I'd add is the ability to read an entire text message when you arrow down to reply from the notification bar! In other words tapping the down arrow in upper right corner to reply to a text message should also expand the contents of the message also! Like I said great app...worth giving a try!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Fred H Fath,I recently switched to this app after using another for probably over 12 years. I did this for 3 main reasons. First this app is very customizable and similar to old app. Second due to the Sprint- T Mobile merger had issues sending MMS with old app. Third my old app's tech support wasn't the best. The suport I've received from Chomp has been top notch and fast response time. Glad I made the switch and can now send MMS again.,5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very customizable. Works well with my Samsung watch. The only problem I have is that it is slow to start up, I believe because it is loading up an ad each time.

No only do I have ability to add a subject heading for text, the app blends or syncs well with Andoid.

Overall the app is so user-friendly you don't need a ton of customer support, but it would be nice to see a website or something. UPDATE on Feb 1, 2022: After getting a quick response from customer service and getting my questions answered, I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 and I upgraded to the pro version of the app. This is the best app I've purchased in a long time!",5

Keep up the great work developers!!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Kevin Hopkins,"I have been using chomp for quite some time. I love the security aspects of the app. My only issue that I have is the MMS feature when large images are sent. Even when you have the settings selected ""Carrier send limit = Carrier has no limit"" selected, it still sends an error message and at times prevents other messages from the same message group from arriving. Aside from that issue, I would have given it a 5 star rating.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Shakthi Hammer,"Follow-up: Hi there, Thank you for the quick response. The magnifying glass does a search for all the contacts and doesn't allowtogo back to the list and have to search all over again. Other apps has one for each contact and highlights the words with an up-down arrow. Not sure if this can be added. Great experience overall. I would have given it 5 stars if this had a search option. Disappointed that it doesn't, or maybe I just can find it. Spent an obscene amount of time looking for old texts 🥺",4
com.p1.chompsms,John Ready,"I like it but it's not perfect. I switched to it for templates but they all appear in same type on same background - I have to look closely to spot where one ends and other begins. Also, if choosing a Contact only offers 1st number and only way to get msg sent to alternate number for that contact seems to be to type it manually. * Developer has suggested I try turning off ""Mobile only"" and that works but is deceptive* For all that it's better at handling my needs than some big name alternatives",4
com.p1.chompsms,Lisa Basalla,"I like the customizeable everything in this app. I ha e used this for years, but in the last few days I no longer see notifications on my lock screen, badge bar at the top or in my pull down notification drawer. If it was not for the notification on my Versa 4, I would miss all my texts. Please fix this.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Paul Dutton,"UPDATE!!! App has been updated and is working properly! I was using the program and it kicked me out and haven't been able to use it since, when trying to use it, it doesn't even load. This is the best most flexible and customizable sms app I've ever used! It's great and the support team is very prompt answering questions/concerns. Thank you for such a wonderful, awesome sms experience!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Howard Matthews,"Superior to the preinstalled app but I used to have different tones for texts and emails, now they're both the same one. EDIT: Looks like it's not this app but a system change, there were separate settings for each & now there's just one setting.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Allan Grossman,"I've been using Textra (Pro) for years and absolutely love it. Far better than the stock messaging app or any of the other 3rd party SMS apps I've tried (and that's a LOT 😉). Only just learned that Chomp was developed by the same folks as Textra and adds significantly more features and customization options for those of us who like to fiddle and make our apps ""our own"". I've been using it for several days now and it's GREAT. As good as Textra is, I'm enjoying Chomp even more.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Truth Or Consequences,I really love the app! The only problem is it's a little hard to follow sometimes.I would like to be able to back up my messages to a file without jumping through hoops I do like that you can send them to your email but I would like to be able to use the file and I'm not sure if you allow that to happen-also I have lost all of my messages a couple of times and I don't think it was anything I did so I wasn't too happy about that. I give you four stars because there's always room for improvement!!,4
com.p1.chompsms,Louise LMF,"I love this app for texting because you can customize colors, fonts, type size, images, etc. Definitely better than stock app. Individual notification sounds, blocking, etc help save time and cut down on interruptions.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Pastor Akin Bandele,"App stops working. I have used this app for almost a year to send group messages with no problems. But in the past 5 weeks, it stops working. I see a red ! by my message and no one receives my group messages. Please fix this bug; hope it's not your update causing my issue.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Kemeko M,"Update; it's been crashing a lot, might be because I have an older phone s10 from three years ago. But still a good app. It force closes when I send a message sometimes, seems to still send them properly. Use it on every phone! Love that I can custom it.",4
com.p1.chompsms,S Davi,"I like the app, and continue to use it because I seem to lose data with the Pixel 6 stock texting app. However, I would give it a perfect review IF: RE: text notification, if I don't mark as read I will get a second notification later. Also, regularly, I stop getting notified and have to click the ""test"" in settings or reboot to get it to work.",2
com.p1.chompsms,Cat Lincoln,"I absolutely love this app. Have had it for a few years now and always have it on a new phone, it is so customizable. I have reviewed it before a few years ago to criticize having no private box, which quite a lot of other users requested, but it is such a good app in other ways I will give up on that one and still give it 5 stars anyway.",5

I pay for unlimited 5G and have a phone which records 4k@60fps and takes gorgeous pics....but I can't f***Ing share them because they are ""too big for Facebook messenger"" and ""size limit reached"" in ChompSMS.

I'd be willing to pay again for ad-less, but it won't allow me because I already have the paid version. HATE THE ADS IN MY PAID VERSION!!!",1
com.p1.chompsms,David White,"I cannot get them to solve some long-standing + repeatable issues that made this app frustrating to use. Every time I email they ask for the same thing they asked for previously + that I did/sent. This is a waste of my time, not support. I am a paid user + like the app except for the problems and failure to use what I previously collected and sent.",1
com.p1.chompsms,E K,"I was just charged by Google for my annual Chomp Pro subscription and suddenly today I'm getting ads after updating. App is now asking a one time fee for Pro. Huh? If this is a new payment model then why did I just get charged for a ""subscription"" and did not get any notice of the change? No info online anywhere. Or is this just a bug? Very frustrating!",2
com.p1.chompsms,Renee G,Love the app!! Had it for years. But haven't been able to change themes lately. Keeps saying this app has a bug.. I've updated and reinstalled.. help. Thanks,4
com.p1.chompsms,Phil Stracchino,"Chomp SMS is my favorite SMS app. The killer feature it has that stock SMS apps don't have is not its extensive list of downloadable skins, though some of those are very cool and there's enough variety that almost anyone will be able to find one they like. The real killer feature is Chomp's ability to blacklist senders of SMS spam (or anyone else you don t want to ever speak to again) and simply reject their messages unseen. Sadly I recently discovered this does not work for MMS spam.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Richard Roosa,"Good, so far. Been using for about a month. Has not crashed or hung up. Be patient with setting individual ringtones, took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to achieve success. Once i got the hang of it it was smooth sailing from thereon out.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Donal Slemon,"Decided on this app from reading other reviews. It mostly does what it says on the box but I'm disappointed as most times I'm not getting SMS notifications that are sent from my bank, nor those that I use for other apps to confirm sign in with 2FA. Occasionally with the latter I receive if I hit resend on the app I'm signing in to. I don't have any of these issues as soon as I switch my default messaging back to my previous app. Phone is a new Redmi note 10 s running Android 11.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Bruce A,"If you click on the menu button, there are only a few options. And one of them is to entirely delete all of your messages. I can't think of a worse idea. But there is more. There is a backup/restore option. All this does is backup or restore your settings. Not your messages. So you might think you're safe, but you're not safe. This is a joke of an app. Try use your phone in the rain or after a few drinks and you're going to end up with a completely blank phone. It is verging on malware imo.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Judai Winchester,"I like this app and was a good replacement for the last sms app I used to use. However, there seems to be a bug in the system whenever I try to edit my theme (customization) and the app keep crashing. Can somebody please look into this and get this fixed? Thanks.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Shay S,"I usually love this app but now there are group text spammers. When I try to block via long hold I do not have option to block sender in a group text, only for a single person texting. And now there is a repeated error message pop up but that app is working fine.. Please fix and I'll upgrade review. UPDATE: and now weird numbers that end in a dash cannot be blocked either.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Bonnie Mulligan,"Good. Just one request: when the messages pop on the status bar, I'd like the option to mark read in addition to replying. It's cool that you can swipe the notification to mark read, but I want the notification to go away while leaving the message marked as unread or having the option to mark it read.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Tristin Young,"This is a feature rich program which allows great customization! There are a few features I miss from other programs that I have used in the past, however, this program meets many of the needs which I was seeking. It is well worth the time to customize to your heart's content.",5

com.p1.chompsms,Daniel S. Lewis,"Love this app. Went away for awhile, but found myself coming back again. Update: Still love the app but it's getting left behind. It has a lot of features sure, but now a days, you need protection as well. There is no encryption protection, plus no chat capabilities. With as long as this app has been around, you'd think they'd keep up with the times and keep their pro users happy? Hell, I'd even pay an upgrade fee if it wasn't outrageous, as I said I love the app, they just update to 2022.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Laurel,"Love how customizable this app is, and its not as glitchy as some text apps I've used. However, it would really benefit from 1) the ability to schedule texts and 2) an archive. Both of these features are available on Textra and Pulse.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Michelle Chin,"I do like this app very much, and have been using it for awhile now. However, lately I have become super annoyed with all the spam text that are overwhelming my space. These people are not on my contact list and I have not given them permission to text me. It seems the more I block, is the more spam I get. I feel I'm working too hard trying to rid myself of this aggravation. Please fix this.",4
com.p1.chompsms,PawsitiveThinking,I like this app alot. It's missing the fifth star because you cannot schedule multi recipient texts. You can schedule single recipients. So if you're planning something and need to text everyone you can't schedule it.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Jeffrey Jones,"I absolutely love this messaging app! I am a pro user and have been for a year or two now and totally support it. However, since the last update for some reason it's not sensing my pro status and it keeps telling me to pay for pro even though I already did. Other than that it is absolutely amazing Please fix this little bug thank you :-)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Noel Jones,"The stock app that came with my new android 11 phone was very dull. I wanted to add my own notification sound but would not get it to work. I searched for another app and came up with this one. I love the fact that you can customise the colours etc. and of course my ringtone. After using the app for a while, I got a message to tell me my add free trial was up, so I purchased the full version and am very happy with it. I am 73 years old and find everything about it easy for me. A happy bunny.",5

com.p1.chompsms,les wilkinson,"UPDATE I found chomp and decided to give it a try, as it's made by the Devs that make the excellent Textra SMS app🐯.. I am hooked, this app has just about everything you might need in a SMS / MMS app, and more. All I can say about the app, is it needs to be on your phone. The free version has ads, but they are hardly noticeable. But personally i would go for the paid version. You can't go wrong with Chomp SMS. Thanks developers, for all the work you have put into the app",5
com.p1.chompsms,Robert Jenkins,"I paid, and this app still connects to your ad server, and yahoo, to phone home. Askng me to contact you, when you know your app does this, is senseless. Just turn off tracking and spyware and ad connections if people pay. Simple.",1

com.p1.chompsms,David Ransom,"So far, it's been an excellent app. Much better than Pulse SMS that just STOPPED working on me one day??? My only suggestion for this app: Make deleting a message 'swipe-able'... instead of having to go thru the menu system to do so.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Izabela R,"I think it's a beautiful app, they way I've got my custom theme/colours I made. It doesn't take longer to load with a theme than without unlike another app. I'd add that it would be great if there was a search button to narrow down a search by colour or style. So far seems better than most messaging apps. I wish this app had a dot on the app showing I had an unread message though.",5

There are several themes you can choose from and customize, too. So many different ways to customize! And the customer service is great, too. I haven’t really noticed any ads, either. I highly recommend Chomp.",5

com.p1.chompsms,denise kiser,Absolutely the worse app on the market for texting. Half your messages will not go out and you will not know people are not receiving you messages. You will also fail to receive messages and sometimes the app will send a ton of messages to people all at once bc it didn't send them to begin with... Any positive review is a bot. Don't download this app!,1
com.p1.chompsms,Jo Susan Clapp,"I have had the Pro version of Chomp forever. I can't imagine using another messaging app. Chomp is infinitely customizable and feature rich. Don't even bother with its competitors. Chomp rocks them all. Two years since I last reviewed Chomp, and it's still the only messaging app for me. Okay, only 3 months after my last review of this excellent app, am I seeing pop-up ads in my paid Chomp? Say it ain't so, Joe, 'cause that would be a deal breaker for me.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Nat Goodchild,"I have used Chomp fort at least 15 years. It works perfectly, sending and receiving SMS's without being intrusive and attempting to take over all messaging functions. I strongly recommend it as the best SMS app. I haven't had ads in the app, which is a bonus",5

Added May 4, 2022: Just wanted to add that the Chomp Team (Jason, Mandy, et al) continue to provide great customer service/technical support. All app developers should respond the way they do. I could list half a dozen apps where I emailed support and never got a response. The Chomp folks care about their customer base and it shows.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Natasha “ThatFreckleFaceLady” Cade-Batek,"Now looking for another SMS app. Attempted to talk to customer service (got Max) and they feel it's in their best interest to get smart and patronize their customers. No one should have to explain how to provide good customer service. 1st, apologize and be empathetic, even if you don't mean it, it's NOT hard. 2nd, you don't get smart, ESPECIALLY when someone explains the issue with the app interfering with a medical situation. It is not hard to be a good person, you can do better, so be better",1
com.p1.chompsms,Zyngarde,"A great customizable message app further improved with nova launcher. There are scarce few aspects I can't tune to my liking. I just wish there was a way to further shape the message bubbles and notification icon (the thing in the top bar, not app icon. Nova can fix the latter)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Asha M,I have Verizon wireless and my messages stop sending it's done this multiple times.

Very disappointing because it never did that before.",4

com.p1.chompsms,Mitchell Bradley-Williams,"Used to be very good been using for many years, but with recent updates messages are failing to send, when I submitted a report they insisted that it wasn't because of chomp despite describing the problem, but when I use stock messaging app texts are sent fine with no issues.. Shame",2
com.p1.chompsms,Steven N Picton (Steve),Been using this app for years. Love the customization and the quick responses from the support team. I really appreciate not having to use the proprietary apps that were included with my last 3 phones. Continuity between devices is wonderful.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Kirsten Kay,For the most part love it so far. I am having issues with NO Notification of receiving a message I have addressed in the app settings (and get a sound when I send) but still no notification of receipt.???? Only thing I don't like.,3
com.p1.chompsms,Kelley Le Beaux,I tried other texting apps because I didn't like the standard app on my phone & I kept coming back to Comp so decided to try it out. I love how you can customize the texting environment & it tells me if my messages were delivered or not. I would recommend this app.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Kiara Petersen,"Favorite part of the app are the themes you can use, it makes it so much easier and fun to use. Only complaint about the app is that I don't get iOS emoji reactions. Which might just be a problem because I'm an Android user in a family of apple users and they are obsessed with text reactions lol. But it would be nice if Chomp could get reactions at some point.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jeremy Stocker,Samsung native messaging system received an up date that greatly hindered group messaging. So I switched to Chomp.

First of all, I am not an employee or paid person to do this review, I just thought that a lot of people are facing the same problems that I had faced...

YOU can customize everything from color to size, style.... All You won't know until you use it....",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sarah J,"Best messaging app I've used. It's simple, customisable, and I've never had issues with sending messages. Highly recommend. If I could make an improvement suggestion it'd be the search function. When you run a search and open an SMS from the results, it would be nice if hitting back once returned you to the search results, twice back to all SMS. Atm backing out of an SMS dismisses the search results. You have to retype the search multi times to view multi messages, which can get annoying.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Sarah Shirey,"Lots of customization and cute themes, plus you can make your own. Super easy to use. Ads on the free version are not intrusive or bothersome. I really like this app!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Pat Phillips,This sucks I don't see any reason to update to loose my colored notification. 8-11-22 Still using the app like the color options but needs better texting blocking. Getting so much spam. Not sure if adding it to block list is helping.,4

Overall I'd say this app works just as well as me previous messaging app, which came installed on my phone, butt is more feature rich.",5

Since I didn't get any news from you guys and Google Play didn't give me a refund, I've had to call my credit card and tell them that google and Chomp were frauding me and to stop the transaction and retreived my money. You guys should have taken care of your client, which you did not. I can't believe what just happened.",1
com.p1.chompsms,Sc G,unreliable. the app has crashed a couple of times and not realizing that it had not sent the text to put me in a position to not trust this app completely therefore making it unreliable will probably try something different again. Also pretty difficult just to change font size most other apps you can just pinch zoom on the message here you have to go three levels deep into the settings.,2
com.p1.chompsms,Carolyn Kimbrough,Scheduled messages through this app is the best feature ever!! Everyone I know gets a Happy Birthday text from me because I scheduled it ahead of time - and it repeats yearly! Truly wonderful - I'd give it 50 it of 10 if I could!!,5

com.p1.chompsms,GADGETS & MACHINES,Overall good. I prefer this over default sms app because it gives me option to delete in the pop up view. This helps to thrash and block unwanted messages in a single go.,5
com.p1.chompsms,David Cook,"This app shows ALL your text when writing, unlike the Google app, which is what I needed. Tried various themes to get the best contrast. Now outgoing texts are very visible white on black, but incoming texts not quite so clear white on blue, and numbers are harder to see. There are many themes to choose, so there may be a better one. I don't think you can preview them, so it's trial and error. Text messages come up on the home screen, which I like.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Trang Pham,"I had to recently switch from Textra, which I have loved and used for years, due to issues I was having with the app. I'm very happy with Chomp. You can customize everything, outside of the actual icon, which you can't change the colour of like Textra (you should be able to though!). I hated seeing the ads at the top of your msgs, so I upgraded. It was annoying, very annoying, so if you do not want to pay a small fee, you might want to reconsider. It's well worth the small fee though!",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Great app, have been using it for years. However, it is annoying now when repeatedly the last drafted message and recipient appear each time I want to send a new message. It is sooo tedious to have to edit and delete the recipient, as well as the text message. Others I know have the same problem using this app too. Please sort out this bug. I was hoping that it would be noticed and resolved long before now, but in the end I have resorted to having to write a review to get some attention to this problem. If it isn't changed soon, I'll simply have to change app.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Shayne Smith,"Was having many issues with Messages and found no fix. Found Chomp and gave it a shot. Haven't had any issues in the month I've used it. Sends pictures and texts. Only downside is that after a free trial, you get ads. Ads show up as a new conversation so they're easy to ignore. If that's all I have to deal with to get a functioning messaging app, I'm in.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Chip Hansen,"So, I was having issues with Messages, the app that came with my phone. The most serious were crashing the phone and sucking extraordinary amounts of power. There are many different msg apps to choose from. This one was rated well on many review sites so I tried it. Works like a charm. No issues. Integration with contacts and current conversations was seamless. Highly recommend",5
com.p1.chompsms,E. G.,"Great app, very customisable, easy on the eye, with quite a few useful features, like scheduled messages or blacklisting. I do miss an option to copy a selected part of a message though, its lack has severely slowed down my workflow recently. Regarding eye candy, an option to swap colours of incoming and outgoing messages while editing a theme would be helpful. Still, it's the best messaging app I've used. Thanks. EDIT: It's been almost 2 years and there's still no option to copy a part of text.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Anne MacAusland,"A whole lot better than the crummy messaging app that came with my phone. Just a little glitchy sometimes for example when I want to send a particular picture and I select the correct one, it generates another picture and attaches that to the message. And I have two contacts that for whatever reason will not pop up when I start to type their name on the search bar. But really the app itself works great",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"Very good app. Fast and stable. Used it for years, always better than stock text messaging apps, always reliable. Small glitch that's followed me last few phones: whenever I send a photo to someone, if I should click on that photo after its sent to view it, it wont expand, I'll just get a black screen. I have to click and hold and choose view photo to make it expand..this glitch will go away after 5-10 minutes and I'll be able to click normally..just a small thing.",5
com.p1.chompsms,James Field,"I've been using ChompSMS for years - since my Sony Ericsson X10i. Every now & again (usually when I change phones) I try the stock messaging app, but invariably it isn't as good as Chomp, so I come back. Last time I changed phone, Chomp seemed to stop working properly. I messaged the developer and got a quick response which fixed the problem straight away (just an Android setting I haven't seen before). All in all, I can't fault the app, especially since they fixed the slightly annoying issue where the advert would pop up where your top message was a moment before, leading to accidental advert taps - they've replaced that with a spacer now, so no more accidental taps.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've been using Chomp for years because it gives me great control over the appearance of the screen; I'm really picky about colours and such. The only thing missing, in my opinion, is per-contact notification sounds; I have to use another app to provide those. UPDATE: thanks to the developer for promptly pointing out that it is indeed possible to set per-contact notifications! I've upgraded my rating to 5 stars.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Micah M,"Love the app. Just about every aspect is customisable, the ads aren't intrusive, and it always works. Only issue I have is when searching sms, if you open a msg then go back it takes you out of the search altogether. I have to type my search in again & again to go through multiple sms. Seems like you should hit back once to return to the search results, and a second time to return to all sms. It's extremely inconvenient right now.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Jonathan Webb,"Good. It just works. Been using it for many years. I don't really know about the ""feature rich"" aspect- I chose colours for the messages and I preferred the layout iver the stock version that came on my phone.

However, for the past 48 hours I've been having issues receiving texts. Every couple hours, I need to revert back to the default messages app to receive new texts, otherwise they don't come through.

When I change my outgoing and incoming text 'font' to Italic, regardless of which bubble I pick, the last character in the text gets cut in half. Like it can't fit it all in the bubble. Question marks are particularly bad. The whole top half of the question marks gets cut off. When I switch to standard non italic characters, the problem goes away.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Len Jones,I found that the app work very well. There was a learning curve with it. but that is expected with every app that you use for the first time. What I like the most. There is a delay timer that gives you time to check your message for mistakes before sending. I program mine for five seconds. Also the home screen can be customized. In all it is a very good app. I purchased the app after a while for $3.95 I think. Here's hoping they don't screw up the app by making too many changes.,5

Thank you so much to the devs!",5
com.p1.chompsms,Karin Lualhati,I like the appearance of the app but can you improve on the following: 1. Notification. When I received a new message the notification will pop up in the middle of the screen and cover half of the screen. It also stops my videos. Can you make the notifications pop up at the top and disappear in seconds. 2. Search. I can only search my contacts name. I can't search from the conversation.,4

Still like it, the quick notification is the best one I've seen so far. Obviously chomp has been update and works more reliable now, I'll stick with it.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Sam T,"It's 5 stars when it works but recently I've been missing texts and there maybe something that's incompatible with my phone,had to default back to the stock sms ☹️ but the guys at chomp are hopefully sorting this for me. When it worked there's lots of functionality, I'll miss the scheduled text function and delay send, essential for that damned auto-correct! Lots of themes and emojis to choose from.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Kasie Dickerson,Been using it for years now love it. But just wish you could send videos.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Debbie Stark,I love this app! So many oprions and works very smoothly!,5
com.p1.chompsms,Odif,Chomp is the best I've found. I've tried others and found only more reasons to stay with Chomp. The Chomp team provides great support when asked. Thank you for a great app.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Peter Wade,I installed this as I couldn't send anything over 300kb but now I'm using chomp I can't send any pics at all. I can't find anyway of asking chomp for help. Going back to my old MMS. Wasted my money.,1
com.p1.chompsms,Charles H Zerafa,"Best messenger ever, I tried a lot of messengers and most had something that I did not like. Chomp chomps the rest to bits. I love the theming as well makes the app look pleasing to the eye. Thank you Chomp team.",5
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've used Chomp for 4 years now. Very happy with it. Quite solid. Main reason I went with it was for the pop up on the lock screen. Love being able to reply without unlocking. I had a slight issue in moving to a Galaxy S9 recently where the pop up stopped working, but an uninstall/reinstall fixed things back up. The only thing I wish it had was the option to swipe delete conversations. The long press/delete thing will always annoy me when everything else I use is a swipe to delete.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Graham Webber,"Have had this for a month now. Tried it because my old app wasn't showing callers name, just phone numbers, and i couldn't find a way to fix it. This app is really good, lots of features, lots of tweaks that can be made to improve the overall experience (not that the default needs improvement). I just paid my $3.95 to update to the pro version because it's a great. app and the authors deserve reward for a job well done. I'd give 10 stars if it were possible :)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Vladan Markovic,"Perfect, you can make it to look whatever you like. i make it like original iphone1, It is possible :)",5
com.p1.chompsms,Timothy Russell,"I'm loving it, it does everything I want in a messaging app. The security that I get using chomp is the best I've had so far",5
com.p1.chompsms,Eric - Managwan Pad8gi - Côté (Rainbow Thunderbird),"Edit: oh, that sucks they restricted the API so much. Thanks for the info :) Unobtrusive, efficient resource usage. RCS support would be awesome Edited",5
com.p1.chompsms,Cat,"I do like this messaging app but I have just a couple issues. One is that I'm having issues with my carrier converting long texts to MMS lately so when I did the split text option to get around it, it even split my short texts just because I added emojis. Also I've had messaging delays even tho the no delay option is selected. Probably due to my carrier but you know, still worth mentioning. Features seem good overall tho.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Jerry Chrane-Shafer,Fine app. Only thing to make it better is delayed/time send.,4
com.p1.chompsms,JEANNINE INGRAM,Up until a few months or so it was good. Now I've been noticing some of my texts do not go through,4
com.p1.chompsms,todd vanderhoof,Works well. Like that it's very customizable. So far so good.,5
com.p1.chompsms,Kevin B. Hicks (hicksey),I've been using this app for years my favorite by far first app I download when I get a new phone love how much I can customize it to fit my needs,5
com.p1.chompsms,Hillarious Hilario Kasaquer Mwansa,"The font was too big and even after reducing it from 20 to 6, it wasn't changing; only the home page reduced, the actual messages didn't. Secondly, there is too much space between the message bubbles and the sides when you check the pics. I've given it 4★ because it's still a brilliant app.",4
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"EDIT: thanks for the reply! I've also noticed that chomp no longer shows information on my home screen when I receive a message when it is locked (it used to show the contact and a few words of the message). it possible that we will get a feature like Samsung's Chat Type? So that we can use data to see when messages are read and when contacts are typing? Would be great to finally have this, I'd hate to switch to the stock sms.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Willie B. Hardigan,"I really like it. To be totally honest, I like the functionality of Google Messages a bit more but the trade off is that their app gets huge. The cache grows to multiple gigs. But I really do like Chomp too. I wish it did more to automatically accommodate attachments, even if that means compressing even more to ensure it fits within the confines.",4
com.p1.chompsms,Stephanie Nugent,No matter what I do there is no notification sound when texts come through. The most basic thing a texting app should do is make a sound when you receive a message. Update: after deleting and redownloading the app a second time the notifications are now working. Very pleased with the app overall.,4
com.p1.chompsms,Charlie G.,Can't get audio notificatios to work???,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I like this app. I don't have the MMS issue like with the ""default"" texting app - it actually lets me respond to group MMS messages without breaking them. One thing the ""default"" texting app did that this doesn't is when i am sharing an image or sharing a website externally into the app and i type someone's name, it normally brings up the conversation, which is helpful. This one doesn't do that, but it's not a dealbreaker.",5
com.p1.chompsms,Gene Foley,"A fairly good app. Better than most. Needs better gifs, emojis Last word of text too close to send button. Results in accidentally sending before ready. Hard to edit last word without sending message. Oct 2022. Had to delete. Contacts with IPhone could not receive texts. Now cannot reinstall on Note 20.",3
com.p1.chompsms,Ned Schuster,They texted me at 2am looking for a review. Really? 2am. Get real. It's a decent program but the fact that they have no consideration for the time of day or nigjt they texted begging for a review is very disturbing.,3
com.p1.chompsms,A Google user,"I've tried many sms apps and this is one of the best. Highly customisable, attractive, smooth and clean. Well worth buying the paid-for ad-free version. The only problem is that sending a message to multiple people at once becomes an absolute mess. This is a big problem for me. I would love it if this could be worked on. The second thing I would like to see is to be able to lock an entire conversation instead of just one message.",4

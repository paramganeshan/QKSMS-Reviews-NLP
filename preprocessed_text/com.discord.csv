com.discord,Couch,"Overall really like the app but this new font is truly awful. It would be one thing if I just found it displeasing to look at but genuinely I and other people with reading disorders are struggling to read because all of the letters look too similar to each other and the spacing is very tight, making it perfect for messing with dyslexic and aphasic people. Thanks for that. I wish I could use OpenDyslexic on my phone and in my apps.",3
com.discord,Tiena Johnson,"I have been a user for the app since 2018 or 2017. I have loved it but there has been so many bugs. Usually when they want to change something up, they is usually some type of bug that comes with it ~ especially with audio/ video callsüòÅ. Advice: stop fixing things that are already working. Current bug: app is unable to pick up audio. It is not an issue with my headphones or devices (mobile and computer). Other applications work perfectly with audio, etc. But still happening after 2 weeks.",2
com.discord,Duckz_,"I wish we had the mobile version back on the phones. Then you changed it to the pc version. Not a fan, it doesnt look very nice on phones. For some odd reason, i will maybe download an image from.. google, for example. Then when i would like to send it to a friend/group it doesnt appear. This started recently. There is a bug(?) where it takes longer for images and videos to load, I'm not exactly sure why this is occuring. Happens with texts too. Other than these things, its a nice app.üëç",2
com.discord,Damaso Reyes,"The new update has ruined sending images. Recently, as of the last few days, there was an update to how images are selected. It has lead to massive latency when posting an image. Once selecting the palette for images there is an immediate drop in performance and closing out of the palette takes close to 20 seconds. It may be the program is trying to load all images at max resolution at once. I can't think of what else would be causing it.",2
com.discord,Kayla Gray,"Almost every single time I tap a specific notification, the app will not take me to that server and channel. Rather, it will open to the last channel I was in when I closed the app previously. What is the point of notifications then, if I can click on the one I want to go to first? Also, images never work right half the time; they appear halfway off the screen and way too large.",1
com.discord,Aureus Cordiale,"If you can use an alternate app, use it. Discord is utterly unreliable and unstable. Problems with it are varied and constant. It is quite impressive that they manage to make it worse with each update. Yet, they want you to pay for Nitro just to use animated emojis and send files more than 8MB. Hard pass. Quite possibly the worst app. I have to constantly relaunch it, or it'll just try connecting without actually doing anything. This happens often.",1
com.discord,Melein Brueck,"Everything was going great until recently. Now I'm having issues every time I try to upload an image. It lags so bad and takes several minutes to go through the process of realizing I've selected an image and uploading it, and it takes even longer if I try to type a message with it, and half the time the app just stops responding and has to close and the other half I get fed up and close out of it myself and try again when I reopen it. This happens regardless of the file size. Please fix this.",3
com.discord,DJ D00MSHYER,"The app was literally perfect before. Now its super buggy with the recent update. Whenever I want to send an image, it takes ages to load the photos, and even longer to send them, sometimes crashing the app entirely. And when it doesn't, when I scroll through the photos they end up looping, so I have to open it, which ends up being even Longer.",1
com.discord,Smol Lemon,"It's a nice app, easy to use. But with the newest update, the blue "" (number of) new messages since (time last checked)"" bar pops up at the top of the screen everytime someone types a message even if you are currently reading it, while the channels messages will randomly move the words upwards as if you scrolled up a bit when a new message is sent every so often. Edit: Now the number of people online doesn't show correctly in the server members section Edit 2: It does this on any wifi or data",3
com.discord,a random [brony],"1) All of the buttons on the UI are gone. Like the graphics for them. Such as the different tabs, the call buttons, everything. It's just the background color. It looks like it hasn't loaded. It makes it virtually impossible to use, because you'll accidentally click video call at 4:43 am 2) You can no longer send screenshots from other discord chats. It's so annoying, cause my friends don't wanna download a file just to see a pic. 3) Unless I close the app, it messes up my music after a call",2
com.discord,Paul,"Update: Fix the video freeze issue! Your Android app is suffering. Latest Update has some design flaws. In VC, when tapping user's pic, it doesn't always work even if you long-press. When the volume adjustment pops up, you can no longer drag to slide up or down. You have tap somewhere on that line to make an adjustment, which means you're not always able to turn them all the way down or up. Now when you select ""Voice Connected"" in notifications it bring you to VC chat, not list of people.",1
com.discord,Perseus Matlock,"I've been using Discord for years with no issue. These recent mobile updates have been pretty bad, though. The newest update is bugged so that whenever I open the app, it gets stuck on one channel I was in and won't show me anything else. It won't even display new messages sent in that channel. I can click on different channels and send messages on them, I just can't see what I'm replying to or what I'm even typing. It also keeps showing me an ad for Nitro EVERY time I open the app.",3
com.discord,PotatoBear,"Almost everything works great, I especially love the all black background (wouldn't mind if it got added to iOS though). The reason I gave this 3 stars is because when I try to join a VC, it just does not work at all. I can't hear or be heard. Basically the only thing that works in terms of VCs is the text chat built into the Voice Channel. I would somewhat understand if they don't work because I am on the beta program, but even after leaving the program it still had the same problems as before.",3
com.discord,Ja,"I tried to hold out and think the update would eventually improve, but that's sadly not the case. Watching videos is a hassle, as if you open it full screen, there's a coinflip on if it'll actually play. If it doesn't, you have to watch it small. The app itself feels sluggish. If many emotes are used, the app slows WAY down. And every time I open the app after long periods of not using it, it'll repeatedly open a specific DM EACH TIME. On to of that, clearing pings has also been a nightmare.",2
com.discord,oozy,"Discord, your app is absolutely horrible. You've somehow changed a good chatting app into straight up trash. Every time I call someone, I can't hear them at all no matter who it is and it's very buggy. Secondly, every time I try to chat right after opening another tab it does ""Connecting..."" and then when I try to type it won't go through. Lastly, I can't send any new images that aren't loaded. All of your 'updates' suck. Change it back to what it was before.",2
com.discord,Sophie Ehrsam,"I have to rate it one star due to the unholy amount of lag that now occurs when I attempt to send a picture. It crashes the app and it never used to do that, or it stalls the whole app and I'm not able to do anything for at least 5 minutes. It's like the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This also doesn't include the bizarre glitches that are involved when sending DMs, such as messages stacking under one user, messages not showing immediately even if the banner showed for them.",1
com.discord,JamesonDistrict,"Practically unusable anymore. I dont know what they did or thought was a good idea but it completely broke the app. Cant send videos or messages without it taking minutes, gif links get broken when you try to copy them, they made it harder to get videos/photos from your phone to send (newer ones don't show up half the time), and the app crashes everything time you get back on it - especially on a call or while watching a video. Had to reinstall it 5 separate times to get it to work again.",1
com.discord,Xephorium,"For years, discord has been one of my favorite apps. But after this year's update, it's become borderline unusable on Android. The switch to React Native was a mistake. 20% of the time, the app just crashes on launch. Long-pressing messages to emoji react has become a gambling game, sometimes working and sometimes doing nothing at all. File upload is a glitchy mess and video playback is broken, unloading or playing two versions simultaneously whenever you hit fullscreen. I miss the old app.",1
com.discord,JoJo Slammer (JoJoSlammer),"I love this app. I really do. However the lag on it is absolutely unbearable sometimes. There are times when it's a second or two delay of sending a message after clicking the send button, or text appearing in the text box a second or two after I type it. Just interaction delays in general tbh. Poor optimization, maybe?",3
com.discord,theaxolotlgod,"PLEASE stop ruining the image search. Please. Is it really that hard to leave something alone when it works just fine? Do you have to modify it every update? Really? Just let me see my images! Don't take up a third of the image search area with boxes and options I do not care about and never will. Also, it's not auto updating anymore either. Have to restart the app to get newly downloaded/creates media files to show up.",1
com.discord,Grant Gillum,"The new updates have been absolutely ridiculous. Images and videos sent by others take a longer time to load now. I can't even send images or videos as the app will freeze for fifteen seconds and crash whenever I try to hit send. Even before that, it takes nearly a minute to load whatever's stored on my phone, and another minute for anything I select to load. Even if it starts sending, it takes over a minute to send a 300kb image on good Wi-Fi, then it crashes. Discord, you've broken your app.",1
com.discord,Truitt,"Not terrible, a few issues here and there but they don't affect me too much. However an issue is an issue. Gifs and Videos don't always load and it causes me to restart the app just to see it load. Also, a small detail but gets on my nerves, everytime I put "":)"" in text, it gets converted to üôÇ. I don't like that, at all. Not to mention it removed the setting to turn off that feature from my phone. I'd like that setting back please. And fix the issues with gofs and videos please.",3
com.discord,Vidian,"There have been a ton of problems with discord recently, and it's been going downhill with each update. One of the recent issues I've ran into is one of the buttons covering the edit button for changing your banner. I've tried refreshing, reinstalling, and even restarting my phone, and lo and behold, nothing worked. I'm unsure if this is just me, but hopefully this gets fixed soon.",1
com.discord,Kem Bio,"I understand the UI transition, does resemble the PC version more overall. What I don't get is how your team managed to make this app run worse than it already did with the latest update. This new Discord version has had problems when it came to sharing media, but it's just so bad how long it takes to send a single image now with the latest update available for my device, freezing up and draining battery just trying to do so.",2
com.discord,YT_Lexi fox _,"Have been using this app for over 4 years. It's very much an all in one when it comes to screen sharing & playing with other friends. Have it be new or even old it's nice to have, especially if you don't want others to have your number. Recent down sides have been the non stop updates, having mobile notifications no longer show after each update is very annoying. Causing me to have to update at least Avery 2 weeks to a month. Not to mention sending images or video files via mobile has worsened.",3
com.discord,Haylee,"They have removed the ""nitro classic"" with basic. I bought classic for a year and it automatically got switched to basic. I have not even half the perks I paid for. Absolutely ridiculous to just switch users like this. And even more so to have this ""basic"" option. Why not keep classic AND have a basic option. Its a horrendous downgrade, and there's not a way for me to get my money back. I wish I could.",1
com.discord,nursie,"Overall, this app is really great, I would have rated it 5 stars, but, there's three problems with it. Number one, the new layout is extremely laggy. Number two, the whole having to pick from the files to upload a image is too complicated. Number three, the moderation bans people unfairly. Please fix these problems. Overall, it is good.",2
com.discord,Striker,"discord has been an amazing way to get together with friends, and has consistently stayed pretty good overall. the only issues i have with it, are that streaming on mobile consistently doesn't have audio regardless of settings and what i stream to. it's not just an issue on my end either, as my friends have also had this same thing happen to them. aside from that, it's an amazing app to use and have fun with in any regard",4
com.discord,INCOGNITO,"Its like this app gets worse with every update. Most notably as of now, the file picker doesn't work right. The hang up function is also broken and often doesn't work when I try to hang up. Then, the video in the video calls constantly freeze, ridiculously. There is more but this is just off the top of my head. Dogshit app.",1
com.discord,Mari Leigh,"this is the buggiest ive ever seen discord mobile. not only has it been difficult to manage server settings when it keeps closing, but also cameras freezing in VCs, barely being able to select a message to complete an action without it being in a very certain spot (like trying to work a broken charger so you can charge your phone), and over all having the issue of selecting things without it being in a certain spot on your screen! there's so much wrong and it seems to just be getting worse üòì",2
com.discord,Grace,"App usually works well, but this last update has made attaching photos a nightmare. The preview images in the attach UI don't update consistently anymore, and when you try to attach an image, it sometimes lags the app so badly that you have to wait 30s to be able to do anything. Then when you're finally able to start typing, it's still pretty laggy.",2
com.discord,Toy,"I used to love this app, it was a great way of talking to friends. However, recently, Idk what happened, but it's done nothing but get Worse to use. At first It was just more annoying to send pics that werent my most recent. But now? I have to fight it to send any pics at all, and i have to close and reopen the app like 3 times everytime I send a single pic. Its a nightmare. Its also just become incredibly buggy. word limit is cutting me off, but, recently, it feels like it's becoming unusable.",1
com.discord,pascal,"How is it possible for an app to get more janky the more it's updated? As long as I can remember (since 2017) the mobile app has only gotten less usable. Just recently the image selector doesn't update with new images. Also, you can no longer scroll down to view old images, after a certain point it loops the most recent ones. The entire app grinds to a halt after about a minute of use. EVERY action lags. The service is amazing, but the mobile app is horrendous, and third party is against TOS...",1
com.discord,Tpir04,"I appreciate the bugs that have been fixed and the features that have been added back to the app since the August 2022 update, such as emote names turning blue again and, most recently, the timestamps reappearing for messages more than two days old. However, I have encountered a new bug. Whenever I type two regional indicator emotes back to back, no spaces, the app auto-replaces it with a flag emote. This is incredibly inconvenient for me, and I wish it was re-evaluated and fixed!",4
com.discord,Ghost,"I've used this app for years with no issues, but for a few weeks I haven't been getting a single notification outside of the app. Everything is set up right, everything is turned on, I don't have the servers I want notifs from muted, it just stopped working one day. It's very frustrating and makes responding to things difficult, if this gets fixed I'll give the app five stars or something, idk how this works",2
com.discord,aly day,it's been a pain to use this app ever since that one update from a few months ago. it's slow and buggy and it has been for months!! i thought they were trying to fix the issues on android but yet every patch it seems to get worse. i'm just disappointed. i love this app because it's the easiest way for me to talk with all of my friends and my partner all in one place. but it's really starting to annoy me when the lag is so bad i can barely even type sometimes üò≠ i really hope it can be fixed soon,2
com.discord,Anomalocaris,"I used to think this app was one of the most well optimized messaging apps for mobile devices. However, since the UI change all that optimization and functionality is just gone. Messages often take way longer to load, just switching channels or typing can outright freeze the app. And recently ive been having issues downloading videos while in discord. When I download them the file is unplayable and impossible to post elsewhere. Really hope these issues get resolved.",1
com.discord,Ian Ethan,"Pic uploads have suddenly become extremely slow after the last update, to the point of crashing my phone. Prior, they were quick and smooth. CPU reports as being 100-percented on both clock and bandwidth during photo selection and upload, freezing over a full minute sometimes. Other times, it can go 5+ minutes without any sign of progress. You need to reoptimize your photo uploads. Thanks.",2
com.discord,Gumgetter Gaming,"This app used to be great, but ever since the recent full revamp, a lot of things have been breaking. Videos fail to load and require a restart. File upload times have increased for no reason. And, now all of the videos that I download through the app are missing their thumbnail/preview image. All of this stuff has started happening between updates, with seemingly no fixes at all.",3
com.discord,cuppy57,"This app hasn't given me trouble until the most recent update. I seem to be missing a fair amount of icons, such as the upload media button, the notification that tells me if my friends are online, or even the icon to pull up side menus (They still function). It kind of keeps getting worse, everytime I log on something else is missing.",3
com.discord,kajemi2,"This is my third revision of this review, and I unfortunately can't take it any lower than 1 star. App freezes up and lags constantly. Newly downloaded photos no longer appear to be uploaded without resetting the entire app. App drains the phone's battery and causes the phone to become quite hot. There are so many issues with this app now that did not used to be here. It has only gotten worse over the last several months. What happened?",1
com.discord,Richard Tapia,"Great app, bad mic experience. It's a great messaging app and works amazing as that. For voice calling on mobile though, it's been pretty terrible. I'm using a One Plus 6T and I have had to rely on the desktop application to talk to people. I have to yell in order for anyone to hear me speak and even then, the audio cuts out. Update: mic is still pretty bad. Nitro is cool though, collecting stickers is pretty fun",3
com.discord,archer s,"Discord has become aweful. It used to be amazing and the only way that I would message people, but now its laggy, it doesnt always give me notifications, and just looks bad. Also, if you take a picture with discord (if it lets you), it saves to your camera roll and theres no setting to turn that off. For my bf, whenever we're on the phone, it constantly lags and lags and lags, and my camera always freezes. It's not a wifi issue, it used to be just fine.",1
com.discord,Joe Cool,"For the past few weeks, every time I download a video (regardless of format) it becomes corrupt, and is completely unplayable outside of Discord itself. At first I thought it was just bad files, but I tested it by uploading a normal video and sending it to my brother, and when he downloaded it he got the same corruption bug.",2
com.discord,SharkieBae,"Honestly. I used to love this app. Used it all the time. Now it won't even let me send messages. I've tried restarting my phone. Uninstalling and reinstalling. And just, everything. It always just puts ""Can not send message. Hold for options."" All I get is the resend or delete. I've resent messages over and over and OVER again. Nothing. Please get this fixed and I'll change my review.",1
com.discord,Autumn Word,"I don't know what happened, if it's the new updates or it's just broken for me, but my call button doesn't show, along with, FaceTime, send, stickers, gift, the options along the bottom when looking at contacts. And some other features. Photos take longer to send, it glitches when trying to send photo after photo. Takes a while just to show a new photo I just took.",3
com.discord,e r i k a,"Can't play downloaded videos. When I download videos from this app, I go to my gallery, and the duration is shown as ""0:00"" and the thumbnail is blank. When I try to play the video, I get an error message. Pictures and GIFs download fine, though. Please fix this bug. It's never done this before, and it's getting frustrating.",1
com.discord,Anna Grace Gainey,"Still getting used to the new terrible and inconsistent UI. I can't just scroll to send an image, now I have to go back to my photo app and send it there. On top of that, wherever I send an image from somewhere else, all of the text on the screen just grows outrageously large and is unusable. I have to restart my phone to reset it. I can no longer see who's speaking in voice and a large box shows up on my screen when I share my screen and it won't go away. Bring back the old Discord. Pls.",3
com.discord,V/H/S,"borderline unusable at this point. I don't know what caused it but sending and loading images is completely broken. Just opening the tab to send images causes my phone to lag aggressively, sending images is unresponsive for a moment, and then the actual process of them being sent takes minutes. Sometimes videos or files that are absolutely beneath the absurd file size limit for standard users won't send for being ""too large"".",1
com.discord,James Tompsett,"So. There is a lot to go over. I'm not sure if it is my device, but at random, Discord will completely crash. Right before that, lag starts up. Not only that, if I try to open my photos through discord to, say, set a new profile picture, discord will close. I can't access all my photos through the app because it'll crash.",3
com.discord,Robert Adams,"I would honestly give this a higher rating, but the last update made a new bug. In addition to a new emote feature where emotes appear in vc by a user, it completely crashes on mobile. While my desktop friends spam it, the app completely goes out of control on my end. Keeps throwing me in and our of vc, I can't turn down the volume, and can't even bring up the home button on my screen. Just have to ride it out until I can fully shut down discord.",1
com.discord,Justin McNutt,"Great but not Perfect There are a few little things that are annoying about Discord - and I should emphasize that they are little things - but for example, if I switch from the direct message list to the list of server channels, it will automatically select the last channel I was in AND MARK IT AS READ. Overall, though, Discord is still the best chat app out there, in my opinion, which is why I bothered to write this review.",4
com.discord,Pete Ochoa,"After looking through the app and testing to see if there are anymore bugs that have hindered my experience while using the app, I can say that the updates have changed a lot. I think the app is pretty good where it's at and I hope it can keep getting better. Also I see that the issue with discord not conforming to the aspect ratio of my app window has been fixed which is great.",4
com.discord,GreenBeanWater,"Ever since they tried to copy paste the iOS version to android, it's just been a complete disaster. And every new update that comes up afterwards just breaks something else without feeling like anything has been fixed. Currently, i have to close the app completely to see pictures that i just downloaded, the display will glitch at certain times, and the keyboard will just randomly flip up after a video ends or i interact with something. Just go back to android version",1
com.discord,Gordish,"It's a great app for what it is. That being said there are some system problems such as: discord camera continuously loading at times. It's very annoying because you constantly need to refresh to get the video to show. Another highly annoying thing is that it is very difficult for me to mute someone. Imagine joining a call, hearing people talk but you can't hear what they're saying because the music bot is so loud",3
com.discord,Dark Disasters,"I refrained from saying anything cause there were already so many telling you that your mobile app, since the major update in summer, has been absolute garbage, but I'm getting to a point where it is just a struggle to even use anymore. I have experienced at LEAST 1 hard crash each day if I'm lucky, it is extremely laggy every few 15-30 minutes, I can only post 1 image at a time, gifs take a while to send/load, I constantly disconnect from voice chats. All this after that huge update in summer.",1
com.discord,treydog1357,"Like many other reviews have pointed out, this app is absolutely awful lately. I can't understand what caused such a horrible optimization that would go unfixed for months. It's slow to change channels and dms or to do anything really. It automatically opens profiles or videos upon opening the app which is incredibly annoying. Trying to send a photo is unbearable, and has even gotten worse since yesterday, being extremely slow and even freezing. I would say more if the character limit was bigger",1
com.discord,Alyx Aizawa,This app is wonderful and easy to use. I've meet some of my best friends here in discord. Update: as of late discord has been absolutely horrendous to use. Every time I press the plus button to share photos my discord crashes or lags horrendously. The only way to fix this is by force closing the app and to not click that button every again. As someone who sends a lot of photos to my friends its quite frustrating. Plus sharing photos from outside the app will make the text infinitely smaller so.,1
com.discord,FritterMouse,"After the barrage of updates, the app consistently crashes, i can no longer share audio when i stream my screen on mobile, the UI Is obnoxious and isn't customizable In size so It's just way to large and clunky, sending images just doesn't work, it keeps altering to samsung fitness for some reason?? It's not very accessible any more, Just makes me want to move back to like- skype or something. Blegh.",3
com.discord,Jeremy Brookley,"Guys, I'm not sure what happened, if a cat walked across the keyboard and released this version before it was ready but you broke everything. Videos don't show video anymore, just a black screen, text doesn't scroll with what you're typing properly on long messages, favorite emotes disappeared, you can no longer long press on things without restarting the app, etc. You need to fix these things or roll back cuz it's barely usable right now Update: currently broken - pictures/videos won't load",1
com.discord,Sakagai,"Discord is actually one of the only ways I talk to people.. Mainly because of how good looking the app is and how easy it is to use.. Daily conveniences such as sending important images to friends is quick and easy to do with just the tap of a button. (Unless you have to browse your images which include another app.) Discord is one of the apps I wish more were like/similar to.. I rarely experience bugs, but the ones that occur can always be fixed by refreshing the app (closing and re-opening it)",5
com.discord,Hhhh,"the latest update of the app compresses images, and thats fine but i would like an option to turn it off. i tried using the switch that pops up when it sends but it doesnt work. sometimes i like to send art, videos, images, etc in the highest quality but discord just compresses it. if you could turn that off thatd be super helpful as it gets pretty annoying if you cant really tell what a video is due to the severe lack of quality!! thank you for reading my inquiry",2
com.discord,Ali Arif,"I love discord, but the mobile experience is atrocious. The video chat constantly freezes when I'm just trying to chill and talk with the boys, and the touch controls during the calls are extremely unresponsive. It's not my phone, which has the newest snapdragon chip, nor my internet since I'm right next to the router. When the software experience improves, I'll improve my rating. For now, if you can stick with the desktop app, stay with that! Edit: to respond below: still occurs on cell & wifi",2
com.discord,Claire K,"Recently swapped from apple to android. The performance on android is HORRIFIC in comparison. There are so many performance, stability, and bug issues. Marking me as online when my phone is locked or the app is in background should not be marking me as online, marking messages I've read as unread, the app freezing and then completely refreshing itself, not giving me any notifications. It's really annoying and inconvenient. Would rather use the awful web browser. Yikes.",1
com.discord,Unknown Chicken,"I can't believe it, but Discord seems to be bug-free and enjoyable to use again! My main complaint is that not enough time seems to be spent in beta finding bugs - with each update I have to gamble on whether Discord will still be usable. While I appreciate the new features added in each update, the fact that they come with a plethora of bugs makes me less willing to update the app on a regular basis. However, this app remains my preferred method of communication with friends and fellow gamers.",4
com.discord,David McNamara,As of a couple months ago all video calls when running full screen freeze exactly at the 30 second mark video bitrate 0. When not full screen it's ok. Need to go back to the video chat (video small window) then swipe right to full screen again but the video freezes again at 30 seconds. Audio through all this is fine. Will probably bump rating if/when issue is resolved.,1
com.discord,Nezha The Immortal,"Could be better, though everytime this app updates there seems to be some ill-omened bug that's not far behind. Recently, I've stumbled upon an issue with the ""Tupperbox"" Bot, an entity that allows you to create faux accounts for fun and enjoyment. Up until just a few days ago, it was working just perfectly until it wasn't. There is a command, ‚ÄùTul!list‚Äù That brings up a list of your registered proxies, and to my surprise the buttons below the list used to navigate the list no longer exist. (?)",3
com.discord,Gerard Desjardins,"Discord just works. I don't know how it, but it's great. Wanna stream a game to your friends while watching your friends stream while playing a game on a different stream? No problem. How can do much video exist on one computer? It's easy to create a server and it'll take a couple hours of exploring to get good at managing channels and creating roles, but it works and it works well. The audio controls are super helpful. Key binds allow ultra customization.",5
com.discord,Annmarie Saldana,"Video calling freezes after a couple of seconds..the other person I was calling couldn't see me on their screen and it was black on their screen with a loading icon. And it never fixed. It continued to stay that way. As for me, I could see but on my screen it froze, so I could no longer see..but I could only hear them. Edit: not just video call problems but also problems with me not getting message notifications sometimes. Fix this app!",1
com.discord,Docchi,"The main problem here is the image selector and the image thumbnails that show up before sending. There are still loads of other problems, but the main thing to focus on is the ability to send images without using massive amounts of ram to both select and show image thumbnails prior to sending. please optimize it :(",1
com.discord,Anthony C,"I've hade the app for a while, but for some reason one of the channels was really laggy. I have two accounts, my main is perfectly fine, it's not laggy or anything. But my second is supper laggy, I just wanted to see a video that looked cool, but NOO the app wants to lag really hard when I try to see it. The other channels are fine but this one in particular is supper laggy. Edit: Now it won't let me do anything, when I go to a different channel it stays the same.",3
com.discord,Jack Skudlarek,"This is a virus. I uninstalled it in every insensible capacity on my PC yet I'll still see spare instances that reinstall EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL OVER AGAIN if I dare so much as glance at it improperly. It runs 24/7 and is unable to close so the numerous audio issues are unfixable ""just turn it off and"" its on the phentosecond I touch the power button and it's booting up to its last load, aka dumping me in the same call/stream/audio and video issues. If only I could restart it, but I can't.",1
com.discord,Gabriel Blaylock,"The new update is horrible. It's made looking back at past messages impossible. I'm not able to go back to a pin and simply read from that pin down. I have to hit the 'load more messages' button which changes where I was at on the feed causing me to need to scroll to find my spot. If I want to properly read something start to end on discord I have to hit a load button repeatedly and scroll around hoping I can find where I left off. And no, just like with everyone else, not a 'connection issue'.",4
com.discord,Dustin Wolf13,"Discord is cool, I've been using it for years(even before this account but this recent update really isn't my thing. The previous had me able to just click on the picture instead of having to ""trust this domain"" every time, and I'm not with the just seeing it. And the format is all weird, the text in the chat is significantly smaller than in my text box, the border, the spacing isn't fun, The new ""Friend nickname"" is fun but I'm not with anything else, I'd rather not have it updated at all :(",2
com.discord,sugarsomg,"the last several updated have made the app borderline unusable for me. My friends with apple devices are having virtually no issues, but for me and my other Android friends have been having so many issues. All UI icons are completely gone, I have to open my files to find any images, and a myriad of other issues that I dont have the space to list. Its not an internet problem either, strictly an app issue. Discord really needs to do something about this, bc this is just unacceptable at this point.",2
com.discord,Vince,"Icons are missing for channels, share buttons, and in a variety of other places after the most recent update. Closing and restarting the app does not fix the issue. The buttons I have encountered this on are still functional as long as you remember what spot does what, but the lack of visual indicators makes navigation difficult.",2
com.discord,Ace Timer,"The buttons used to call people on this app need to be hidden behind another button, like the three dots button, over 10 times there have been accidental calls in the past month or so, and it's not just me, even my friends have had accidental calls, it's extremely embarrassing and it could be worse if the other person picks up and you didn't mean to call them. When are you going to provide more security for these buttons, even water will push the button, it just happened to me right now.",1
com.discord,Corbin W.,"This app used to be fine, I'm a user from 2018 and 2019 - but the new updates have been messing it up so bad. It says I have misssed messages all the time and I have to check them? One time I opened the app and it messed up saying I had missed messages from every channel from years ago and it woukdnt go away so I had to check each one. Recently I cant even send a picture without it lagging or opening up two different links.. or completely closing the app out. Fix your damn app.",1
com.discord,Lt.Cdr. Chunk Chungus,"I don't know what happened, but about 4 months back, us Android users got screwed over in an update. Especially as of late, when I try to share a video that's only 3.03MB it says I cannot share the video because it's more than 8MB. Guys, I don't know what you did, but please go back to a previous version until you get this patched. I have an apple purely for testing purposes, and that exact same file was sent through with no issue.",1
com.discord,Joe Schmidt,"Fine when it works, but recently have only been able to view a single channel on the app. No support from discord development. Clearing caches from the app is greyed out, clearing from the apps on the phone doesn't help. All works fine from the web. It's a bug and no way I can find to get around it. Updating my review in response to the vendor reply. They gave me an email support that if I send useful information to, it says it's rejected. Their email support is not accepting requests.",1
com.discord,Cassie G,"I would give this 5 stars but I have a HUGE glitch to report. When I screen share, when I try to end it because I don't need to anymore, Discord freezes and I have to close the app and open it again, have it tell me it's not working, manually close it, and then it'll work. One time it was so bad I had to force stop it. I love using this but screen sharing just does not work. Please fix!",3
com.discord,Gage B.,"This app sucks now. There are so many glitches and annoyances that have been introduced into the latest updates. Video playback doesn't work most of the time, sending images is awful and laggy (it is not my internet connection, all of my friends have these two issues), and the app starts from where the last notification you clicked on took you to *everytime*. The Discord app used to be acceptable but it has just gone downhill recently.",1
com.discord,Shane the Freestyler,"Ever since the mobile UI overhaul, Discord has been horrendously slow! What used to be fairly snappy, if crowded UI has been replaced with a cleaner, yet unresponsive UI that at the worst of times will act as if a surver is empty whenever I switch to a different one! It makes navigation an outright slog if I want to quickly browse around like I used to. It also no longer remembers which channel in a server I was last in when switching.",1
com.discord,James Bradley,"Chat channels keep disappearing EXCEPT the last one I was using. Happens at least once a day. Have to delete & reinstall the app to get the groups back. Running on Android 13. Been an issues since mid/late August. Had to downgrade my review a star to get any response from support after trying to contact them initially. After giving me the run around for another month trying to make it seem like I was doing something wrong, support just said it's a known issue & that's all. Issue still persists.",1
com.discord,Streak The Hedgehog,"This app is pretty great! It's just that it can sometimes be VERY inconsistent, and the gui bugs out a lot.

So please, fix this app's performance issues and gui inconsistencies! Love ya!",4

I have uninstalled and reinstalled app; and did not have this problems until updating app.",3
com.discord,Jacob Riley,"Highly frustrating mobile client. The voice chat feature consistently fails to with with Bluetooth devices. This has been a known issue since 2020. A quick Google search reveals multiple users having this problem and 0 solutions I could find. It's a decent app for texting friends. A crapshoot right now for voice chatting. I have no idea why the devs haven't fixed a critical 2 year old issue, but common consensus online is that discord support won't help. A voice app without voice is useless.",2
com.discord,Ronan Flynn (Hidatsu),"Pretty good chat service! I've been using discord for a few years now (I think) and it's been a lovely experience. I've spent a lot of time both with a free account and a premium account. There isn't much quality lost on the free account, as everything has a lovely function ability. Paying the sub only gives you more boosts to performance and a few extra features, but fundamentally everything useful is free. They are always on top of disruptions in service, too.",5
com.discord,Fawful- 16,"The app is great, I've made so many friends! However, there's one issue I'd like to address and that's the roles that allow the color change of a name.

com.discord,FoxGirl,"This is an updated review. Ever since Discord sent out updates some time ago the more pressing issues have not been resolved. Images don't update in real time - app restart required. Sometimes messages don't load on time despite getting them as a popup - either wait, respond, or restart required. If you respond before it loads, it shows the user that is DM'd sent your message. Sometimes it takes a very long time to properly connect for the UI to load. I know these issues are not my connection.",2
com.discord,SSStylish Moonborne,"Absolute garbage since a few updates ago. Keyboard randomly pops up for no reason and can't be sent away without force closing the app. App is overall way laggier than it once was. I hear this is due to a true native Android version being replaced with a weird iOS converted version, and if that's true, shame on you for such laziness, discord. Fix this. EDIT: This all continues months later. The only thing that's been fixed is the text scrolling bug. Disappointing. Yes it's updated.",1
com.discord,Penelope K,"The new updates are ruining everything. We didn't need the new layout, or the glitchy profile, or the gallery change. I don't want to reset Discord everytime I want to send a new image. Discord is impossible to use atp it's so annoying please put it back to normal. The webhook update ruined so much things too. You changed things that didn't need to be changed.",1
com.discord,Tycon Xon,"The app was fine until like the middle of 2022. Everything was just so much worse; selecting an image is terrible, searching for an emoji is terrible, you can't even preview custom emojis anymore, recently the app just slows to a crash everytime a take a picture, and generally everything is slow and broken. I don't understand the need for the changes, the app worked fine in early 2022 and before that.",2
com.discord,Bryan (Pipeline929),"So discord as a whole I love but the Android app (at least what I'm experiencing) is a bit messy. Watching streams are a bit hard and for me personally on the s22 ultra I seem to not be able to use Bluetooth headphones in a voice channel on a server. Everything I Google says to go to the voice and video settings and change my audio device but my ""voice and video"" option just says voice and there is no option of audio device. App is up to date and been reinstalled but no change.",2
com.discord,Milky Moone,"Was good until they changed their UI, it absolutely sucks to do anything like screensharing because it just crashes. UI looks better-ish but there was really no need for change except they wanted more ""simplicity"". Turning off screenshare causes the app to crash, and its been months. It needs to be fixed. All of it needs to be fixed. Discord is nothing but a buggy mess nowadays.",2
com.discord,Adelina D,"Every time I open the app, my messages won't appear right away and just says ""connecting"" up top. I have to close the app completely and restart it.

com.discord,Lulu Howell,"Was originally a 5. Then a 4, a few weeks ago. Now its a 3. All of my previous problems still exist with other people sending messages I sent, and just generally an unfriendly and cluttered ui.

com.discord,Ojo,"I like it, it's my type of app in alot of ways. It's like any texting app but with more ways to expand. Definitely one of my favorite ""Social Medias"" you could say. As of recently though I've faced a few problems. Every single thing in the app that's supposed to show an image or icon is showing nothing but blank (such as status or friend list or dms or pings) and the mobile keyboard occupies the entire message box sometimes.",3
com.discord,Lee Flowers (Chickynugs),"Update: App was finally stable a week ago, though still buggy on my phone regardless of connection with slow loading of gifs and emojis, but usable. Now it's just broken when it comes to uploading images from my phone. It will freeze and eventually load the pic, but then freeze again. I also cannot download images, or get prompts if it did download. The app is extremely buggy still and these updates are just frustrating for what was a pretty good app.",1
com.discord,Hellcat 014,"This app is really good. A great chatting app and a good way to meet new people as well. There are times where certain things will go down, or not work properly, but I've found that it's not the apps problem, it's that my phone doesn't autoinstall updates for some reason. Overall, this app is great and easy to use, really good for connecting with people who share your interests from all over the world.",5
com.discord,Wilson Zuber,"The recent updates have resulted in massive battery drain that wasn't there before, along with a pretty laggy photo sending feature (regardless of wifi network and data). The app is wonderful in respects to being a way to communicate with others, but it just isn't optimized enough yet to be called a ""good"" app in my opinion. As someone who doesn't like it when developers push out updates with bugs in the hopes that the users will locate said bugs for the developers, I am deeply disappointed.",3
com.discord,Lizzie,"discord, how did you manage to get even worse? your past update sucked but was manageable. just when I thought I was getting used to it, you updated again and made it even worse. new bugs: I have to fully close the app if I want it to see that I have new images that I want to send and somehow, the unread message alert pops up every time I get a new message in a channel I'm in and being an active participant of. best of all, sometimes I just get no notifications. update: the update fixed nothing",1
com.discord,Kyrhlaan,"I've used discord since 2015, as it is still better than most other platforms for communication and the like. The most recent update has begun a myriad of destabilization with all the buttons and lack thereof, and not being able to properly respond to people without having almost accidentally calling a while group or accidentally removing them two or three times in a row. I'm going to wait until the next update for any improvements.",2

Videos will automatically pause 2-15 seconds in or just never play at all, no matter how many times you click it, images never load, call quality sucks, c'mon man, why are you being like most companies and going BACKWARDS? We're supposed to be going forwards, making things better, not whatever this is. Update: Can't download photos or videos now, and even if I could, I can't send them.",1
com.discord,Rockstar Fetch,"This app is super buggy. Idk but eveytime when I try to make a bio, it doesn't save and it keeps disappearing, same goes with adding a name too. [EDIT]: Emoticons automatically turn into emojis and there is no way to disable it except on a PC (and why would this even be a feature anyways??)‚Äì there are so many more options on PC than there is on mobile, and on Ipad (tablets, etc.), which makes my Discord experience pretty bad and eh :|",1
com.discord,Mason Hokanson,Fantastic app. Although since an update in August (not sure on that) the app has become very slow and is always struggling to send messages and connect. I would love it and many others would love it if this got fixed. It feels unusable at times. This is just for the android version though.,4
com.discord,StitchTheRavens,"Discord is amazing if you want to talk to others and do smaller roleplays, it's great until you need to upload a larger file or voice call.

It's great unless your intentions are to write full stories or longer conversations.",4
com.discord,Adrian Infante,"Discord itself is amazing. However: This app was fine before, but now it seems that every update fixes one issue and introduces a new one. First, overlay got removed. We got that back but the options were gone from it, then, we got that fixed, but now Bluetooth audio support is broken. Discord clearly is now struggling on how to make an Android app, and it's extremely sad. I use this program to communicate on the daily, and it's so frustrating having to put up with this terrible application.",2
com.discord,C. Q,"I love it to talk to friends here, but the more it tries to LOOK more advanced the more problems it has. I can't even reorder my channels anymore because they bugged the system trying to make it look fancy. In redoing how the layout of the app to look cool, the entire app is laggy and crashes often. How am I supposed to talk to my friends or make servers if, in exchange of looking more cool, the entire app acts up? I'm not the only one who has this issue either, all my friends have issues.",2
com.discord,Melissa Cerna (Mel),"Its really easy to get completely overwhelmed with notifications on this app. If you only want to get notifications from a couple channels on a server, you have to individually mute every other channel manually.

It drives me insane.",2

Also the new font is an eyesore and hurts to look at. I miss the old one, and I also miss how functional Discord used to be.",1
com.discord,WolfieisTrash,"After several updates, the discord app is still awful. When I try to play videos, the video randomly pauses and I can't unpause unless I scroll up or down until it's out of view, and then I have to start over and repeat. Gifs crash the app completely and don't play properly when fullscreened.

This is just lazy.",1
com.discord,Michael Fung,"Update since September 2022 has made the app go from super smooth to constant lag. Maybe it's just optimization issues with older phone models but this is ridiculous. My Samsung 8 phone is so laggy when Discord app is active. Even the digital keyboard becomes impaired, this app is suddenly pulling way too much processing power for really not reason. If I upload any image for sharing, the whole app lags so bad you might as well consider it freezing. Please fix it the app.",1

We can't hear each other, have to leave the call and re-join, you can't hear streams, videos break calls, overlay is broken. Just put it back to how it was",1
com.discord,bean gremlin,Still an awful app. Ever since the massive update over 2 months ago the app has been very broken. While some of the issues have been fixed it seems like everyday I run into a new issue. Automatic compression (THAT YOU CANT TURN OFF!) ruins video audio and sometimes sends images as files even if they're less than 1 mb. Videos often dont play and there are major issues with the connection. Typing is still slow and clunky compared to before the major overhaul. please just revert to the old version,1

Anytime I'm on a call, if the person I'm calling turns on their camera it freezes every few seconds, and the only way to unfreeze it is to minimize the call and maximize it again.

com.discord,Alex A,After the latest updates Discord has become almost unusable on mobile. the UI will slowly distort and become broken over several hours of use and I will often have to force stop the app to fix it. the app will crash randomly and kick me out of calls and the video compression is a terrible feature often multiplying the size of an uploaded video by 4! yes a 500KB video turned into a 2-3 MEGABYTE video while taking forever to compress it! I can deal with the bugs but please remove the compression.,1
com.discord,Kina Dunn,"I've used Discord since 2019, the mobile version used to be worse, but slowly improved over time until it was nearly perfect around June of this year, then an update was released that made doing almost anything a pain in the neck. Videos failing to load, occasional crashes and general bugs were introduced and are still a problem. If I was a conspiracy theorist, I'd say that the person who cleared the update for implementation was a Skype fanatic and couldn't stand seeing Discord take its place.",2
com.discord,cuzhe,"As of the latest update this app has become incredibly unoptimized and broken! Specifically when selecting images and videos to send The app lags hard when browsing media, even moreso then when I try to choose what I want to send. At the same time the camera feature can mess up at times, sending a picture but it only appearing as a file in chat Please fix these issues!!",2
com.discord,Mop Mop,"Mobile notifications have not worked at all for several versions now. I have them enabled in both the OS and app, yet none ever show up on the system notification bar. They do show up in-app if it's currently focused, and in the inbox screen. No other messaging app seems to be having this issue.",3
com.discord,Dane Lovell,"After the last update the Android speech to text will not work. It opens up and then shuts down immediately. And then I will upload a video that is 6-7 MB, it will show that, and then it will tell me that I can't upload anything bigger than 8 MB. Until this is fixed my ratings going to be two stars. UPDATE: after the latest update I am able to upload videos again. The speech to talk is still sketchy but it is better than it was.",4
com.discord,Venemorph hadlock,"I've not been receiving any notifications for the past couple days, server, DM, call, and even @ notifications. I wasn't on do not disturb, all permissions are allowed, uninstalling and logging out didn't help I even checked my other devices. My channels and servers aren't muted and I have no pending updates, I've tried everything and it still isn't functioning",1
com.discord,BirdsRepic,"The app was good before the update. (I'm on android mobile). Now i'm experiencing all sorts of problems such as the keyboard sticking on the screen when trying to exit out of it, which requires me to leave discord entirely. The channels look more compacted which doesn't seem rather appealing. Audio still plays sometimes when watching a video even when it's off screen or in a different channel. Discord freezes a lot of the time. And much more. Please fix these issues. Thank you very much.",3
com.discord,Lark Reid,"Ever since the new update me and other people that I know have completely lost the ability to upload more than one image/video at a time. It freezes on 70-100% when uploading multiple at a time. Now the audio on videos that I upload turn into static. I played the videos on my phone to make sure they weren't corrupted, and they are just fine. Sometimes when I open the app it gets stuck connecting and I have to restart it. Please fix your app asap. It's just not my phone that is effected.",1
com.discord,Oakmeal 52,"Works great when used for text and voice chat. However, the moment any sort of video comes on, everything gets choppy. And whatever you do, don't opt into automatic video compression. I thought it would make it easier to post videos larger than 8mb, but it actually compresses every video regardless of size. While it is almost completely unaffected visually, it replaces any audio the video had with static. The worst part is that there is no way to opt out of it.",2
com.discord,N R,"The update screwed me. I'm on an Android phone. Whenever a gif is sent in DM, whether by myself or another party, the app crashes. The only workaround I have is to go to my gallery and keep trying to send pictures until some (not all) are successfully sent, so the gif will no longer be on-screen. I have already filed a report on this. I hope the issue will be resolved. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. Crossing fingers.",3
com.discord,Westleigh Medlin,"This new update has introduced new features that are pretty strange and a few bugs. For some reason, even though the setting is turned off- gifs sent are automatically compressed an pixelated. Other file types are compressed, too. I wish that wasn't the case. The other problem is that gifs still autoplay even though the setting is turned off, including gifs in the file viewer when uploading files. At this point, I'd rather have the previous version.",2
com.discord,Cory Wilson,"Discord was perfect. The newest update has definitely ruined alot of things for me. First off, when I go to send a video it says it's compressing. After it finally sends, when you play it, the original audio is cut then sounds like TV static. Not only that but the layout for sending a picture or file actually has you browsing through your files instead of just scrolling through like they originally had. Discord please just go back to the old UI. The new update is awful. üòï",1
com.discord,Sustained Depression,"I have been using Discord since 2017, it is one of the greatest apps I have ever used. Such a good app that copy cats began popping up and following what Discord does. Regardless, because of the major UI update, the app has had numerous problems that were never problems from before. For Example, I can't upload multiple images at once but one at a time. It's always small things that builds up to a massive annoyance. I still love the app, and hope all the major bugs are dealt with in the future.",4
com.discord,Tobito,"As of the lasted update, its so damn hard to watch a clip of gameplay on mobile. More towards Android devices, can't say much for apple users. Once I tap on the clip I want to watch, I just sit there and wait for the clip to load, which doesn't come to an end. It just loads there forever. Even if I exit the app, clear it and reopen it, same issue. Please fix this. These problems mainly occur when I try to watch a clip from a rendering bot.",2
com.discord,Diana Dempsey - Gibson,"An extremely useful app. I like the fact that unlike the social apps that you share things with strangers, this allows a much more direct and personal communication. Love the fact we can share one on one, or groups of friends. Sharing photos, videos, information, help organize events, contests, or take polls. We can verbally communicate freely and clearly with friends around the world. My only issue is, Lately, they've added so much junk, its causing games to crash or lag when using this app.",4
com.discord,Becca McClure,"The recent update has completely messed up the app for Android users. I've logged in on android, iOS, and PC, and I only ever have problems with the Android version. The app is constantly crashing. It will freeze on startup. I can't even check any kind of messages or notifications I get throughout the day on my android, because the app will just freeze on the last screen it was open to before crashing, no matter how many times I try to refresh the app. It's extremely frustrating.",3
com.discord,Jason Martin,This app was great. Was. Performance was awesome. Convenience was paramount. The layout was great and aesthetically pleasing. Now they have absolutely ruined it. The layout is hideous. It's all over-animated. Features are clunky or buggy. The layout is big and unpleasant to navigate. How on earth did they mess it up this bad!? It was perfect!,1
com.discord,Rob Stemen,"It's a very well-done and useful app, but has a pretty annoying issues on foldable devices. It has a small screen and a large screen mode, which are both great, but it does not do anything to switch between them. When the device is opened/closed. In order to get the correct view, the app has to be fully killed and restarted. It's fine going from small -> large, but going from large -> small makes the app unusable without a restart.",4
com.discord,Kyle Pearson,"Great UI, but the most recent 2 or 3 updates have the unintended effect of causing the selected channel to scroll all the way up or all the way down when you tap the screen (sometimes). Makes it really hard to watch videos and view images since you have to tap the embed to even view the content properly. I thought this was just a setting but I can't find where to turn it off, so now I'm convinced it's just a bug the devs either haven't seen or don't intend on fixing just yet.",2
com.discord,Jess,"Discord used to be nearly flawless, but the recent updates have caused it to crash. A lot. Every time you click on a message notification, it'll open the app but be in a perpetual ""connecting"" loop, then crash. It'll also randomly stop allowing messages to be sent or claim a message in sent, crash, and when you re-open it's not there. Uninstalling and re-installing doesn't change anything.",2
com.discord,cinna minna,"I used to be super impressed by how the video calls worked way better than other apps on my phone. Now, everything I video call, the other person's video freezes in place on my end and I have to swipe out of full screen and go back in it just to get it to work again. it's become really annoying to say the least, and I have no clue on how to fix it.",2
com.discord,Sneasel,"This version isn't even comparable to the PC version. With the amount of issues, it's near unusable. I've had to reinstall the app multiple times because of various issues that should be easily fixable, including but not limited to: Features not loading (icons, images, voice chat buttons, etc.), incredible lag, and the app repeatedly crashing for no reason. [Edit:] As of now (10/6/22), the app is completely unusable to me because it crashes immediately after I open it, even after reinstalling.",1
com.discord,Oaklen Haney,"Updating: The problem isnt being fixed. So 2 stars were too much, I'm resorting to one star, I'm done with this. The app has issues. It would work better and be more enjoyable if the audio didn't cut out often. I'm having to constantly (literally every 4 seconds, no exaggeration) hang up the call so that it doesn't freeze. I know it's not a wifi internet issue, because nothing has changed from either end in that department. My review can change when the app is fixed.",1
com.discord,Reid Cunningham,"This app used to be perfect, but since August or something, video playback and loading is downright awful. If I want to view a video someone uploaded, it will either freeze and lead to a black screen or not play at all. Very rarely do videos actually play. I also have an issue in which It takes forever for content to send. If I want to send two very small pictures, it just won't send. I have to send them all individually.",2
com.discord,Conner Morgan,"It's a great communicating app that is fast, easy to use, and enjoyable! Definitely a great app for all your communication needs, whether you are a gamer or not! They are always adding new features! To be honest this needs more than five stars. :) (However at the current moment the recent updates to the app have made it kind of broken, especially regarding images and videos, sometimes they appear partly off the screen and and finicky to get them playing, sometimes menus don't display properly.)",3
com.discord,Rob Boss,"This is only for the latest update. I don't know how people thought it was a good idea to ruin the mobile app by modifying it to be similar to the desktop version. My main concerns is how text looks. The spacing is annoying (I've played with the text settings already). When sending photos, it won't show your entire gallery (it loops photos). And more that are mostly personal peeves that cannot be changed in the settings. Good app ofc but I wish I could revert back to earlier update.",2
com.discord,Ciara Helm (LizzardLady),"Some of the previous issues are fixed, but still having trouble. Images don't want to send sometimes, and then when they do, messages from the other person all send at once like the app is trying to play catch-up. Sometimes an image will send twice, but the second one will send later (either minutes later, or like half an hour later). Sometimes my messages take ages to send as well.",1
com.discord,princeofallhallows,"The new update makes me feel like I'm having a stroke. I have discord on multiple clients, and I understand the appeal of trying to make it look and feel more like desktop. However, I have never had a worse experience trying to type, switch channels, or send messages at all. Not to mention that the new text scaling is impossible to get used to and the delay between hitting send and your message going through is nearly a minute on some occasions. My phone has never lagged this much in my life.",5
com.discord,JarOCats,"It works fine for the two servers I've been invited to. Problem is, I see no way to find any other servers; this app lacks the ""explore"" / ""compass"" button I've read so much about. Seems the only solution is to use the Web version, which is way too small on a phone, and out of the question on a laptop (no home intertubes out in the sticks -- only phones). If I'm missing some other method of discovery, I wish someone would let me in on the secret; right now, this app is just taking up space.",3
com.discord,Daisy,"The recent update (and supposed fix for it) has made the app not user friendly. Chats scroll up on their own. Upon opening a chat, even when the app is open and running, there's a prompt that vanishes after a second for me to block or report the person I'm messaging, as if they're sending me a message for the first time. I miss the old way of looking for photos to send in the app. Please put it back to how it was.",1
com.discord,Peepaboo,"Love this app, but the latest update is awful. I appreciate the attempt to make the mobile app more like the PC app, but something needs to be done about this lag. I'll be browsing and suddenly the whole app will freeze. It takes two minutes for it to switch servers sometimes. The emote/gif pop-up lags. The keyboard lags. Sometimes it's so bad that the app will cut me off mid-sentence and only send half of what I typed. Thank goodness I don't use voice chat on mobile, I'm sure it's even worse!",2
com.discord,OJ,"Overall, the setup and design is perfect. There's lots of add-ons that make the experience better, and it's an easy way to connect with any group. Unfortunately Discord on mobile is disappointing compared to PC. It glitches/crashes daily, sometimes freezing while uploading an image (and certain messages, chats, and images will disappear temporarily). Bug fixes are desperately needed since the recent update, but after that, it would be an easy 5 stars.",4
com.discord,Fiorela Zamora,"It use to be good on mobile. Now icons are missing on overlay but the functions are still there. Crashes and kicks me from calls when it never did that before. Overlay is practically useless because it never lights up or even recognizes the other person talking, just me. And then it disappears if you click away. The call box just stays on your screen if you click on another chat or server, and it blocks so much. You can't make it smaller or get rid of it. There is still so much.",1
com.discord,Michael Bartner,"Discord is a great voice and chat platform for communities and friend groups. And the mobile version is pretty solid, with the only exception being that notifications from recived messages on mobile can be very hit or miss. With sometimes it pops up within seconds, while other times it will take anywhere from 10-30 mins to arrive with a chance it won't arrive at all. Now this could vary based on settings on your phone, but from my friends experiences it seems consistent. 4/5 with this problem.",4
com.discord,Darude Sandwich,"please just revert the changes, they were unnecessary and only caused problems. it was fine and a lot of ways better than the iOS version. it was the best version of mobile there was and it became so much worse. it was way less intuitive to use, video chat is now super awkward and inconvenient, and not being able to send compressed photos is a major deal breaker.",1
com.discord,Johnathan Kamuda,"Been using Discord for many, many years. They are always making it better. It's become so much more robust and feature filled since I first started using it. And it's platform to pay for extras is great. You don't NEED to, but it's nice to have that kind of service a available if we wanted some perks. I think some of the options could be laid out better. Personal example - changing individuals volume in a call, not an intuitive option to find at first. Things like that fixed, would be perfect.",5
com.discord,David M,"Amazing app. I use it all the time to game online with friends. You can make your own space (a.k.a. ""server""), invite who you want, and devote it to anything you want. Good for group or one-on-one calling, chat, sharing memes and videos, and streaming your screen for friends to watch. If I could change one thing, it would be to improve the audio quality in calls. Most of the time it is fine, but sometimes people's mics cut out or are distorted. But other than that, amazing app.",5
com.discord,Clyde Cartwright,Update: 2 months later and it's still broken on a flagship device. No fixes at all. To make it better they've released an update that only allows PC users to play games amongst each other leaving mobile in the dark. This update is riddled with bugs. Overlay is completely broken. Won't show who's talking and the controls are just non-existent. The app itself is worse. Press and holds on profiles randomly work once in a blue moon. And you want to change the volume on someone just forget it.,1
com.discord,erik garland,"Discord says it actively rolling out new updates to fix the many problems created by the ""update"" (more of a downgrade), yet none of the problems I or other people have been experiencing have been fixed. For one, discord always resets when I exit the app, even for a split second to go into my files to find a video or photo( another issue), Which creates the issue of only having so many files I can access. I'd ask y'all to fix it, but at this point I don't think you will.",1
com.discord,Sal Watson,"Original: It's obvious that the latest update is just a lazy port of the iOS codebase. Half the time, nothing loads, so I have to exit and restart the app multiple times. When it does work, it's slow and unreliable. If you still have an older version, don't update if you can help it. EDIT: With a previous update, all the icons were invisible, making it impossible to tell which button is which (or if a button was there). It's fixed now, but that bug should never have made it through QA.",1
com.discord,Trinity Comerford,"Good app, although annoying at times. Sometimes I get stuck in certain areas, unable to swipe out of a text channel and having to use the back button on my phone. Also, sometimes I am unable to swipe up or down to get to a certain server. I always just have to close the app all the way and re-open it. I also am having trouble with the image sending. After going offline for a while, I came back and now, even though I'm using my fast home wi-fi, I am unable to send multiple images at a time.",3

I can't send multiple files at once anymore, the font sizes keep changing, making things impossible to read, gifs are completely broken and end up causing severe lag, and I constantly have to go back and refresh channels individually so that they're marked as read. These are just some of the strangest and most annoying bugs I've been experiencing in the last month...",2
com.discord,Ghosty whosty,"I've been using discord since around 2019 and I can say it's changed a lot, both for better and for worse. It may just be my phone but I can't send multiple images at a time and I can only send one and they load very very slowly and again this may just be my phone but sometimes it entirely crashes and I have to fully close out the app and re-open it so it can work smoothly again but it crashes constantly and it's very tiring. Overall, it's a good app just a bit buggy and could use some updates",4
com.discord,Gwendolyn MacTiernan (KittKatt),"Well, here we are months after the latest updates, and this app is so bad I'm considering not using it at all anymore. Bugs, bugs, and more bugs, from visual glitches, to crashes, to odd behavior. And the worst of all, if you want to voice chat, don't even bother. The audio for voice chats and streams is terrible, and best of all, it absolutely tanks the audio quality of literally every other app you use. Seriously, if there is an alternative, use it. This app isn't worth it anymore.",1
com.discord,sweet tarte,"Ever since the updates in September/October, the video calls have frozen and it's progressively gotten worse. When I video call, the person's video will freeze but their audio will be fine. The app is up to date and everything, my wifi is fine. Everything was fine until these updates. The freezing happens every minute or less and it's so frustrating to have to try to fix it only for it to freeze again. Please fix this.",2
com.discord,Adrian G,"Love the app, it's the social media site I use the most often. But I do have a couple critiques because they're pretty important functions. The video chat/phone function is pretty poor quality, when it works at all. It can be really hard to set up a live stream (especially on a mac). And the size limit for pics and videos without nitro is a joke. I can't even send a 10 second compressed video or 3 pics at once. That said, I use it all the time and prefer it to other apps.",4
com.discord,Rain,"The latest update provides the change to changing colors for your profile theme (if you have nitro). When I tried changing the default color to Orange (for the Halloween aspect), it just returned back to its default color (which was white).

com.discord,Ava Jennings (Ava),"it was working just fine until i updated it. (I'm on android mobile) it will NOT. STOP. CRASHING. it's awful, it just freezes every time i open the app and then crashes. i have tried everything. not only that, but it keeps sticking and lagging. and the font sizes are all kinds of screwed up now, and if i try to make it bigger so it looked the way it did before, it's TOO big. it also refuses to send more than one images, it gets stuck at either 2% or 80% and just gives up. Please do something.",1
com.discord,Butterfly Girl,"Not very mobile friendly. Especially, if you play Epic rpg. Being on Discord from mobile is my only option, and I have to constantly clear cache, and force stop the app. The app freezes, lags, and crashes way too much.

com.discord,Candy,"While it was going smooth initially, and I was happy to see the update for the profile colors, everything else needs fixing. I can't upload two pictures at a time. I can't click on a message notification when not using the app, because it takes me to a blank/not loaded screen, and the only way to see it is to close the app and open it again. And now the settings icons aren't showing up on the bottom of the screen? (ie; friends, notifications, etc.) This recent update is so buggy!",2
com.discord,Joel Flintstones,"Recently, I've been having some obnoxious issues. For example, if I try to send a picture or video, it will send, but it won't show up that I sent it on my end until I reboot the app. If I'm in a direct message and switch to a server, sometimes instead of taking me to the channel I was last in on that server, it keeps me in the direct message. Weirdest of all, messages from other people occasionally show as being sent by me, and vice versa. Why are these updates causing more bugs than they fix?",2
com.discord,Nova Bertsch,"So, Discord is an app I've been using for several years for various things. Most prominently roleplay with my close friends. Recently I've been having issues with it on my phone that are disruptive to that. Such as load time issues of channels, avatars, and images. And more recently, my image browser not working. I've found that reinstalling the app usually helps. But I should not have to reinstall it for features that should just work.",3
com.discord,Suzy Yu,"A great way to meet others across the world and keep in touch with them and with family. Not as crazy or overwhelming as FB. It is accessible on your laptop or any mobile devices. Only problem is when using it through any browsers, it won't scroll and give you all the options offered, like the full list of all with the ""@"" or with the ""#"" (not even with ""slash"" commands either.) Yet many perks can only be accessible within browsers and not available in the app itself. Plus, I update always.",3
com.discord,Mewtex,"This app is easily a 5/5, however the recent update that re-worked the UI is not something I like. I know I doubt itll be brought back, but the old UI with the new mix of sounds would have been perfect. This new UI and display is too big and overbearing, and I much preferred the smaller, better UI. It would be great to get it back, as scaling down the text just looks bad in general.",1
com.discord,Jane C,"It's a great app really! But right now, I don't know what happened. I have 5G internet with full bars and it kept saying ""Connecting..."". I was like 20 minutes before calling my friend and it started acting up. Nothing was wrong with my wifi at all, I disconnected my earbuds because my friend said he couldn't hear me and it was sounding weird to him, so the moment I disconnected it, it freezes for a while. Please fix it. Great app overall though!",4
com.discord,Mdbgamer,"The team has messed the app up badly. I used to use Discord all the time, and even at its laggiest, it was never this horrifically bad. I don't mind some of the UI changes so much, but whatever you guys did to the core system, it takes on average 10 to 15 seconds to get any taps, messages, pictures, or even switching channels or servers to even happen from first tap. Doing literally anything on the latest update is painfully slow. Down to two stars only because it's still accessible.",2
com.discord,Troy Andrade,"I use discord on a daily basis and rarely have issues with it, but now recently when I try to send a video, it automatically compresses it before uploading, and when it finishes and sends, it turns to audio to a very loud static so nothing is able to be heard except static. Only one time did it not compress, and the audio came out perfectly fine. I don't know what this is but this is extremely frustrating.",3
com.discord,Khalil Estell,"Absolutely love Discord! My all time favorites communication app. I use it for friends, family, and business and it's served me very well. The mobile client has glitch where it always returns to the last state it was in on, then switched back. It's disorienting but not too bad. The desktop app can't seem to handle spotty internet so it hangs quite often. Otherwise a fantastic app and service baring some things that need to be polished.",5
com.discord,Mr. Doomguy,"I've used alot of apps in my lifetime, and none have made me hate using it from so many bugs, in my life. For example, when I type things in, the keyboard gets stuck in a repeated cycle of actions. All it does is prompt the keyboard to slide up, then the keyboard disappears (rendering the screen useless) because the keyboard just keeps showing up on the screen and then I will cancel out so many times that if you just leave the phone alone the bug is literally running the app. This is ridiculous",1
com.discord,Shawn,"I've been using this app since 2017 and up until recently it's been a near flawless experience. However, recently there was an overhaul ,for lack of better terminology, of the interface and it has almost entirely ruined the app. Constant crashes, input delay, massive lag spikes, you name it, it happens. And as of recently, I cant even send videos as it spends several minutes compressing even the smallest videos just for them to send with corrupted audio so loud it hurts to listen to.",2
com.discord,Deltaroni,"Discord was great before the update, the layout was nice and comfortable and worked pretty well to keep in contact with friends, but now it's nearly impossible to use and feels cramped. It has to reconnect every time I open the app and takes forever to load up new messages. It won't even give me notifications anymore, if I want to see the new messages quickly I have to stay on the app. My friends have been having the same issue too. I'm not sure what exactly you guys did, but you need to fix it.",1
com.discord,Floofy Boi,"I've had all sorts of problems before the update. App hangs and sometimes crashes at startup, the app was slow and clunky, and took so much ram that my UI crashes a lot. After the update however, things have been a lot better. Loading times are much faster, I like the new UI, and things feel way snappier. However I have one issue. I can't watch videos. If I watch from the UI player it crashes instantly and if I watch from the standalone player, it hangs and then crashes. Hope this is fixed.",3
com.discord,Alex Vander Heul,"Just updated and the app won't let me tap on the text box to type, scroll up and down in channels, or open/upload pictures or play videos anymore. The only things I can do is swipe left and right and change channels, but I can't interact within those channels. edit: I swiped right and tap/held another member in the channel to start a PM with them, and after that screen changed to the PM, I got full functionality back. I'm glad I'm not stuck anymore, but still very buggy behavior.",2
com.discord,Anna S,"I really tried but I can't stand this app. While I don't use many of the community features, the ones I do use suffer the same issues as the rest of the app: a poor unintuitive interface and glitchy performance. The voice feature is constantly being updated but as soon as it's working well they change it again. The interface was working fine on my Zfold 3 but suddenly it's cut off on the outer screen so I can't send texts. The fact that they expect folks to pay a subscription is laughable.",2
com.discord,Anthony Mayer,"Not as good as it used to be. Ran into a bunch of issues where messages don't just not send and offer a resend option. They just don't send. At all. Then you have to retype everything. As a student who uses this for group projects, it really makes it easy to drop the ball because messages just don't send. On top of notifications remaining unread, users typing not appearing, default opening to a random channel, and the looking at user profiles straight up having nothing but the name and icon.",1

I have full signal, excellent wifi, and out of nowhere it will cease to load. I keep gettig notifications from the messages I receive but when I open the app, it is forever loading. I don't know what happened, but it's substantially unreliable right now. I have tried to make a support ticket and even that website has trouble loading. So sad.",1
com.discord,Braxton Driver,"Discord is a great app for talking to friends, communication, and more. But recently for mobile users with the latest update, it's become a lot harder to use discord. It's like your using it as if your on a PC or laptop. Moving roles causes me to freeze, moving channels lags it out and images I post are extremely compressed. I feel it should take a step back with one of the older versions of discord, is it possible to use an older version of discord?",3
com.discord,Brody Cheney,"the ugliness of the app is still here and it's still really slow, but there's a new issue: video compression. it compresses the videos and they end up larger than before. it put a 4mb video up to 16mb, making it unusable. it also sometimes messes up the audio, replacing it with static. it's actually like you just want people to stop using the platform.",1
com.discord,Technobl ade,"I've been using this for a couple years, it's been great, I've kept in touch with my friends, met new ones from the variety of servers. It's great for calling, video call, music sharing, nitro is easy to use and simple payment as well as keeping your information safe. But I'm giving it 3 stars because of recent developments. The bot prefixes are harder, more complicated for mobile and PC, it started glitching alot more. Some servers on mobile are messed up, words overgoing each other. Thank you",3
com.discord,error / charlie,"The app has been fine for years. As of late, however, discord has been rolling out so many updates for no reason. The very definition of don't fix what's not broken, they continuously change what the app looks like and how it functions. It used to run incredibly smoothly, yet after updating, it's so slow and has been absolutely killing my battery.",2
com.discord,Daniel Guerrero,"Discord has worked flawlessly for me since the moment I first downloaded it. However, these recent updates have completely ruined my experience for the app. Whenever I try sending videos under 8mb, it ""compresses"" the video and ultimately makes the file bigger which is completely the opposite of what it's meant too do. I send a compressed video that I did myself and the audio for it gets completely replaced by loud static which I don't understand how that even happens. Revert the updates!",1
com.discord,Juregekk ‚Ä¢,"Okay, just unbearable. every update comes with some different bug that totally ruins the experience in the app. in this last update, the videos freeze when they are opened in full screen, there is an annoying delay when I change servers. besides, now it's much more boring and difficult to modify the profile, and sometimes it doesn't even save the changes....",2
com.discord,Jimmy Neutron,"Very solid app and a very good way to communicate with others! I love the fact that you can discover new people by exploring new servers and make your own. The amount of things this app can do is great and I will continue to use it for chatting with my friends. However there's a couple times where the scrolling of text channels and messages gets messed up and hides the bottom parts. Idk if this is like a wifi issue or anything else, but it usually goes away after I close and open the app again.",5
com.discord,Tiffany Tran,"I like the search and pin feature on Discord so I may find messages or images that I want to save. Discord devs are also responsive to reviews than other social media apps. However, the desktop app has more features for easier access, appearance, and efficiency. Makes sense though, since it's mostly for gamers, but it does get annoying when I can't use my second account. I recommend using SuperClone on Discord for it. With the recent update, I can't preview my videos before sending. Meh.",3
com.discord,Brandon Boyd,"Half the channels in my friends server keep disappearing for me, and I can't post in them until sometime else does and I get a notification, and it shows back up. Also, I'll make a post, then make another a while later and it'll run them together like it's the same post, even though a lot of time has elapsed. Most of the .gifs aren't showing up. Clearing cache/data or reinstalling the app fixes it, for like an hour or two... Shouldn't have to do that multiple times a day. This is all new...",2
com.discord,birthday!!!man,"My Issues : 1. The layout change was so unnecessary; everything is harder to find and the organization is off. Texts send slow + no more wide screen, which sucks -- it's really confusing. 2. Everytime I join a voice call in DMs, it always joins me unmuted. Again, unnecessary touch ups. Plus the amount of loud effects that plays when I join / leave a call. I don't need to hear all of that. Even if I turn down the volume, it's still loud. The Android Update is a waste of time. Thanks, Bee.",3
com.discord,David Watt,"It's been good to me for a while, but after the last few updates, it's only been useful for text messaging. Any form of file sharing has been utterly demolished, to the point where just trying to send a friend a 2 or 3 second long video causes it to be compressed to a pixelated, static-noised mess. I know Discord wants everyone to spend money on their stupid subscriptions, but that's no reason to make non-paid users suffer.",2
com.discord,Matthew Dingman,"I have used discord for a couple years now, and It was great. The latest updates, however... They ruined the UI, moved a whole bunch of buttons, and made the app way more resource demanding, to the point where my phone barely runs it, and it frequently crashes. It even got to the point where my device resarted ITSELF. Please add some sort of option for us with low-end devices.",2
com.discord,Donald Lugo,"This is a must for any gamer! Just to chat, play and talk or maybe just show of your games. You can also tip each other if your stuck. The only thing I'm gonna say is that some times it glitches and voice won't go through. You must exit server and re-enter. It does not happen to every body, so is perhaps lag sensitive? It happens a lot more on phone network than wifi, but I do have a friend with slow net constantly needing reconnect. On pc I never have this issue, is only on the app.",4
com.discord,Jesvin Jose,"The latest update is not gois. The app is slow and it's buggy, when I swipe right to go change the channel, my profile info comes up. The UI change is fine but the channel button size feels small. I do quite like the new UI for the picture selection though. Its more neat and tidy. I also like the addition of some more settings. I prefer the old way the status changing thing looks but the new one is fine.",3
com.discord,Chatmendy,"Everything works most the time. However, the last few updates have made everything.work less on mobile. Whether it's the overlay being completely useless now only showing when you speak along with the drop down options not appearing . In a server with a lot of channels there's a glitch that makes all the channels at the bottom inaccessible needing you to close and reopen the app to get them back. Finally, with the last few UI changes in a VC they made it more inconvenient to adjust ppls volume.",3
com.discord,HarDe One,"CURRENTLY BROKEN ON GALAXY S10e! Discord has functioned fine for years, this is the first issue I've ever had. Just updated the app, and now it crashes while trying to connect to the server. This is clearly an issue with the app itself, if it was having an actual issue with connect8ng to the server, the channel list would be blank and it'd say it cannot connect. The crash means it's something to do with the app itself.",3
com.discord,Gacha stuff123,"Bunch of new updates to ""fix"" what was already perfect. Trying to move to the same sort of system as the pc application is smart, but it's causing so many problems with this app that it's almost unbearable. I click on a notification to access a message, half of my favorite emojis are gone. I try to find a server, it's disappeared. I have to continually close and reopen the app for it to work. Discord was better before, let's go back to that",3
com.discord,Caden Bentley,"Edit: Don't do the update, y'all. I very reluctantly downloaded the update to see if it would fix anything and it actually made things worse. It now lags whenever I type anything too fast, even slower trying to go to new messages, anytime I click back to the app it displays the beginning conversation the channel/DM, was already having trouble with the app refusing to allow me to use voice to text but it absolutely will not work. I'm so extremely disappointed in how this is being handled.",1
com.discord,B. S,"I've used Discord for years and never really had a problem with it, but the last few updates have made it run worse. I updated to the latest version, but keep getting messages that it's still connecting. I also sometimes don't see the most recent messages in servers and have to keep exiting out & reopening the app. It's gotten to a point where I'm writing a review, which I never do.",3
com.discord,Cali Nuff-Said,"The new update with notification sounds not being able to turn off, is quite annoying to the fact that I don't really want to use the app a while lot. It's been fine for the most part since I have used it since it was only browser based. But these recent updates have annoyed to the point that I got to say something. I only ask for the option to turn off notication sounds.",4
com.discord,SBF,"Alright so there's definitely a bunch of things off with the app ever since it started receiving these periodic updates. Discord now has a tendency to crash whenever I click on any chat notifications, images have to be sent one at a time from a device (that might just be me), and though the call overlay buttons work, it's incredibly laggy and doesn't show who else is in a call by lighting up when they speak. This might be an intentional design choice, but it does make things a bit inconvenient.",1
com.discord,John,"I've never really had issues with the app before, but it's been almost unusable with this week's update. Everytime I click a notification the app hangs and only has a 50/50 chance of actually bringing me to the message I clicked the notification for. Very slow and unreliable right now. Hope you guys are able to revert the changes and bring it back to how it was before.",3
com.discord,N A,ever sense the recent updates the app has been horrid. It doesn't show all of my images and instead shows the same ones over and over again. Not only that but to even send images I have to send one at a time. I can view all of my images by going to my files but if I select them it kicks me off the app. on top of that I can't join a server anyways unless it's a direct link sent to me. if I try to join another way it kicks me off.,1
com.discord,Quite Bluish,"I used to have no complaints about this app, and would use it as much as the PC app. However as of recent updates, the app has become incredibly buggy and frustratingly difficult to use. In fact there's SO many bugs I've experienced with the recent update that I literally cannot fit them into this review. This is frustrating. I loved this app and it was fine the way it was. Now it's broken and annoying. Most of the times I have to reset Discord entirely to fix anything. Just use the PC app.",1
com.discord,Carter,"It was solid until the latest update. Now posting pictures or videos are iffy, gifs and videos show up black or muted, and trying to react to images requires you to press the top rather than the general message box. (Edit: Now it is even worse. Videos and photos take longer to post, and for videos you run the risk of when they are uploaded the sound is loud static instead. What is going on???)",1
com.discord,Gianna G,"I love discord. It's become my main source of communication over the years however I dislike making calls on my phone with it. For a few years now if my phone's screen turns off then it also cuts me off from the call. I can hear my friends but they can't hear me. So I have to keep my display on if I do have to make long calls. It didn't use to be like this, sad :c Also again using discord on my phone, if I'm away from the app itself for more than a few minutes then it cuts my voice off as well.",3
com.discord,Pringle 1,"Used to be an amazing app. However ever since the august update it's been horrible. I can't even type without clicking on it multiple times for my keyboard to appear. Audio calls have major issues. I can't leave the app without it disconnecting me from the call, and calls make it harder to type. I can't even upload files hardly anymore. I think this is just an Android thing though? Other people have been having the exact same issues. It's not my phone or wifi I made sure of that. Fix this asap.",1
com.discord,MEMESCOEP,"I love discord, but recently there have been a few problems. Most issues are solved by restarting the app, but ever since the discord nitro basic update, I can't upload videos without them being extremely loud, to the point where it's just static. The videos play just fine, but the audio is completely messed up. I hope this will be fixed soon.",3
com.discord,Rin Kazuki,"Since the August update, I have experienced freezes after only typing in servers I frequently visit. It's also unresponsive prior to. I have wait a literal minute before I can even forcibly close the app. I don't know the reason for these changes, but from I've read on other reviews, the Discord team is alienating a LOT of people. It may have something to do with the Xbox update, but I can't be too sure.",1
com.discord,Kiko,"There are so many problems with the new update. There's always this weird gap in between the first message and second one; If it only takes up one line, it leaves this gap of space. I've found another problem, which is that every video I post ends up having this ear busting static, despite it not sounding like that when I saved the file or when I watch it through my gallery.",2
com.discord,Rorschach The Vigilante,"After the latest couple updates, the app has become a major pain to use. My biggest pet peeve is that if you start playing a video before making it full screen, it freezes and will not play until you exit the app and restart. Videos will randomly corrupt upon downloading, with no relation to the file format. It worked just fine a couple months ago and now it's just completely broken. For the love of God, fix this.",2
com.discord,Jonathan Sancha,"Video player barely works. Sometimes shrinks to 2/3 of the screen. The player also sometimes glitches out, making it impossible to scroll or skip to certain parts. Gallery view is busted in the sense that if you try saving and scrolling, you'll end up with multiple copies of the first image in the chain of posts. I'm also not a fan of having to leave gallery view to see other image chains.",1
com.discord,Arietta Miller,"The new updates are downright awful. The previous format was better, less confusing, and less laggy. The only reason it's getting 2 stars is because it was better than this. With the new mobile updates, you also cannot see many of your gallery images. You CAN'T send multiple files either. It's stuck forever sending. And don't even try and get help from the help email on the playstore. It's unsupported.",1
com.discord,Reza CatThing,"Ever since they dropped independent development for the android version of the app, it's been functioning horribly. Went from workable, to an absolute nightmare. How is it that you've gotten so lazy that you refuse to make sure the app actually functions properly for people? Uploading multiple images just no longer works on android, everything loads slowly, or not at all, no matter the connection. It's an absolute joke. Edit: whatever connection I use does not change this at all. I have tried.",1
com.discord,DVC Minis,"I've been paying for Nitro for the past 5 months I believe but I'm not sure it's been that worth it. I started paying for it so that I could send videos more than 8mb but the 100mb upgrade isnt that much better. It makes it hard to even send a 1 minute clip without having to cut a ton of it just to send it which is very limiting. I wish they would allow you more upload space, st least 200mb. I use this app all the time to keep in touch long distance so the 4,000 characters is a great bump up.",3
com.discord,Dae Wolfward,"I use it all the time. There are always some issues with it, like cutting out audio and random disconnects, but I prefer using discord over anything else. Honestly, the biggest thing I wish I could do was put a custom tone for my texts, but neither my phone nor discord will allow that. The ability to stream is great, the threads and new forum features are helpful, and the ability to organize channels however you need is amazing. Setting role permissions per channel is kind of annoying though.",4
com.discord,Brian Dieball,"It's a great app for keeping in touch with friends and others with similar interests. The only real complaints I have is the occasional, lack of any notifications despite having several messages waiting for me and when it doesn't tell me someone is trying to start a voice/video call. Otherwise it's a good app overall that I get daily use out of.",4
com.discord,Atlas,"Discord mobile app used to work just fine, I'll even add perfect. When the new updates came about, it completely ruined my experience with the mobile app because videos do not load, and can not send multiple images like it used to. Discord, I know you mean well, so please fix these issues. (Yes, I'm using the latest version).",1
com.discord,DJ 101,"Really good set up and customization of servers to help organize talk channels. Audio calls also work as attended with a good amount of ping. But, a con would be most of the time the frame rate gets low or the video or streaming in general gets choppy easily. It's hard to keep up with what a person is trying to show when it lags most of the time. Along with bugs with the noise suppression and microphone turning off and on. But, overall, it's a good app to use to chat with friends.",4
com.discord,Birb Vibes,"I literally hate the new update, everything looks weird, and the messages pop up suddenly instead of sliding into view, emoji toggle is gone, search bar looks different, the gallery for sending images looks different, I hate all of it. Not to mention it comes with more bugs. Originally I'd downloaded an older version to avoid this but now that doesn't work and I'm about to have a breakdown over this update. I despise this and hope it gets changed back to the way it looked before.",2
com.discord,Saelath,"Great app. I use it mostly for gaming. Slower than most when transferring files or loading messages. Notifications are wonky - I don't always get them. Definitely room for improvement but the voice call and watch stream features, I rarely have an issue with. Also, it took me a while to learn how to navigate.",4
com.discord,ReclaimedDoor,"It's very good! I can post memes, chat during a game, and also use bots in servers! Edit: 3 years later, it kinda started to dig its own hole with the UI update. It brought a lot of bugs that weren't there before, and as of this writing, uploading files is bugged to where it thinks any file exceeds the file limit, even if it doesn't, essentially not allowing any files to be uploaded. Hope this bug is fixed soon, I still enjoy this app but its starting to show some neglect and troubles.",2
com.discord,cheetahquick9,"I absolutely love discord, but oh my word this new update was simply a downgrade. They UI is massive and cumbersome now, the text while typing is larger so even writing short messages fills up the screen and makes you have to scroll through your message, and it just looks so much worse than it was before updating. Honestly just go back to the old UI and all these problems would be solved. I never had a single issue with the old UI, so this was truly a step backwards.",1
com.discord,Makenzi Glass (Knight Of Void),"The latest update has caused some critical issues with this app. Messages containing more than one image refuse to send, and I have been consistently relocated to a random spot in one singular servers channels every time I relaunch the app. Also, this isn't recent, but the way the application handles in call audio causes major distortion no matter what you attempt to do, and this used to be something you could fix until an update a few years back. Desktop seems unaffected in comparison.",3
com.discord,Storm Hawke,"I love this app but the recent update is terrible. When I tap a notification, it goes to the last channel seen instead and only sometimes switches to the one with the notification after a significant lag. Messages don't automatically load consistently. I cannot hide my keyboard now, so it limits visible messages. Also new notification flyouts cover the menu and you can't do anything till they go away. Two months later, there's no improvement and now it keeps crashing and behaving erratically.",2
com.discord,Ashley Z,"Love Discord! Originally migrated over from Skype and have not regretted the decision once. Outages are short-lived and glitches are usually addressed promptly. I find the user interface to be clean and easy to navigate, and the ability to switch over to dark mode is always a plus. There are no ads plastered everywhere, and the Nitro subscription is optional (but very worth looking into!). If you're not sold on Discord, definitely give it a try and see how you feel. Wumpus needs more friends!",5
com.discord,David P,"It works for basic chatting, but recent updates have consistently broken everything media-related. Photos mostly work, but are sometimes bizarrely cropped. Any kind of animated media barely works at all, they mostly either blank out, refuse to play, or play stretched to a weird aspect ratio. Same for social media embeds. It's just been a mess for a while now.",2
com.discord,Canopus Wolph,"Update: New version now has the app hang when trying to send multiple photos or videos, then fail to send, entirely. Checking the reviews, it seems I'm not the only one with the problem. Being in IT myself, I've more than confirmed the issue isn't on my end. Video streams now stutter & look pixelated regardless of connection speeds between two users. Pre update they were crystal clear. Many, and more bugs that need squashing. Newest build ver. (148.14),: issues still persist.",1
com.discord,Tord ‚ÄúRed Leader‚Äù Larsson,"This is a great app for talking to my friends however, there are lots of bugs I cannot fix. 1st one is the time on mobile, it is ALWAYS 2 hours ahead of what I have set on my phone. I have tried changing my phone's settings to fix it, trying to hard reset discord, reinstalling discord. Things like that, and nothing seems to fix it. 2nd every time I send a message and then another one it adds a large gap and I have to scroll up and down to fix it. These are minor issues but just annoy me a lot.",3
com.discord,MonoRayJak,"Discord is a handy app on computers, but the mobile version is flooded with issues. Every update seems to break something new, and each thing broken seems to be different each time. The most recent update as of writing this review has destroyed any ability for me to send images on Android. I have tried on my home wifi, my school wifi, sending a large group of pictures, sending one picture, sending a picture from another location, sending the image from within the app. None of it works.",3
com.discord,Taylor Smith,"Mostly a desktop user, but pleased that the mobile app has generally had 95% of the same functionality. A few things are overly complex for the UI but that's a hard problem since they don't give you a ""neutered"" discord experience on mobile. Considered downgrading because my partner has consistent issues with losing audio in calls when the app isn't in the foreground, but it still seems like it might be some Samsung interference into audio access or battery saving features. Not sure.",5
com.discord,Alimorel Manx,Newest update makes me nauseous. The font sizing and shapes are different from section to section. The text box makes the font humongous then shrinks it down when you hit send. I feel like I'm going to be sick ü§¢. The new msgs on the top is way too big and gets in the way. Multiple times I've gotten dragged to some random other thing. Some of these changes should be rolled back or made optional settings at the very least. & it broke sending gifs. It hasn't been fixed in any updates. Yucky to use,1
com.discord,Anson Fear,"The app is great and the service discord provides is absolutely, well, vital to my lifestyle. It's much more efficient to communicate with friends and groups than any social media platform I've used, and the call quality is absolute great, even better than systems used for zoom and an upgrade from platforms like Skype. It's not perfect, there are technical bugs here and there that usually aren't a big distraction. I have not used the nitro subscription.",4
com.discord,adnaprellik,"This used to be a 4 star app. After recent updates, discord is pretty glitchy on mobile. For example, channels within servers randomly (and frequently) disappear. This is not an, ""Oops, I accidentally collapsed this channel category!"" issue. All or just some channels will completely disappear. Sometimes they will re-populate when I swipe around or exit and re-enter a server; however, I typically have to close the app and restart it.",3
com.discord,Andy Shoemaker,"This is a great app for texting and this is the only way me and my girlfriend can actively communicate. The thing is, the video chats keep lagging and freezing no matter the wifi or network connection we use. Sometimes under great network connection, it will say I have no service while all my other apps work. It keeps crashing any time I go to see a chat while in a call. I have done everything since the latest updates to fix it. Nothing has changed.",2
com.discord,Connor Hilpert,"I use it all the time and it works but my biggest complaint is that every update seems to fix one issue and create another. For instance right now the problem is that when I full screen a video call, every 20 seconds the video stops and is stuck on a frame but I can still hear the person I'm calling with. The only fix I've found is closing out of full screen and reopening but it just freezes again after 20 seconds.",4
com.discord,Dale Johnson,"Voice quality and the like are average, limits on file size for images are too low, and it only has basic voice options and controls compared to TeamSpeak, but cramming all of it into a single app that can also be used to socialize, and now with an easy way to add forums to your server (kinda, plus I haven't used it yet) is a great combo to have. You can pay to get around some of my complaints, but only on a per user basis. It'd be better if it was included for everyone on boosted servers",4
com.discord,Artist Oblivion,"Ever since the most recent mobile layout update, things have become almost unmanageable. If this app wasn't my only source of communication for many of my friends, I would uninstall it. The new UI is ugly, I cannot send more than one attachment at a time without the message being stuck at 0% processing, and the entire experience has become so much clunkier.",1
com.discord,Mary Early,"EDIT 9/13/22: Like many others have stated, this app has gone completely downhill after the latest update. Never in the past 5 years of using this app have I found myself having so many issues. From needing to restart the app once every 10 minutes because images will not load to the app getting stuck on the ""connecting"" loading message, this most recent update is a disaster. And that's just 2 of many issues. || 6/4/20: Best messaging app out there! I use it every day!",2
com.discord,Adam Suddon,Really great overall. A core reason why my friend group was able to stay tight over the last few years. Recent updates made things more difficult and there were a few weird bugs that have been getting ironed out. I would like more formatting options when using android's share function from another app to a discord post. That's something that's been reduced to a small single lined text box during a recent update.,4
com.discord,Jacque Champagne,"The last update simply broke the app for chromebook users. Since I was unable to watch videos, I though maybe updating it would help with the issue, well as it turns out, you not only didn't fix this but you also created more problems. So now, I can't watch videos, the formatting is uncomfortable, sending files (videos and pictures) has never been both so broken and so over complicated. The images get cut off and I get a lag spike whenever there is a gif or picture on the screen.",1
com.discord,kitty dragon52,"(I have an android) before this recent update I was happy with how my discord worked but one day I opened the app and suddenly it was unusable, forcing me to update to the newest version. Now when I open the app it takes forever to load, freezes constantly, my keyboard gets stuck on the screen, and being in a call is unbearable. I've been trying to turn off the push sounds but it seems like you cant. I'm very sound sensitive and liked how silent the app was before.",3
com.discord,ZackAttack_5,Good app. Does what it's supposed to do and is easy enough to use. Bugs are pretty rare but they're usually pretty entertaining when they do show up. Most videos I send from my phone have the audio wrecked and all you hear is incredibly loud white noise. I should also point out this is my only issue of this sort in the 5 years I've used discord.,5
com.discord,Alissa Hall,"Editing my review from 2 to 4 stars because I was able to solve the problem I had. Discord is a pretty good app. I can't say that it was as great as it used to be, since after the August update it's noticably slower in proformance, but it does its job. I don't really like where the call buttons are in DMs. I feel like at any moment I could accidentally call someone. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.",4
com.discord,Benjamin Greenwood,"A great place to get together with friends to hang out in video/voice calls, play games and stream movies/TV shows. I've made so many friends on this app and it's been an invaluable means of keeping in touch with people over long distances, especially during lockdown. But, it can be a bit confusing or overwhelming for people unversed in platforms like these. It isn't exactly a social media app like Instagram or Telegram even if it is certainly used like one.",5
com.discord,Laina Pup,"The app was great until the new update for Android. I hate it. It ruined the way fonts look for me, gave the entire app an unneeded jolt, and long or generally small images are practically unviewable now. My screenshots are all messed up, and you can't zoom in easily like you used to. It'd be great if we had an update where we could choose which version of the app layout we'd rather be on, because I'm currently having unneeded sensory panic. If you haven't updated, DON'T. It's for the better.",2
com.discord,mikaylarae locus,"I've been using this app for years now with almost no problems but only recently decided to download the mobile version. I literally CAN'T USE IT.

I LITERALLY CANNOT PRESS IT.",2
com.discord,Wyyverns,"I love what discord offers as a platform, but their mobile app keeps getting more annoying to use with every update. They've changed the feel of the app three times in what feels like less than a year, each time making it worse and harder to navigate. I will keep using it and wishing for it to get better because I have no other choice, but it sucks to suffer from unnecessary change.",2
com.discord,Teddy E.,"I usually love using discord to communicate with friends and family, but some of the most recent update changes have messed things up. The spacing between shared links and typed text is terrible, I can't easily link in chats via other apps, and for some reason when I get to the most recent chat post it doesn't update to get rid of the notification. I also can't turn off the link scan, which is highly inconvenient.",1
com.discord,J. White,"My friends and I use this app literally every day! I use it for D&D, video game comms, collaborative projects, and meeting new people! One of the only features I wish for is a noise-canceling slider; while trying to make sound effects my voice is often lost, perceived as background noise on the app lol But if you're looking for a great cross-compatible communication app, then oh yeah, you've found it.",5
com.discord,Aurora Ortega,"Before the recent updates, discord mobile was doing great. Messages would send, images would load AND compressed images would actually send unlike now. Even voice calls are annoying, video chat as well! There's too many new buttons and things added that its difficult to find what you're looking for. It's a bit disorganized for me, it looks like you guys crammed so much together. Discord also occasionally crashes randomly and it's frustrating.",1
com.discord,L.M. Allen,"The premium option for this app is affordable and worth it, and the free option is just as useful within its limitations. In the years since I downloaded Discord, I've found streamlined communications with friends over multiple servers, in multiple chats, and in voice and video chat. I haven‚Äôt had a single problem caused by a glitch. Everything is easy to navigate. It's all housed within a few pages, no features are truly hidden. And it all comes with a healthy layer of anonymity.",5
com.discord,Gakupo's Peacock (Mimi),"Before the big update, i do not like how the state app is currently is. It used to be smooth and connections were smooth but now i have issues reconnecting into the app, never had that problem before the big update. The format of text is smaller and the photo selection is more limited than before. When rereading old messages it doesn't stay in place, if there was an option to go back before the update or make huge improvements to make discord how it was before, I'll be greatful.",2
com.discord,BioResidentSKG,"Keeps crashing, can't even type before someone makes a comment or a notification pops up that instantly stops the entire app and having you to go back and retype everything. And for some reason when I open the app back up, text that I already sent magically re appear in the text box. This was fixed before but came back, and it's annoying. The app was perfectly fine before this and was a great app to chat with, still is. But these returning problems are ruining my experience.",1
com.discord,Alex Smith,"I finally discovered that the new discord update works with my phone, and as such I updated. So far it has been an ok experience. Still getting used to the UI differences, but there are also plenty of glitches still. Overall this is hopefully a better move to ensure no split attention between discord builds, and thus eliminate bugs. But until then I suppose I am stuck having to scroll down over and over as it resets my scroll progress.",3
com.discord,Novangst Media,"I love discord, but as soon as the latest update came out, I've only had problems. Rhe app, stored on my SD card (which has never been a problem), duplicated. One app didn't work, the other didn't stay opened. I closed the apps and uninstalled, but the icons stayed. No other app had this issue. Even then, the lag is ridiculous. Its impossible for me to type and hit send as it lags and takes extra time. Photos on bots delete, and take ages to re-add, only to delete again. So many othe issues too.",2
com.discord,Leonard Pryde,"Literally can't do anything when in call with someone. If you're in a call, it lags and freezes. If you're in a public vc, same issue. If you're doing literally anything on this new version that literally no one asked for, it freezes. Further issues include tapping messages leads to a jump in scrolling, video channels lagging more than before, events not showing, notifications and calls not going through in dms, and overall stuttering or slow response times which can be frustrating when frequent",1
com.discord,Sohom Das,"the new UI update is buggy and annoying. when you long press on a message, sometimes the popup pops up with a vibration, sometimes it doesn't vibrate but it still pops up, and sometimes it doesn't pop up at all. I like that discord's trying to make their UI more fun to use with animations and other things that the previous update didn't have, but it isn't perfect",3
com.discord,Kari Li,"I managed to get the email changed after some hassle. This isn't a bad app overall, but I feel like some ""ease of use"" concepts get overlooked? I suppose if you do run into problems contact support. It's at least pretty quick from my experience. Hoping they add a feature to opt to send verifications to email OR phone number in the future, just because my email gets real finicky.",3
com.discord,Cameron [„Ç≠„É£„É°„É≠„É≥],"The app was great for a long time. The first update of the new UI was more or less fine for me, despite it being kinda buggy. This latest update has had several bigger bugs that come up. Image thumbnails missing horizontal limits and run off the screen. A black section covering the bottom of the list of channels in my servers making many of them unaccessible. Discord really needs to get this new UI working as well as the old one before releasing it to us in this Alpha state.",1
com.discord,DJ Stomp (Salvo),"In the past month or so, the performance has worsened so severely that Discord has gone from being my favorite app, to the most frustrating app on my phone. It crashes every 30-60 seconds, and every time I update it just gets worse and worse. Devs, whatever you're doing lately, it's not working. Please stop breaking discord, if you really want to change it that much, make a new, seperate version so the rest of us who liked it just the way it was can still use it. Please?",2
com.discord,Vincent T,"Updated to the latest version and it's been an annoying app to use for the last month or so. Media including videos, images, gifs all act glitchy when using the app, Discord always has trouble connecting and loading chats as well. UI could've stayed the same if it meant the app functioned as it did just a few months ago. They've released several updates since then however none of them are solving the issues. Y'all might as well roll back. Not cool Discord. I pay for this app too.",2
com.discord,Scuderia Doggo,"The app back then before the updates were excellent and was done fine. I can upload videos n pictures with ease without it sending me to another tab. Lastly, the format was fine and well done. The new update however is broken. It takes so long to upload the pictures and such. Clicking on pictures is a pain because it sends me to another screen instead of showing me in the discord app. It always lagged so badly to the point it becomes unusable at times. Discord, please fix this.",2
com.discord,Andrew Savage,"Ever since the update the app barely works. Slows when typing, can't upload more than 1 file at a time, no matter how small, and even then it can take a full 60 seconds. Not the wifi. Every other app works perfectly, wifi is fantastic, and it's uploading to server no problem, but then it just says processing for a minute or forever and just vanishes without sending. Just use the desktop version. App is trash now. Also the Bluetooth recognition is God awful now for voice chat, don't know why",1
com.discord,Harris,"Discovered the issue with changing profile pictures. Pixel phones seem to like to save images as .webp files but displays them in the gallery as image files. Another issue I've encountered on my Pixel phone is that if I try to send a collection of images, usually between 6 and 10, it will tell me that the attachment data couldn't be found, even though it's under the 8MB file limit, so I'll have to go back and send each one individually.",4
com.discord,Ray,"Before the most recent updates (I think the last 2) this was a great app. Now it's genuinely, barely usable. It's laggy, crashes often, there are so many little bugs that end up making the experience of using this app, miserable. It was great before. I don't understand why you needed to change something what was fine and fixing the bugs that it had, instead of completely breaking it.",1
com.discord,ChibiLuka ChibiDuo,"I was enjoying the new update, the app was running smoothly. Then I was in a call one day and suddenly it dropped. I thought it was my net so I closed the app, but ever since it loops on load. I cleared the cache and data and still no luck, it loads on loop at the log in. The only way to fix this is to completely uninstall and reinstall. I've had to do this every time it ends up in a loading loop and restarting my phone does not fix the issue.",2
com.discord,Liam Waddleton,"Amazing app with everything I could want in it. Great way for me to communicate with friends. User interface is well designed, and the app has never crashed on me. Update notes are not only easy to read, but fun to read in many cases. I especially like how, in recent years, the PC version of the app will let you directly invite people through discord to join a game, like Halo Infinite or Borderlands 3. The app barely uses any of my phone's battery, and I've never seen it glitch out.",5
com.discord,Terabyte,"The app has been making a ton of changes lately to it's UI and it's not really for the best. Being no longer able to zoom in, photos and gifs take longer to load. In some servers like art galleries, gif finders and even just normal servers the app will crash without fail if don't turn off animations. Please revert some of these if possible and do better. I know you can.",2
com.discord,Random Wolf,"Communications app to connect with friends, family, creators and more. Discord had recently fixed the echo within calls but now when ever you use it on the phone. The call will not receive your voice at all so you must keep the screen active at all times. It was a struggle especially when gaming. Tapping the screen everytime it is about to fade into black.",4
com.discord,Addy,"The new layout and text is hideous. Also, I hate that you can't see exact timestamps on older messages anymore. What if I want to know the hour something was sent? Stupid. Updating with more issues as I've been unfortunately cursed to use the new version: - Whenever I open the app, it loads in light mode sometimes even though I have dark mode turned on. - Whenever I try uploading a new profile picture, some images give me an error and refuse to go through. ""No image data,"" or w/e.",1
com.discord,OreoEatingHusky,"Discord itself is a great thing. The mobile app, at least on android, is NOT. I have had increasing issues in the past two months of messages not sending, channels not opening and general connection to the app. This happens on both my data and my wifi. It is extremely frustrating to me. I still recommend the app but as of this review the app is trash.",1
com.discord,Bea Butter,"Discord was great before this update. Ran like a dream, usable UI, never any complaints. High quality chat app. Now, the app crashes (literally never before), the UI changes I might otherwise be able to get over- cramped channel view, keyboard not showing up for emoji or gif search, pulse feedback when I open or close a server folder, mismatched font sizes- are maddening, on top of myriad loading issues mean I just wish I could revert. I would do an awful lot for an option to do so.",2
com.discord,Seth L.,"The app has definitely gotten better and a lot less glitchy since my review of it in September. However now pretty much nothing related to media (emojis, profile pictures, images/videos sent to chat) will load. I have bad internet and I expect it to sometimes be slow but this is just ridiculous. I've never had it be anywhere near this bad prior to the UI update. App isn't completely broken anymore so it gets two stars instead of one but this issue still makes the app unusable. Please fix.",2
com.discord,sarcastic McSpastic,"This was probably one of the most stable, reliable, and transformative apps on the market for Android as a platform. I've made friends on it, I hoast events over it, and it's slowly made it's way into being an essential part of any modderaltey tech-savvy persons software toolkit That being said, recent updates have made this app one of the most unstable applications on the android market, featuring frequent crashes when trying to play or open video files now, and constant random bugs and hiccups",2

Several updates later and the issues are still there, still can't see when others are talking, the overlay is still bugged out. Please fix this. (Updated)",1
com.discord,Evaline Rose (Twilight's Melody),So the new update has made Discord on my phone practically unusable. When I click on something it takes longer to load or switch servers. If I'm on a channel when it gets a new message I have to mark as read or change channels and change back. Can't download images from it even after giving it all permissions in settings. And the channels and font size are way too compact it makes reading hard and trying to turn it up makes it too large.,1
com.discord,Leo Davis,"A few issues have been fixed such as the text zoom from what I have seen before the update but I still have express dissatisfaction. I would rate this 5 stars if it wasn't for the new Android update. It reset all my settings, the channels are way too close, and it is even more obvious who I have blocked has texted. Other than that, pretty cool. (Edit: I change this from 5 to 4 stars because of the new image UI. (Edit 2. Manually jump to messages. 3/5",3
com.discord,Dustin Alday,The new update has caused so many issues for me. The UI is terrible and looks bad. Gif don't show up nor do some pictures it's just black even if you tap on it just pulls up a black screen. The text is so small and adjusting it makes everything off. You can't even mark all as read without going through menues now. Plus everything is now lagging for no reason. This is just terrible and bad. Update: These issues are still here. And after last night's update it's constantly crashing.,1
com.discord,Tnomic Vierling,"Recent update seems to have disabled older builds, forcing use of a clunky, poor performance, inferior UI version. The older version was fine as it was. It worked as it should unlike now. Something as simple as swiping to the right bring up the server bar and left to close it no longer exists in this version. How can this be so lacking? bringing up server options shows a small portrait sized window which looks like a misuse of space. Surprise, the image sharing UI is broken in landscape.",1
com.discord,Carter ‚ÄúMuhammad Razavi‚Äù Nance,"This new update is absolutely horrid. Y'all really sat down and said ""Yo, how can we just ruin our app and make it a chore to use."" It was perfectly good before, you just changed it for the sake of change, and you made the app terrible. It's clunky, my vc audio cuts out, freezes constantly, my keyboard slows when typing, the entire voice and video chat system breaks as soon as you leave the app, other people's cameras glitch off screen constantly, it's slow, and doesn't feel fluid anymore.",1
com.discord,Leana Yomeiri,"The update has ruined functionality. I can't send multiple photos or take a photo in app. It reloads the entire app any time I switch between apps.

The mobile app seems to actually be slightly more stable than the desktop app, I enjoy all the features and ease of use.

com.discord,Booshie,"I will never understand why you have to pay to send higher quality images or videos, let alone stream in a higher quality. Many other apps have those features for free and frankly are easier to use with the new update they gave it. Being an artist is beyond hard when sending clients low resolution images or videos. It's quite sad, really. Please remove the lock on sending higher quality images and I might change my rating.",2
com.discord,xPjot,"Horrible new update. It is incredibly slower than before and takes so much longer to just simply load a channel. I can't click on any videos from my friends (especially Twitter links) because it'll either just be a black screen, load really slow, or just crash my app. Videos are also much easier to accidentally click which makes it even more likely to crash and lag trying to navigate through channels and servers. Fix please",2
com.discord,Chris Thomas,"The user interface was not obvious to navigate at first, however using the app for 30 min is enough get the gist of it. Additionally, closing the app does not ""hang up"" from a voice chat, which required a minor adjustment. After those lessons are learned, the value of the app is extraordinary.",5
com.discord,Spencer Black,"Listen. Actually do something right for a change. Every update you've rolled out has made this app worse and worse. I'm not done, keep reading. The app is slow, half the time it won't let me type, messages sometime fail to appear for minutes on end, it crashes frequently, and videos don't load half the time. LISTEN!!! Rollback to the Android version please. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY likes this update. It's been months, and you can't take a hint. Don't give me an automated message, just fix it.",1
com.discord,Alesia Green,"The app is rather buggy a lot of times and it would seem that even sharing basic videos is too much to ask from an app. Honestly have tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times just to see if it would run normally. A lot of basic features for literally any texting app are rather reserved for people who can afford $9.99usd a month. Don't get me wrong, it's a good app to mess with friends and stuff on. Still have friends who text me and say that they might not text because hackers.",2
com.discord,Justin D,"This app used to be fine, but has gotten MISERABLE out of nowhere. The limit for sending files is 8MB. It tells me I cannot send a video that's 4.20MB because it's ""too big"". Every video I send (still under 8MB) is horribly compressed, despite not going over the size limit. Videos sometimes just don't play unless I close and restart the app. This app has been getting absolutely terrible with each update. I would rate this 0 stars if possible.",1

Before the update, everything was okay and wasn't breaking. Now, videos won't play sometimes and I have to restart discord because every now and then, I get put in a ""Connecting..."" loop, where it ""connects"" for forever.

com.discord,Smash Bro,"Fundamentally broken. Decided to finally update after hearing the horror stories about porting the iOS version had mostly went away... and it turns out, they haven't. Uploads of multiple files, even small images, will seemingly hang forever and never actually finish, though uploading the exact same files one-at-a-time is near instantaneous.

com.discord,Laiba Ali,"As an aspiring UX designer, I have to say - Discord is a VERY friendly app. From ease of use, organization, and server control options, it's the perfect way to connect with friends, be aware of events, or even just organize your own thoughts. There are a few bugs here or there (recently I've had some trouble tapping+holding messages to react or respond to them) but they are always being fixed and improved upon. Succinctly put: I'm very fond of Discord!",5
com.discord,Cat Rose,"I love the layout of this app and the privacy features. My one complaint is the quality of calls. The audio tends to be glitchy, especially on laptops (echos, cutting out, and other weird noises) The video quality can also be glitchy and tends to freeze. Another complaint I have is the compression of files although I understand the hassle to have premium features since Discord has no ads. I'd say the app can be mildly inconvenient at worst. Messages send much faster than most other apps as well.",4
com.discord,F. A. MURPHY,"Well, I've created some very wonderful and...interesting things. There are still a few bugs that need work. Certain styles give weird results.

I do love the fact you can now have a stream pop-out so you can message instead of exiting to message. Other than that, it's alright, would love to see Discord optimized though.",3
com.discord,Lucy Christine,"An absolute cesspool 10/10 No but in reality, I use this to text with my long distance friend.

It's like another part of my life at this point and I wouldn't want to do without it. That being said, their updates are really breaking their own system. But to their credit, a lot of what has broke has been fixed. But there are still a large number of UI bugs compared to it's old system. And questionable UI designs.",3

A gif was posted in the last channel I was in and it's endlessly crashing every time I open the app. Outside of the bug from the latest update, I hate the new design that they've gone with. Scrolling through text channels feels awful for landscape, it feels like you need to make a perfect swipe down or up otherwise the info bar on the right is going to try to pop out, which is very disruptive.",1
com.discord,Ashlyn T.,"I've used discord for a long time and I've had very few issues with it. However, I find it extremely inconvenient that Nitro can't be managed on mobile devices.

But the app itself and ability to build within it is easy enough to learn and manage. Participating in servers is usually user friendly. Overall love the app.,4
com.discord,trever clark,I love discord and I've used it for years but after I was forced to update it I've realized this new update is terrible. Discord freezes all the time and crashes when I try to send videos or open certain servers. My gallery has been looping as well when I scroll for some odd reasons as well. I preferred the older version and I hope that if this new UI is kept that they continue to improve it because it's barely usable in it's current state.,2
com.discord,Trev Rey,"The app overall has been great but recently there's been some really troubling issues with half of the channels just disappearing, things taking forever to load, and my connection just flat out not working regardless of how long I leave it on and all of this seemed to have a massive spike with both the lag and the connection issues after the latest update. If it gets fixed I'll change my rating but till then it's a very big issue for me.",3
com.discord,Ethan Mills,"The app itself is fine, honestly one of the best communication apps I've ever used, however as of late, me and a couple of friends have had this issue where video files just have their audio completely replaced with an extremely harsh and loud static sound. It's not the end of the world but it's still extremely annoying as one friend of mine has been having this problem for months while I have just recently started to.",3
com.discord,Lakek,"Remove the newest overhaul, it doesn't make things easier and makes it significantly harder to navigate, especially with how quickly it throws you into a vcs text chat making it hard to even exit those screens. The text is now too large to the degree I can't read it too, and the scaling doesn't fix it since it's the actual icon/dm title text. Laggy to the point I've had to reset my phone three times as well, and it's hard to leave call when the VC is below everything bc of how the notifs changed",1
com.discord,Xana The Dark,"Functions enough on a base level but they completely broke the push to talk feature for voice chats. Sometimes it toggles like it should, and sometimes it stays on permanently after a single tap of the button. They also changed it to make a noise play when you tap the button which results in the other people in the chat hearing that noise everytime you try to speak, not sure why anyone would think that's a good idea.",2
com.discord,Tyler Poulin,"Not being able to share videos FOR TWO STRAIGHT WEEKS since the last update because Discord hangs at ""compressing files"" every time is pretty lame. Really scrolling up dozens of posts in the chat for no reason is annoying. Not following the text cursor when typing, forcing me to scroll down to see what I'm typing, which then - for reasons unknown - causes the text cursor to move to the end of the previous line is basically cancer. Don't roll out updates if you haven't tested them.",1
com.discord,Max McNabb,"it's a game that I've been playing for years at this point, and i recently switched from iphone to samsung. whenever i have bluetooth headphones on while joining game that has vc, the audio output goes to my phone. Ive been looking for a solution for this problem, but I've been unsuccessful. I'd really like to find a way to fix it, or if it's a bug on roblox's end",3
com.discord,Sam Jones,"The latest update changed the font style for usernames/nicknames, made the text smaller, and put all the channels closer together. It's a lot less accessible if you have any kind of vision issues since everything is now smaller, closer together, and harder to distinguish. Also the app keeps crashing and failing to load images/texts.",3
com.discord,Jathan Martin (Arthur Ritis),"Super laggy, message links don't work 90% of the time, videos/photos dont upload half the time after compressing especially if theres more than one at a time, and compression is counter-intuitive. Ill send a 3MB video and it compresses it to make it 8MB, seems kinda backwards right? Videos turn to static, crashes doing anything (opening profiles, going to settings). Discord has a simple purpose and can't even do it right.",1
com.discord,NovaTheEnby,"Updated my app last night and messages no longer send/delete smoothly. Please fix this bug, it's very rough on the eyes. I've preferred discord mobile for years because the smooth movements were easier to look at on screen and now they're glitching and are gone. I can't find anything to fix it in settings. I also can't disable bold names or make the message box smaller. Message display margins broke too and they are now shown further apart than they're supposed to be. Discord is usually great.",1
com.discord,Branden Ong,"Worked fine when I had an Apple device, but now that I'm using an Android I've been riddled with issues with the app. Video calls freeze, no exaggeration, every 10-15 seconds, forcing me to exit out of fullscreen and reenter back in so that it unfreezes. And most recently, I can't even see the tabs at the bottom which allow me to go to my friends list or settings. Very unhappy with this and it makes me wonder if Discord employees have Android users at all.",1
com.discord,Jonah Jeleniewski,"Since the switch to react native, the experience has been horrid. It's visually uglier than the native app. The UX feel is jankier than the native app. You launch the app or switch back into it and are immediately greeted with ""Connecting..."" and a shameful laggy load of recent chats. Sometimes the aforementioned ""Connecting..."" decides to just never ""connect"" despite being on strong WiFi. The list goes on.",1
com.discord,Morgan Zamzow,This review is to reflect the latest update. THE APP IS BARELY USABLE RIGHT NOW. Any time I minimize the app I need to hard restart it to use it upon maximization. It is so unstable and crashes very frequently. I am on the latest version of the app and android. Over the past couple weeks I've just watched these issues get worse. I'm not sure who asked for this or thought this overhaul was a good idea but it feels like a massive step backwards. Profiles look strangely zoomed in when previewing.,1
com.discord,Stahp,"Constantly having problems with this version. And not just the annoying ""connecting"" issue where the app refuses to work and had to be closed and reopened. Many times I'll type a response, send, it appears to post, then I find out later that discord ate my messages. ALSO, nearly all the buttons/icons/emojis/status dots/anything that is a graphic is not displaying. I've tried restarting the app, force stop + clearing the cache, and restarting my phone, but so far nothing has helped. üíÄüíÄüíÄ",1
com.discord,Rachel White,"Good app for big group/team communications. Allows for different channels with different permissions to help ease control of content. It's not the most intuitive for those managing channels though. As a captain on a club team I often needed to create new channels, assign roles, post announcements, etc. and this was not always easy to get the right people to see the right info with the right permissions. However, overall pretty good app. Will continue to use it. Custom emojis are pretty fun.",4
com.discord,Nate Robertson,"Not sure what happened recently but the app has been performing terribly. Failing to connect is the primary issue on my end, waiting for minutes at a time as the app simply states ""Connecting..."". Two stars because once it finally connects it's not so bad, but still seems to struggle with performance.",2
com.discord,J√§ger Bomb,"4-5‚ú®Ô∏è I've been a happy camper on discord since 2018, thankfully ive had little to no issues. But the most recent update has brought quite a few. I tried trouble shooting it myself but my main issue is that, when I'm on a video call, the videos from others in the call freeze or won't load every 30 to 60 seconds. I can usually the videos back if I minimize the call.",4
com.discord,Crystal Hay,"New update constantly crashes on mobile, and I get notifications only half of the time. I unintentionally ghost people because I just never get a notification from them. The crashing is multiple times a day and there's no option to send a report. Pressing down on messages to react to them is also acting weird, too. Very annoying and would love to see a fix to these. Edit to my review: Updated the app like they said to do and even reinstalled it. Still crashes.",1
com.discord,alpha wolf,"the new layout looks amazing! but it sort of broke the app for me. Channel names will be either completely gone or the words will be out of place, and its really slow for some reason? it isn't my phone. this has never happened before while using the app. it's most definitely because of the update. it will freeze while im trying to type or trying to switch between servers and stuff.",3
com.discord,Sashkin Pashkin,"After the major overhaul back in early September or late August, everything has been consderably worse in quality. I cant send multiple photos at once anymore, even with super duper fast internet! It just breaks and doesnt send. My stream quality is super bad and only runs at like 2 fps, which is again not the fault of my device(s) or my internet. Ive said this once and Ill say it again, dont reinvent the wheel, it was perfect before the overhaul, please go back to the older version.",1
com.discord,Sabo (8l172),"Not sure what they did to the app but it is awful to use now. It takes around 4-6 minuted to load into a single server/group chat/DM because you get stuck at the ""Connecting..."" Message at the top; Sending photos is even worse as you have to press the send button at least 3 times to get it to send, and even then it usually crashes the app (same issue happens with sending nornal text messagws but it hasn't crashed me, yet). Edit: Now I can't see peoples names or online status as its stoll bugged.",2
com.discord,Devastator325,"Way worse ever since the early August update, took two months to go back to the old image system that worked perfectly fine. Discord is a prime example of incompetent developers breaking things that worked perfectly fine before, or changing things that didn't need to be messed with, and this time it seems to be just because they were lazy, and didn't want to work on two separate codebases for IOS and Android respectively. They still compress mobile images with the option for that turned off",1
com.discord,Kylee Cameron,"My review was 5 stars for years. Now I feel generous giving 3. Since the last big update, Discord does not work properly. At least twice a day, Discord will say it has lost connection for no apparent reason and it takes its good ol time reconnecting. The search feature no longer works at all. As a moderator this has made things 10x more difficult. For voice and video, setting output to default doesn't do anything. I have to manually change it every time. Tldr; do better.",3
com.discord,Coyotezzz,"Gif-finder, upload gallery, video watching all unusable due to lag. Sometimes attempting to download an image doesn't work. Easy to get flooded with notifications. Clearing pings takes too long. Emoji sorting system is counterintuitive. Impossible to tell server folders apart. Text size and spacing is atrocious, zoom function doesn't help. Features irrelevant to me are unhidable. Only reason I'm still using this is because Discord is essential to my life and older APKs are now broken.",1
com.discord,S. Quinn,"This is the best app for everything from small chat servers with friends to big public servers. Voice is clear and easy on the data, and you can smoothly move from using it on your phone to using it on your computer. The only thing I don't like is that it's a little kludgy if you want to re-share an image or gif that has been shared in Discord, because it gets turned into a Discord link, but it's not hard to work around that.",5
com.discord,Grey Cruz,Love the app but the newest update sucks. The font is too small or too big no matter how many times I've tried to fix it. When messaging a friend it asks if you want to report them before the chat loads. My slide for photos doesn't even load well. Edit: Now another problem I have is that I can't even log on. It says that my email doesn't exist or the password/ email is wrong,3
com.discord,James Keo,"Whether it'd be from a recent update or not, the current UI is absolutely scuffed compared to the previous. Some functions, such as checking emote origins/descriptions/users, are missing. Text and voice channels go missing, or covered up past a certain point frequently. Things just aren't as functional as they were previously.",2
com.discord,Michael Renna,"Updating to version 147.16 ruined a lot of what I use Discord for, removing options and features for no apparent reason, namely image compression. Previous versions of the app let you turn that off in the settings, there are *videos* of people showing where that setting used to be. So since I can no longer change that (with it being turned on permanently,) I tried to cancel my nitro subscription. Thing is, you CAN'T DO THAT on the app anymore either! Why would that be removed??",1
com.discord,kiielmao,"before the recent update, everything was good and easy to navigate and use. Now, there are bugs that makes me frustrated. There's this thing where if I upload a funny video, the audio turns into static noises and it annoys me augh. that's the only thing that I want to be fixed right now, cus it's not very enjoyable.",2
com.discord,Chloe Taylor,"The newest update wiped my favorite emoji list so I had to redo that, and of course the app is slow and buggy right now. 11/14/22 Update: the app is still buggy and slow, and its the only app doing this. The keyboard takes 10 years to recognize my inputs, and when it does, its often incorrect inputs. I would give this app no stars if I could. The devs did not help me",1
com.discord,Faera Rathion,"I would've given this 5 stars a few months ago, being a long time user, but these recent updates have made the app extremely frustrating to use. I get randomly put into channels when I open the app, they scroll me back sometimes hundreds of messages, it's impossible to see all the channels in some Discords, doesn't clear notifications without having to try to fully scroll through a channel I was mentioned in to the point of having to refresh it multiple times and many more consistent issues.",1
com.discord,Thomas Angus,"Ever since an update they released about a year ago, the app has steadily become worse, and my opinion on the app has also decreased. The first bad update prevented me from watching 90% of the video files uploaded to the app. That was fixed, but only a few weeks later. Every update has had some sort of problem. One of the more recent ones creates a 50/50 chance the app will just not work, and I have to restart the app. For now, I give the app 2 stars until it is finally fixed.",2
com.discord,Avoxx Nepps,The new update has made it borderline unusable. It is extremely glitchy and a lot of times doesn't even work properly. Can't even join a voice call without it leaving and rejoining by itself or muting me for unknown reason. The new video system absolutely sucks. All of the minor inconveniences the previous version had is nothing compared to this update which looks like it was thrown together by a team of teenagers in Middle School in a month for a school project.,2
com.discord,Arthur Ford,"Entire UI was changed for the worse. There isn't any animation when receiving messages now. UI is much more laggy and some animations seem to not even support 120hz anymore. I enjoy the app for the most part, but would very much like to see some of these changes reverted or at least an option to revert them client side. I have since been prompted by the app to give a review even though these issues persist. I would like to see older features added back such as communication mode toggles.",1
com.discord,True Night's Edge,"I am having an issue where if I try to send more than 1 attachment at a time it will clear the first phase of it uploading, but then during the second phase it will freeze at around 2% and it won't send the attachments.

I can no longer save images, it gives me the ""Save failed, please check system network and privacy settings for photos app"" I have tried multiple solutions to this, including uninstalling and reinstalling. Still not",3
com.discord,Goodra,"The Discord app used to be great, but recently they've run it into the ground because they're trying to push Nitro subscriptions. My available photos don't update when I take pictures, half the time when I try to send a photo it rapidly selects and deselects the one I tap, the app forces my phone to mute and unmute when I open it while in a phone call even if I'm just in a text channel, the app frequently puts me in random DMs when I open it instead of the DM I was last in, and more. 0/10",1
com.discord,Daniel Kaspo,"Can no longer upload videos. I manually compressed my videos but now the app tries re-compressing them and they turn out 10x bigger (5mb turned into 50mb!!) This prevents me from uploading a lot of small video files! On top of that, everything feels like it animates and moves at 30fps when it previously was buttery smooth. Sharing things is such a hard thing to do. I can't edit the message well in the single text box for sharing. I'm avoiding the mobile app like the plague.",1
com.discord,Time Escaped,"I love this app because there is just SO much potential with it. I feel it's not necessarily the easiest to navigate due to the bot system but that's just about it. I think having a nice, little manual to always have access to would be helpful but overall a great app. Also could recommend a little bit of an easier system with trying to add friends since some people make it impossible to friend due to funny fonts in the usernames.",5
com.discord,Laster Caster,"Getting worse all the time. Thanks for firing your Android team, by the way. Your iOS team has really delivered an excellent challenge to those who need accessibility.

com.discord,Financial Professionals,"After the Oct 3 update, everything sucks. I can't upload more than one image at a time, the keyboard lags whenever I try to type more than 3 words, the media menu that comes up when you want to select media requires you to use your device's back button to get out of it, when before it had an easy little down arrow in-app, and when I scroll up to look at past messages and hit the arrow to return to the most recent one, it doesn't just snap there like it used to, it scrolls down, taking longer.",2
com.discord,Girlfriend FNF,"Discord overall is amazing, and I don't mind how PC users get more features [as it's easier to add to PC] but recently I've been having issues. Before the most recent update, Discord would randomly stop loading messages and I'd have to completely close out discord and re-open it to see new messages. That always worked, but was extremely annoying, so I checked for updates and updated it... now Discord won't even open no matter what I try.",3
com.discord,Orel,"I dont know what happened but the app has been terrible. Constant freezing, I can only send one image at a time and when I go into my gallery while in a call the whole app crashes but the call continues until I force stop it or try opening it like 10 times to no avail. I don't have these issues on PC, but the mobile is practically unusable.",2
com.discord,Sophie Harrison,"New font is horrendous. The old one is fine, there was no need to update it. It just looks like something that would come out of a word document, so I'm refusing to update discord until that font is either removed or can be changed. Also, there's so many bugs.

Unsure what could be causing the new issues, it is my main way to communicate with people so the lag is rather frustrating when trying to move between conversations.",1

Even aside from that, the app is complacent being a lackluster substitute for the (also worsening) desktop version, lacking extremely basic features (like copying text from statuses/bios ?), inconsostent performance for seemingly no reason, and needlessly complicated UI & settings that sometimes don't work, making it a pain to talk to friends with lives through no fault of their's, consistently. A shame",1
com.discord,Bradley Talley,"Issues that I have encountered in the last week: -Push notifications do not send when screen is locked -when pushes are sent, they are sent in bulk. Then when tapped, the app opens but the messages do not appear until app is restarted -when sending an image, new images do not update until the app is restarted -keyboard auto opens on dms, can type, but cursor is not on the text, can't backspace until the textbox is selected",2
com.discord,Tommy Walker,"I never had a problem with the app until the last month or so. Now I have channels that won't mark themselves as read after they've been viewed, server channel lists that don't populate until I scroll the list around, pictures that won't load, etc. It's not unusable, but given how high quality the app has been until recently, it's frustrating.",2
com.discord,Your chunky foot fungus,"Everything works pretty well! I haven't had any problems in voice calls and I can talk to my friends easily. Though when they or I send a video, I can't hear the audio; so I have to download the video and then I can hear the audio. I've checked my settings multiple times and my earbuds and speaker don't have anything wrong.",4
com.discord,Mary,"Everything works fine for the most part, except they took away the ability to add photos to the chat via your clipboard on mobile. That was the only way I could spoiler pictures. Now I can only send pictures if I go to my gallery, select the picture, click share, select Discord, then search for the channel I want to send it to (this option won't give me the option to spoiler pictures) Much more tedious than just saving a picture to your clipboard and adding it that way.",3
com.discord,Kuro,"The new UI is HORRIBLE. All text looks smaller, categories are closer together, the notifs at the top of the screen just float there *and* you can no longer save a notif by swiping down because that removes it now. I only didn't give one star because the platform still WORKS, I just wish I didn't have to use it now. EDIT : It ALSO reset my notification settings set by my phone settings for it, so I'm getting notifs from servers popping up on my screen. I've changed my mind about two stars.",1
com.discord,Eric Wood,"Almost perfect platform, I rairly have issues with discord and most of the time they are resolved quickly. The one issue I do run I to is when I try to upload a photo taken on a modern phone at 108MP I get a poop emoji on both the preview picture and the original when you click on it. Tried nitro and still have an issue. Also tried support and unfortunately they say it's a limitation. So remember to take a nice photo and a lesser quality photo if you think it will go onto discord.",4
com.discord,Christian Twichell,"I hate the new android update. It's slow, glitchy, I don't like that it doesn't save the specific time of messages. Can't send more than one file/image/gif, it begins sending but never loads or actually sends in. I dislike that you can't send videos because of the nitro subscription. I understand it, I just dislike that those who can't pay have much less freedom. But I do love the video chat screen shrinking and staying up when multitasking features. Its just not as smooth anymore. Please fix it",3
com.discord,Charles,"Absolute garbage on most recent update. It notifies you of messages in Android auto with no way to turn the notifications off, making android auto unusable with the stream of notifications . Any time you attempt to send multiple files in a single message it hangs after processing the first file. Notifications are completely unreliable. Terrible keyboard hangs and frame lag when scrolling are extremely aggravating. I find myself not talking to friends because the app is so terrible to use.",1
com.discord,Edward Lorrain,"Bad app, but everyone uses it :/ A lot of bugs on my end. Currently won't update attachments for long periods of time, making it annoying to send screenshots or photos to my friends. Each 'response' to this telling me to update the app just proves Discord doesn't care; either the response team doesn't care or is overworked by people who don't care. Cache builds up >1gb so fast; app slows down ridiculously.",1
com.discord,Willy Pete (Willy Pete),"Overall I like this app. The various levels and tools available for organization are phenomenal, the colors aren't hard on my eyes, and it's easy to navigate through the app. If I can't figure out how to use a stylized font like strikethrough it's easy to Google the commands or formatting I need.",4
com.discord,Tanky Crobat,"Newest update for October: the buttons for the call overlay is back again. On top of that, when flipping between inner screen and outer screen, it adjusts the app sizes nice. The last thing that could be fixed, and I don't know if this is a discord thing, but when I'm on discord call and switch to audio based social media like TikTok or YouTube, audio settings ""adjust"" microphone and speaker sounds just for being on the app. If that can get fixed. I'll give this a five star.",3
com.discord,Evan mortensen,"Notifications no longer swipe away the way they used to, DM pings show up as 2 notifications instead of one. Emotes don't always work when you hit them, and server switching is laggy and jarring. Sometimes the server members list pops up when trying to send a message. Unlike most I'm optimistic about the changes, but this definitely should have been tested and bug fixed before they switched the UI.",2
com.discord,"You Slumber, Cucumber","Android version used to be better before the update a lot of Android users talked about. Before, I had no problems. Now, there's moments where I have to flip my Wi-fi off and on to get chat to work. Usernames and profile pics are slow to update on servers, the file/image uploading menu is too small, doing something(?) causes the keyboard to pop up incessantly and requires closing and reopening the app to fix it, and overall things feels slower and glitcher than they did before the update.",3
com.discord,Peter Kelley,"Used this app for years but with the latest series of updates I am forced to use my computer. My device (Asus ZenPad) is an older one and after the changes it is highly unstable. Changing servers or channels too fast? Stops responding. Typing out more than 3 words? Stops responding. Browsing too long? Stops responding. It is virtually unusable in this state where I am constantly forced to use my devices ""power & boost"" function to free up ram in an effort to not crash. Old version was better",1
com.discord,ThatPinhead,"While I find most of the application usable, the issue lies in the fact that it cannot send images properly. I send an image to a channel or private conversation, and it sits in a ""queue"". The queue ""loads"" all the way, but the image doesnt send. Only when I turn my wifi off and turn on my cellular data, does the image send. Even then, I cannot send more than one image at a time. It is not a huge issue, but if it involves the programming of the app, please fix it to your earliest convenience.",3
com.discord,JustJack,"With the newest update to the mobile version of discord it has been an absolute nightmare. Random crashes, videos not playing sometimes requiring you to close and re-open the app, making sending media absolute hell with limiting how low you can scroll and how it consistently resizes the attach file menu. I have no clue why you ever decided to change anything, in my honest opinion the old version we had was perfect, no bugging issues the layout was fine I could stuff freely. Anyway. please fix-it",1
com.discord,Nicholas Brown,"Great, I just hit the update button and am deeply regretting it. It's extremly laggy now and prone to crashing on my device, likely because it's an older one. I wish you guys were considerate of people with less powerful devices, but I know I'm just shouting in the dark with that comment. Edit: Wow, on top of all that, now any videos I send, the audio just corrupts into what sounds like extremely loud static. Edit 2: Actually posted a bug report before the devs answ. we'll see if it gets fixed.",2
com.discord,PandaMonium,Every time I try and use my phones camera to live stream myself the video freezes after a few minutes and then the screen just goes black with a loading symbol. I can still hear everything but can't see anything. This is only a problem on mobile. It happens to myself and two of my discord friends. Anytime I use pc I never have an issue. Please fix its been this way ever since the new update!,2
com.discord,Joe McKenzie,"Continued adventures in the new non-native version: Call ringing sound played through my Bluetooth headset, but when I answered the other person's voice played loudly through the phone speaker! I hung up, disconnected and reconnected the headset. Then I rejoined and it worked properly. When we both hung up, the green ""connected"" bar at the top remained. I repeatedly tap the hang up button but nothing happens. Other person comes back and it plays through the phone speaker. Output device select???",1
com.discord,Morx Da Grape,"Redoing for the current update: It's improved since my last review, but the push notifs tend to not work. The app is still generally sluggish compared to the versions before the UI change. Also still some bugs. To touch back on the push notif issue, they worked before the UI change. I dunno what was changed for them to just not work, but it's a little annoying to not know when a friend replied to me.",2
com.discord,TJ Wilson,"Discord is an app I use very frequently whether it is on my PC or on my phone to keep in contact with communities and friends. For the app, I've enjoyed the features quite a bit and it is a really good mobile companion app. The only thing keeping this rating from a perfect score is that the voice chat functions can be ""hit or miss"". Other than that, great app!",4
com.discord,Zenixark,"I cannot fathom how awful the quality of this app has become, desktop and mobile... imagine a place, where instead of adding any useful or highly-asked-for features for server owners, they add endless amounts of bugs, crashes, errors, there is no escape. This genuinely may be the buggiest app I have ever seen, and don't even get me started on the desktop versions bugs... it's like the devs just gave up on the integrity of their service and only cares to add 1 feature (mostly nitro only) a year..",1
com.discord,"Nebulous Seriphim, Paranoid Obelisk",Fix the update please. It's still so so so bad. I can't send images and I'm an artist hahaha. I've been on discord on the old format pre update until it couldn't support it anymore. Now I'm updated again and it's so awful. Why did you update it? None of the changes are useful. Everything is annoying. As a wall text typer the red number limits are actually worse. Trying to use certain features crashes the app. Some things are way to small now and don't change with size adjustments.,1
com.discord,Nikita Ficklin,I love discord it's great for socializing and making friends however I HATE the last update it did seemingly nothing exept make things harder for me. One of my servers has a ton of categories and tons of channels within each one and the categories keep dissappearing and I keep having to remake them and put the channels back where they belong. This is where the update makes things difficult. After the update it got harder to move the channels around so it's nearly impossible to fix things.,2

This app has been completely destroyed and is almost totally non-functional at this point.",1
com.discord,Seth CH,"Since the new update, a few things have been fixed but I still have some issues. Images are still compressed and and load weird, same with GIF's. Sometimes my messages won't send at all despite having a strong wifi signal, sometimes they don't even show up, even tho I know I entered a message and sent it. Audio calls are weird and sometimes it won't let me mute and unmute at all. Also message requests They're great and all but I don't get notified for them, please fix this.",1
com.discord,Lumsy A,"The recent upgrade made this app unusable unless I'm on wifi. It just hangs and keep saying Connecting. Useless when I'm away from home which is not good. I need to use it daily and frrquently when I'm out and about. We need to have this bug fixed ASAP. I thought it was something wrong with my phone, I called my carrier and troubleshoot for a while still nothing. I removed several apps on my phone just to free up tons of space thinking it was a storage. or memory problem. Others have the problem",1
com.discord,Joshtheostrich,"The updates have only made it less stable and more prone to crashes, I have to close and relaunch the app at least twice before it finally decides to load, if you use any other app or anything while in a call you get disconnected, the menus will sometimes glitch causing images too be way to big and the only way to fix it is closing and opening the app. Please fix your app discord",3
com.discord,KrakenKing,"Most recent update trashed the Android version. Channel lists disappear and take forever to load, swipe on some screens doesn't even work, it just wants to slide up or down. Channels hang really bad and loading is a nightmare now. Apple does not have these issues with the update and they have had it longer. Makes using the app a chore.",1
com.discord,E B,"The Aug. & Sept. update for this app is awful, I wish I could go back. The biggest headache is how slow this app is. Log into discord on Edge if you want a collapsable side bar and higher speed. On the app the time log info is not always accessible--you need to go on PC to see all of the times messages are sent because some times are missing. I need to access time logs for D&D games and the side bar gets annoying when I am playing games in split screen. Apple's version of the app is much better.",2
com.discord,Kaitlyn Nelson,"Discord is something I use a lot to chat with friends, but I have some complaints about the new update. Mainly that it seemingly no longer has a single mute for all notifications. Every time someone DMs me I have to mute them individually, which is frustrating. Edit: Changed the review to 4 stars instead of 3 because I resolved some issues, but now I and others I know are unable to send multiple photos at once. 2+ just gets stuck on ""Uploading"" until Discord eventually auto deletes it.",4
com.discord,SketchyKey,"The app was good before the update. Now, anytime I get off Discord (even for a few seconds), it's always reconnecting as if I lost connection to wifi, despite my phone using service or having a wifi connection. And the new UI is overly animated and sometimes slows everything down. (Edit 10/09/22): Now I can't download images or videos directly from Discord, instead I get a message telling me to ""Check my system network and privacy settings for the Photos app"" which is super vague.",2
com.discord,Sebastian Conant Guy,"Discord has been my go to app for a long time, but as of the recent update cycle, there have been major issues. These include camera feeds freezing on mobile, discord freezing several hours in the past and refusing to update, and minor quality of life downgrades, such as the camera no longer broadcasting while using another app. It was working just fine before, but somehow y'all broke it and refuse to just roll back your updates. 2 stars for the memories, but no more until you fix your app.",2
com.discord,Yuri Borden,"It a really nice app, and I've had little to no issues, however I do get an issue occasionally when I'm on a discord call. The screen won't work, a it will blackout and flicker, but I'm on so few calls it hardly matters. It might even be my phone anyway. This is delightful and thrilling to talk to friends and such. There are servers, friends, people to talk to across the world. Rest assured, I believe that you can enjoy this app too.",5
com.discord,Nerdy Dude,"5 star service, 2.5 star app. Image sharing is a nightmare in the update and the app doesn't accept shares from outside the app. Also, turning animations off in accessibility settings doesn't seem to actually disable them. Last but not least, during voice/video calls the app stops listening (not a connection issue, the app stops recording) and I have to change my mic back and forth between my headset and the phone. Please test releases more before pushing updates!",3
com.discord,Brandon Eason,"The most recent update has caused a bunch of bugs. It never loads my local gallery, so instead of sharing an inage by clicking the + button, I have to go to my gallery and share from there. When I switch channels, there's a 50/50 chance that the UI rescales to 2x the notnal size and I have to close the app to continue.",1
com.discord,Colin Wyvill,"I wish I could rate this higher, I'm running into multiple issues now because of the new updates, first of all whenever I take a screenshot or download something it doesn't appear in my recent images or anything all it shows me is pictures that I took using the picture function and even then the images constantly reappear and disappear like crazy, the second issue is whenever I try to make a role, I can't press x, finish, or skip this step and I have to close out of discord to chat, fix this",1
com.discord,Eclipse,"Discord has become my main means of communicating with friends. However, the recent change in colors used has caused the app to not be so easy on the eyes.

com.discord,Trisha_x167,"The new updates make discord slower and slower, I can barely send images let alone click on them without my screen freezing for 3 minutes. Not only that whenever I send videos that are less than the file limit, somehow they exceed the limit?? Old discord was better to be honest, much easier and quicker to use.",1
com.discord,Kayla Is Fandom Trash,I don't know why but for the past few discord is giving me the connecting... bar even when my connection is totally fine. First it was just a delay in sending messages but now its doing the connecting thing almost constantly and I keep restarting the app and my phone but that only solves the problem for about a couple hours. Also the new format of things isn't pleasing to see. In your status if you try and use the emoji you can only see a part of it.,2
com.discord,Arthur Hypernova,"Ever since Discord rolled out a new kind of image/video sharing update around Aug 2022, sometimes the message won't even load. Like when you loose focus of the app, the messages won't load and missing out important conversations. Clearing cache, reinstalling, clearing system cache, using a different Android device doesn't resolve the issue at all. Issue persists on different networks like with/without VPN/proxy, on WiFi/Cellular 4G and 5G. Currently the best workaround is to restart the app.",2
com.discord,SY 907,"I dont usually leave ratings but this new update is getting annoying fast. The text is smaller, the notification pop up just looks like messenger now. And now when I try pulling up my keyboard it ends up just swiping the screen left and right over and over. Or when I swipe the keyboard pulls ul instead. There's also the fact it's slower now. I can't even send two pics at once, it has to be one by one or else it just loads forever.",2
com.discord,Nicholas Carpenter,"Discord itself is obviously fantastic, hence the rating. However mobile discord does seem to not alert as frequently and can have a hard time networking. Of course, I'm not really sure how much of that is the app and how much is the way my phone handles background processes. Either way, when it is working then it's working great!",5
com.discord,Grace Payne,"Discord, I BEG OF YOU. Make an actual update fit for Android devices. The app crashes countless times. When it does work, I get no notifications, the text changes size constantly meaning I have to restart the app, which leads to more crashing, I cannot connect to anything, when I do, I get disconnected constantly, and many many other issues. I will buy nitro for 100 people if these get fixed. I am that desperate as I use this app daily. I cannot use it when it's like this Edit: Nothing fixes it",1

There used to be a setting for this but has since been removed. Photo is only a couple MBs, which even a free user can send, and I'm in wifi, but the app keeps crushing it down to a few hundred KBs in what could only be described as the worst compression I've ever seen. Have also canceled membership because why should I bother paying them for a service they won't deliver.",1
com.discord,google user,"After the update, UX has taken a nosedive. Not only is the UI worse, but the app is constantly loading, and messages often fail to send, despite being on a perfectly stable internet connection. I'm often unable to send images taken from my camera because of the 8mb upload limit: this is intermittent and leads me to believe it is up to the whim of the application whether to perform compression or not.",1
com.discord,SMARTMAN,"The app seems to be a little less buggy now, but the reason I took off one star is because before when I had the display language set to Spanish, EVERYTHING was in Spanish. This was very beneficial to me for immersion learning. Now, a lot of stuff in the app is using the system language for the phone (English). This doesn't really ruin the experience for me, but I'd still really like to have that back.",4

com.discord,Kayden Macey,"One of the best apps ever made. So much care and detail goes into Discord. I've been using it since 2017, and it's always been quick and reliable. Having multiple channels and threads for texting in a server is so useful and helps to organize discussions. My only gripe is when I use Discord on my computer and my audio doesn't go through in voice chats. This happens semi-often and is never a quick fix. But regardless, Discord is my favorite messaging app yet. Glad they keep updating it.",5

Trying to watch a video in full screen never works the first time, gotta hit back and try again and usually works the second or third time. Search function is much worse now with pages. Trying to upload a file is nerfed as well. UI looks ugly to me, like it's just small changes but I hate it. Oh yeah, launching discord also puts me in random servers or pms I hadn't been on in weeks.",1
com.discord,Vex,"Discord is great, for chatting/connecting. I don't know of a better message service, currently. But the UI could use work, both on desktop & mobile. There's a lot of wasted, blank space that causes both versions to take up too much room. Beyond that...Nitro is too expensive for what it offers. I enjoy the ability to use custom emojis...but that's worth $2 a month, max. The image/text size restrictions for free use are way too small, and the other features are useless to me.",4
com.discord,Sleepy Panda,"Usually works just fine for my simple purposes - doesn't want to work at my job, but that's probably because of selective signal jammers and isn't Discord's fault. Sub-categories would be cool, but I imagine that community request has been ignored for years for a reason. ^^; I don't watch clips or videos much, or attach files too often, so I haven't run into the bugs I've heard complaints about, but hopefully that gets sorted out.",4
com.discord,Wyatt Elam,"Within the last month, this app has started having unusable glitches and bugs that happen constantly, like you can't attach more than 1 file at a time even if it's below the 8mb limit, if you upload videos it will completely nuke the sound, notifications show up hours after you should've got it, it will mark messages as unread even though you just opened it, the animations are slower and clunkier, none of these problems existed in the past, and they haven't been fixed at all since appearing",1
com.discord,David Ortiz,"What a terrible update as of 9/16/2022. The layout is ugly, gifs keep crashing or do not work at all, text sending does not transition properly (almost as if the app is struggling to send message). Plus, everything is big!

com.discord,Zipper Stripper,App became absolutely horrible for Android. I tried waiting a bit to see if the updates would fix it but there's always some new problem that shows up and it's getting on my nerves.

com.discord,Ricky Hernandez,"After a few updates none of these was fixed. After the update it made the app so inconvenient to use on my fold. Granted I'm a minority but this wasn't an issue prior to the update. The app doesn't know if I'm in tablet mode or phone mode anymore until I close the app completely. Not to mention simple things that isn't specific to my phone like pressing and holding to try to reply or edit, navigating channels, and posting a gif has become more difficult to do for some reason to name a few things",2

No longer really compatible with the multi-window function; Before, discord would adjust to the side required by the multi-window function. Now, it refuses to change sizes and is rendered unusable when you use multi-window because the send button gets cut off.It crashes more.

com.discord,Aku,"With this new update things have just gotten worse. Discord is more buggier than ever, not to mention sending pictures is a pain now. It keeps saying it's compressing my images and never sending. Same goes for videos, if I send videos in portrait form it just scrunches it up and ruins the quality. With calling you can no longer turn your screen off and still have you camera on. As well as there is a huge delay with Overlay and how it shows you when you've spoken. Please Discord fix your app.",2
com.discord,Morgan Freeman,"Ever since the last big update, everything has been a buggy mess. I have to reload everything if I want my notifications to go away. The gallery doesn't like to load my newest photos. If I choose to go back to an old message, it will load me back onto that message every time I click on the chat unless I restart Discord.

com.discord,Hayashi XIII,One of the easiest ways to chat with friends hands down. I've been using Discord for around the last 8 years and staying in touch with friends has been really smooth. It's also probably the best system to use while playing games with friends. I'm about to graduate college and having class discord servers has helped immensely with keeping up to date and getting to know people.,5
com.discord,Robynn.Ninjah,"Love this app. I think that the price is fair for the nitro, particularly if you use it for group activities like DnD or game nights, but the free version is great too. It's easy to use, I like the keyboard shortcuts to emphasize words and sentences, and the custom emojis are always fun. Discord is my go to app for communication. Highly recommend. My ONLY wish is that I could send larger files like videos. But it's not enough of an issue to rate any less than 5 stars.",5
com.discord,Jake Mullins (NintenJake),"I've been using Discord for 4 years now and I've never had this many issues before. Since the update I've experienced multiple issues such as sending photos that I could send all at once, but now I have to send each photo individually despite me being a Nitro member that paid for Nitro! I prefer the old layout that Discord had before the update. I used to recommend Discord to every android user, but because of the update it's harder to recommend to friends who do not have it. I hope it's fixed!",3
com.discord,Ryan Nguyen,"Some weird discord beta feature that had to do with forced image/video compression had a lot of issues. The compression raised the filesize (from 5mb to 10mb one time).

One is that the app can no longer play videos, they either load a couple seconds and stop or are just black screens.

com.discord,KizzelFerrizzel,"App works just fine and sometimes even pretty well on my older device, but the newest update brought a bunch of bugs that's been really annoying. Such as the app crashing every single time I try to watch a video sent in a chat or my keyboard being stuck open till I close the app. These issues aren't present on the PC version. Please fix these fast because I don't want Discord to turn into a buggy and broken mess like modern Instagram.",3
com.discord,FrostBlueFire Frost,"App was fine until the recent update. Porting the iOS UI to Android is absolutely terrible. Messages are getting scrunched together, or when you send a message it'll show another user sent the message instead. When trying to scroll thru msgs, get white screens and lag. Whenever you click on the purple bar to jump to the first unread message, it jumps around 50 messages up. Sucks, please revert it back.",1
com.discord,Skplunkerin,"Discord is interesting when switching between desktop and mobile. Some things work better in mobile (like adding emoji reactions, where the recently used is actually correct where desktop it's not), and some things are worse in mobile (like clicking notifications to be taken to that message, but it doesn't and you lose the message and have to try manually finding it using the broken search input), and bad in mobile and desktop (msg scroll position is never where you last were, very disorienting)",3
com.discord,Evelynn,"I've been using Discord for several years now, and even though some of the visual updates make it feel like someone has gone into your house and moved your furniture by just an inch or two to make you stub your toe consistently, it's still the best messaging app I've ever downloaded. (But please change the status emoji back to the in-app display, or at least make it so it's not so awfully tiny and cut off.)",5
com.discord,Rowan Emie,"I absolutely loved this app up until the newest updates, it's new interface is clunky and annoying to work with, it's constantly crashing, and it's lack of emotes for webhooks has made using discord with my disorder very frustrating. I really wish they'd go back to the old interface it worked wonderfully the way it did before without it scrambling around all its features.",1
com.discord,Charlie Curtis (charlie11459),"Using WiFi with +400mbps (and reinstalled app) PC version works great but this one struggles so hard when scrolling, scrolls by itself while I'm trying to read a message and I completely loose my spot, also going into my mentions and clicking a message it struggles to scroll back to it and sometimes doesn't make it. Pretty much unusable.",1
com.discord,Ava Carrier,"I love this app because of how selective you can be with what you see, unlike so many other social platforms that just throw whatever is popular on your feed. It makes for a really safe environment. The private messaging and friend systems also add to that. It's overall a great experience. Never had a single complaint about anything.",5

com.google.android.apps.messaging,Faith Bono,"This app just saved me tons of stress, time, having to screen shoot messages and printer ink and paper since it automatically allows me to see my texts on my laptop. Thank you so much for that. I do have a few suggestions tho. While I love that I can block people from texting me and then go peek to see what they say, I don't like that I'm still notified that they texted me. I also don't like that I can't set backgrounds to contacts or make changes to the text bubbles. It's kinda bland.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Matthew Lemmers,"This application has definitely managed to get much better and more feature rich over the last couple of years. One thing I noticed with one of the server side updates is that the sound which plays when a message is sent has changed. Not a huge deal, but why not give different options? Also including an option to vibrate when a message is sent as well. A popular sms app ""next sms"" already has this and it is a very nice touch to have.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Chris Allen,"I feel like it's a 2.5 cause the main job of a messaging/texting app is to send and receive texts. But it gets stuck in a sending look when it's set to chat so I have to force it to change to text instead of messaging. But then the other person's messages aren't coming through. Idk if I'm using the beta and that's why it seems so unstable and barely usable. Aside from that I don't have much issues it's customizable, I can change individual backgrounds and notifications.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Elizabeth Riviere,I am so frustrated with this app. I can't change the things I want to in Settings. There's tmi & settings for Chat Features but I don't want Chat Features. I want to have just my incoming text messages show up so I don't have to reread my outgoing messages and sift through them all to figure out who is texting me. But there is no way to select that seemingly simple option. It is so annoying. Plus I can't seem to turn off the auto correct and more often than not it guesses wrong. Useless app.,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Doug Luther,"Why can't we change the background color or be able to set pictures as the background? First time using it and feels like I'm bored with it because of the dark color. Also very annoying that the chatted stats up after you send a text plus the chat box stays up after you send a text. If you were to have the features Chomps has, this would be the best app ever.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Kayleigh Cook,"I'm suddenly having issues sending messages to people. I'm regularly receiving an error message that says ""invalid destination address"" about people whose numbers I've been texting for years, and if I send it again it goes through. I'm also not fully receiving texts. I'll get some texts sent to a group chat, but others won't come through so I'm only seeing half of a conversation. And it's not consistently one person's texts, it's random. This bug really sucks, it needs to be fixed.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Myk Overton,"Meh. The stupid sound that it makes when you send a text is really irritating...and apparently you cannot turn it off?! I like this app because of the archiving feature, but having to listen to that stupid sound each time I send a message will make me uninstall this one and go back to what came with the phone. Get rid of the sound that goes out when sending texts please...or allow us to turn it off.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Cherylynn Rios,"This app sucks. It's always in ""Connecting"" status so you have to go back in and check to make sure your messages have actually sent. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled. I've cleared the cache, tried turning on airplane mode and turning it off to reset the settings, restarted the phone etc. And it's still sits on connecting.. it's a nice app when it works, but it's not reliable AT ALL, and has caused issues because messages don't send or aren't received. Already did feedback through 3 dots!",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Daniel Mercado,"I have no idea what happened recently, but for the past few months I haven't been able to get texts as they're sent. Especially with group chats. I rely on those specifically for work, so if I can't see something, I'm screwed. Individual texts seem to work fine. It just looks like it's group texts that are slow as well as photo texts. Whatever this issue is needs to get fixed asap cuz as I said, this is for work mainly. It's getting to the point that they're wondering why I haven't fixed it. 🤦",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jon Enge,"Dev said to change ring tone for contacts. I have thousands of contacts and I just want ALL text messages to have the same sound that is different from the default. - I don't believe there's a way to change the default text message sound in this app which is important so I know what kind of notifications I'm receiving. If I'm wrong, let me know. I really like this app. Good messages, I can write th from my computer, I just wish it had likes, etc... On messages like the iPhone text app",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Mal S,"Seemed to be working great All of a sudden, my conversations won't load. I can see my list of messages. However, when I actually try to open a message/conversation, all I get is a blank screen. I was given directions to ""clear cache."" This had absolutely no effect on my issue. I still can't open and view full conversations.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,linndany,It's great and works for the most part but my only complaint is that group texts aren't automatically downloaded if data is not turned and once data is turned on you have to literally go in and download each individual text that was sent. It would be nice if it were to download itself once data is turned on rather having to click each text from each person. Otherwise this is a great app.,4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Stephen Johnston,"Unreliable. Constantly not sending messages. I used to trust messages that were sent. Now I have people think I am ignoring them and ask me a second time or call me. To resend, I have to select each message and manually change to SMS. Like others, I have looked up many articles, but nothing resolves this issue. (Including the suggestion the developer is giving below. I saw this tip replied to others having this issue, and it didn't help me at all.)",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Judy Mudore,"The upgrades that were done in November 2022 messed up my texting feature!!! I can no longer receive texts... I can send them, but no one can respond. I went through the trouble of doing a factory reset on my phone and I got some messages to come through for about an hour then nothing AGAIN!!!! Please leave things alone that work.... I'm totally frustrated!!!",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Brandon Wilson,"Good app, when it works, but for the last 2 months, I've had to keep resenting all my messages through sms/mms because the chat feature has what I think crashed to the point that I have turned it off, I haven't seen any updates for I have looked. Makes me want to revert back to my default messaging app. This all started after the November 7th update. Now, for the question of the day, will I ever hear from Google about this issue?",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Mrs. AJ Brookins,"I do not like I had no choice it took over my phone, especially without warning. The first time it made it so I could not send/receive pictures. I had to do a hard restart after trying multiple other things. NOTHING IMPROVED. The only change for the supposed better is you can use emojis on texts like iphones. I am not a fan of emojis so I do not care about this upgrade. I would prefer regular text back. It worked great for me.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,traci clemens,"Since the update on 11/21/22 my husband, friend and I are all having issues sending and receiving texts. They are severely delayed, don't mark as read once they are opened and looked at, notification icon does not go away after opened and your outgoing messages doen't show when you send them so you don't know if it went or not for a delayed period. This has caused me to send the same message multiple times. Annoying!",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jalisha Tucker,"I really like the chat features involved with this app. I'm actually sad that I can't use it anymore. Sometimes I can't receive messages. I thought my friend was ignoring me before I found out I wasn't receiving HER messages. Sometimes the app won't send messages either; I have messages saying unable to send and others pending send for DAYS. It won't allow me to send videos at times, specifically to iPhone users (I have an Android). No troubleshooting has done any good.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Ben L,I have to tap each picture to download and view. When someone sends me a bunch of pictures it makes it very annoying to handle. I made a post on the forums but no response. If I get a picture while at home on wifi there should be an option to automatically download the image. It seems developers changed the outgoing message sounds option to include both in/out texts. There's no way to just have incoming sounds now. It sounds like an iphone which is terrible thanks...,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Joe Catbagan,Like the app but noticed I don't always receive text messages sent to me or can send texts. It's so random. I first noticed 3 weeks after upgrading to a new phone I sent a text 1 morning and it said not sent. I checked if an update was needed but nothing. I had to restart my phone in order to send the text and receive messages I didn't get before. It's starting to happen more often which is bothersome and annoying. Didn't have an issue on my old phone. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but same.,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Karly Kirk,"I love that you can switch back to SMS. I will say, I do not like how videos are shared when it's through a different system. What I mean is, us Android users versus IOS. I love this app, but I wish there were ways to send videos better without having to send someone with an iPhone/IOS, a link to the video, at least thats how it appears, as a link to Google photos. Fix? Is there not a way for media to be shared across all systems, no matter the system setup (IOS/Android)? It's definitely lagging",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,D DL,"Whatever upgrades you did to the application from 6-8 weeks ago, and even now, totally messed it up 😡 I have to unpair the phone or the tablet and then reestablish the pairing in order to get the messages to sync. If you do any action like deleting or archiving a message from the phone by swiping that message it does not sync on the tablet. It results in the tablet having old messages that it can't get rid of. Somebody test this stuff before you roll it out.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Hailey Turner,"i like the app and it’s been my favorite message app so far, but it has so many bugs. whenever i put in a word in the search bar, it tells me 'no results found' even though i know there are messages with that word. the app also has trouble sending long messages. anything longer than 3 sentences won’t go through and i have to restart my phone to get the message to go through. this app needs lots of work done and hopefully will be fixed before i have to find a new messaging app",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Brian Rea,"I use this app to send mass texts. Half the time. The people don't get them. Now. It won't even let me send messages to people on my phone. Half of the time it works fine. Now II can receive messages but Just can't send them. Then all of a sudden it'll start working fine again, it's weird. I have a Google pixel 6 pro and I've taken it in. They said there's nothing wrong with it. The problem is with this app",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,candyland8903,"I keep having tons of issues with this app. I have deleted it and reinstalled it numerous times. I keep getting duplicate msgs and it will send out duplicates to recipients. I have restarted my phone every day since updating this app and I don't know what the update did, but my app has not worked right this whole month since updating it the last two times. Update since response. I cleared the cache also and I'm still having tons of issues!!!! Every since u updated the app, it has not worked!",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Kathy P,"I prefer this app over my T-Mobile message app, it's more familiar. However in the last week or so I've gone through all the troubleshooting and still can't figure out why when sending photos it now takes 10 min or more and sometimes sends it twice. Doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or data. It's a recent issue. Maybe from latest update? No problems with basic text tho. Little frustrating.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Linda SGJ,*update it's working great now😃 I stopped using my last texting app. Ok... So I really love the application but lately... I had updated it and it started crashing. It wouldn't even let me access any messages. I would open it and it would close down. I had to uninstall the updates for it to work normal. Not sure if anyone else is experiencing something like that? But just in case? Maybe the updates should be looked over? I've a pixel 3a. Thank you.,5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Sean Thomas,"So far it works, but it's not as feature rich as some other apps.. but I just got the pixel 7 pro and I haven't had an actual Google device since the early days when Google was new.. I'll update it later as I have more time to see how it works! Time will tell.. What I expected from Google I didn't get out of my grand new Samsung Galaxy tab 8+, is everything just works out of the box, without issues or complicated setup, notifications to my pixel watch.. rating can only go up!",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Colette Leirer,"It's terrible! I absolutely hate it. It says it sent a message and then later says it couldn't and I'm constantly switching to text just to get things to send. I want my previous app back and cannot find it on my phone, but it is on my husband's phone, and he has the same phone and same plan. Stop messing with what already works!",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jeremy Breckbill,"If it had the ability to personalize tones for different contacts and the ability to disable Amber Alerts I'd give this app 5 stars. In response you wrote,""...you can submit feedback within the Messages app by clicking the Menu button..."" I don't have a menu button, so I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2. When I emailed my concerns to the address you provided, your reply was, ""You have emailed an address that is no longer being monitored."" Your app support is cheerful yet awful. 2 may become 1.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Justin Harrington,"Worked great for a while...the latest update won't let me send encrypted messages to another phone that uses the same messaging...really freaking annoying. Update:. Developer I have cleared the cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, reverified my phone number for chat, and it still doesn't work. It's on your end clearly. I see several similar complaints on the reviews. Do better.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Rachel P,"Generally works well, I do occasionally have issues with it not alerting me when a message comes in and sometimes it will make me switch to SMS/multimedia or else it won't deliver my message, and that prevents me from seeing if my message has been delivered or read. My messages sometimes don't go through at all, but this is likely the cell service itself.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jen Estrada,"It was installed on my new phone and I've had trouble sending and receiving ever since. In a group text, I only got one text in the whole thread where 8 people were chatting. Sometimes it will send texts to individuals and sometimes it won't -- I get frequent ""working in the background"" messages. I've uninstalled and reinstalled with no change. The network is fine and if I switch to FB messenger for my default SMS my messages will actually send so that's what I've done for now.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Susan Hood,"This latest update does not allow me to attach photos directly from Google photos app, it automatically goes to Samsung Galaxy and I cannot fix it. It also allows you to only attach one picture at a time instead of selecting several at the same time. You have to go through the routine of clicking attachment, clicking gallery, clicking photos, then clicking on the one you want. Very frustrating.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Ermalene Hobson,"Since your recent update, I am unable to delete multiple messages at a time. Somehow, that feature doesn't exist anymore. Whenever I select a message it shows a line of emojis- why??? I can't select another conversation without deselecting the previous one - how time consuming. 🙄 Please bring back the ability to delete multiple messages at a time!!! Also having problems with the app freezing. What's up? I use to love using this app! 🙃",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Kelley Evans,"The app has worked fine until recently. Messages won't send. If I receive messages from others they are late. Sometimes I don't get them at all. Yet, if I make a call or send someone else a text all of the messages that have been lost suddenly show up. It's annoying. I even upgraded my phone due to this issue thinking my old phone was the problem. But nope. It's this app apparently. Because it's still happening.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Pamela NelsH,It's works for the most part. The thing I can't stand is the sound connected to outgoing messages. NOT THE NOTIFICATIONS!! I'm talking about the sound when you create the text and hit send. It's dull and flaccid and sounds like an error. Was that the best the developer could do?? Because wow... Please add an option to turn off the sound or change it.,3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Peter S,"Buggy, crashes, loses functionality from time to time. Pinning texts is cool, but only three at a time is limiting. The new icon is visually an annoyance, like blurry double vision. Sharing media or contacts with iphone is slow. Great for just saying hello to a friend. Developer response to reviews is lightning fast (thank you), however, I would prefer if these systems worked without having to manually manage them, clear caches, etc.. not what I'm paying for is how I feel.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,marshall rose,"It's a very good app and has very good features that my other default messaging app lacks, such as the ability to send videos over 0.3 seconds long. My one major recommendation is the ability to use chat features like replying to messages and adding reaction could be used even with people who don't have the app (if possible). Other than that I have not had a problem with group messaging.",5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Lorie F. Waters,"Weird glitch happening after most recent update--I've generally had a good experience with the app, but recently when I try to open a new message by clicking the notification bar/message preview, it jams up and won't open. When I click my back arrow, then it opens up the main app and list of all messages, and then I have to click back into the new message. Just a bit of an annoyance that I'm hoping has an easy fix!",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Parker Gordon,"I wish there was a way to view all 'unread' texts. Sometimes they get lost deep within my messages and I never respond. I feel like that's a pretty important feature that's missing, it was enough to almost make me use my phone's default message app instead (but that one had other, weirder, worse problems). Other than that it's very good, 5 stars if that feature gets added in for sure",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Michelle Taepakdee,"I can't switch the messages from Rich Communication Service (chat) to regular SMS (text), and because of that, they always fail to send. After they inevitably fail, then I get the option to switch. I've looked up dozens of help articles, and they always go through how to change the settings, but the app won't let me change the settings. It's made me extremely angry and frustrated. I absolutely loathe this app with a passion, but most of my friends don't use Whatsapp or LINE, so I'm stuck.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Kayla Villareal,"I loved this app as it was easy and convenient to use until today when my chat feature stopped working. I tried everything from turning off my wifi, to restarting my device, to checking my sim card, to using airplane mode until I had no choice, but to uninstall the updates to the app and it erased all of my message history. All of which was very important and now it's all gone. The experience, as a whole, was excruciatingly frustrating and extremely disappointing.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Nathan Gill,"Like others have mentioned, if the other party receiving a text has the same app with chat but it is shown unavailable then the message will fail to send. I don't want to be constantly checking my phone to see if a message has gone through or not. I turned on the setting where it automatically switches to SMS text if the chat fails to send but that doesn't work. If the receiver is unable to receive the chat it still does not send a text. Hours will go by before I realize it hasn't sent.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Brandon Rouse,"After this most recent update. My texts have been glitching out. For instance, if I'm at the end of my text and try to scroll back up to the beginning. The screen will start jumping up and down and becoming distorted. I have ran into other problems as well. Please run another update to fix the bugs. Text messaging shouldn't feel like you're fighting a virus just to send a simple text",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Rei Mettille,The new sort function is incredibly frustrating. I'd love to be able to label contacts as business or personal so it sorts my texts properly. Right now it just seems to send spam to business. I really think it would be great to have the ability to customize your categories as well. My phone gets overloaded with work contact and I forget to respond to personal texts because they get lost in the swarm of work texts. Just food for thought.,2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jim Stewart,"New update forces me to stare at my phone to see when i get a text while in text conversation. No notification sound! There is some non-audible disturbing sound. I want my selected notification sound to go off when ever i get a text, when i'm engaged in a text conversation as well as when the program is closed. Why send out update that cripples the usefulness of this aplication? Please fix this! Thank you!",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,g33kxx,"A few months ago I lost the ability for RCS with my husband (same model phone S21, same Google Fi service) now I no longer see anyone's name on notifications, even when they're saved in my phone. Group texts I miss some messages. I submitted a ticket after the 1st issue and haven't heard anything. I'm very frustrated to be forced to use this app (to get short texts from auto senders) but I no longer get the basic features of other messaging apps.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Bradley Carpenter,Requires data at all times. Most of the time when I'm texting I do not have my data or WiFi on just because I don't find it nessisary. In order to send or receive any messages in this app you have to have your data on. I have changed all the settings to make it auto send when not connected to data or WiFi but it doesn't help. This app sucks don't use it unless they fix this issue. Even Message + works way better then this cracked app.,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jon Simon,"Latest update is very buggy. Messages showing as drafts and ""sending"" even though they have already been sent. Archived threads coming back from the archive. Search function basically useless if it's not going to give results for words and phrases that I know exist in certain message threads but it doesn't show anything. Do better google.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Bodine,"This updated version lacks too many features compared to Apple. Unfortunately, when traveling internationally, the app can't handle transitions from country to country. Contacts in group chats would start showing only as numbers, even when adding the +1 country code in the Contact app. Spell check and word selection process is abysmal and inaccurate constantly.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Sapphire C,"For over a week my messages now ask me to resend messages for almost every message I've sent. I've restarted my phone, deleted messages, and changed my settings to automatically resend as sms or MMS, however, it doesn't do so. It still asks to tap for more options asking, to send the message as sms or MMS. This is annoying. I went to the help forum and NO RESPONSE. Time to find a new messenging app.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Raymond Wong,"After the updates, I have experienced severe delays in receiving and sending text messages. I just received a text this morning that was sent yesterday. I wonder if today's developer forget that the heart of this app is reliable communication. If the app cannot meet that standard, even with all sorts of fancy addons and it is still be useless. A phone with highend camera is useless if one cannot have clear conversation. Please fix the core issues before loaded it with fancy stuff.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Marissa Gonzalez,"Very inconsistent as far as chat goes. Frequently messes up and chat won't work. Not sure what the issue is. Update: have tried troubleshooting, still can't figure out the issue. Update: all the things I've tried: Uninstalling and reinstalling, disconnecting and reconnecting wifi, turned phone off and on, updated app, updated carrier services app, cleared cache, cleared data, spent 1.5 hours on phone with my phone company, reprogrammed phone. Nothing has worked :( two IT people tried.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,David Joseph,"Since the last update I have been unable to select and delete multiple text messages from a single conversation. It is very tedious to just select and delete one text message at a time from a conversation. Also, that line of emojis appearing when a message is selected is annoying. Can't you provide means for hiding it if the user prefers? Older versions of Messages allowed multiple text deletions by providing circles that the user could click on to select multiple texts.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,DAPPER DAX Aka Sourpatch Kid (Sourpatch Kid),"""Chat"" is still an ongoing issue and still blocks certain people from messaging me when it's not working, which is most of the time. Says ""setting up, trying to verify number"" and ""connecting...."" 90% of the time. Every so often it will actually say ""connected"" and Work, but mostly Not. Do NOT send me that so-called self help link, I have already tried everything",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Melanie Jean-Louis,Really like the app & the chat features. The emoji kitchen is particularly fun to use. I appreciate the update for receiving reactions & reacting to iMessage texts it as well. The live messaging function is a nice touch for native android users. I hope that in the near future we can have those capabilities across networks and phone types such as having the option to video call to iMessage without an external app. As of 12/1: having issue managing my texts. Also searching through texts feature.,5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Punzel Pondering,"Horrible new app icon. Optical illusions are not universally accessible. The proportions and colors of the icon are not cognitively harmonious, and are a struggle for those with chronic headaches or migraine triggers. This is basic design and I expect better oversight from this brand. Worst of all, it cannot be hidden or removed from the home screens.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Patricia Mount,Why the sound/noise now. Why why why does this have sound attached to outgoing and incoming messages. I am NOT talking about the notification of being alerted to you have a message but that annoying sound you can't turn off that happens when you send a message and sound attached when someone replies during the conversation! Only way to stop that sound is completely turn off all sound associated with the app completely which means not receiving notification someone sent you a message.,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,philly sistah,Much to be desired. The group chat vs bulk feature is all our nothing. Not individualized like Textra. Further what is the point of setting up a group name and saving it if you have to do it every time you want to chat with that group?!? You can't just type the group name and start chatting. Tried it multiple times and the app will say invalid contact. Instead I have to search for an older chat with that group. I enjoy the ability to like messages and to view messages across devices.,3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Rachel Reyes,"Was working great up until yesterday. The search feature is crashing as soon as it is opened. Whether I try searching for a name to bring up previous messages or a word/phrase within a text conversation, the program crashes every time. I've tried clearing the cache and restarting the phone. Nothing is working. Both the operating system and the app itself are up to date on all software updates.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jessie Lyn Thompson,"This isn't a response to the app functionality, but the new icon design. I am not sure where else to provide this feedback because the listed support email is no longer monitored. The icon has an uncomfortable double vision effect that's very disorienting for me. On the help message boards, several people suggested it might particularly affect people with astigmatism, which I have. I was hoping to find an option to use the old icon, or at least one without the double blue layering effect?",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Katie Hutchison,"Have really enjoyed this app until the most recent update, this past month. It's giving me all sorts of problems now. Trouble sending and receiving messages, pictures, etc. All the time previous, it was awesome. I really liked its simplicity, and had no problems. Update: it may be a carrier issue - T-Mobile Android users seem to have similar problems with the app, according to the forum, and no acceptable answers.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Kakha Khmelidze,"This program is recommended by the manufacturer of the phone and it is correct. This is a high-end Google app and is more modern, but it has some noticeable flaw. I would very much like the application to show the SIM card number (in the case of a dual SIM phone) right in the list of SMS messages. It would be very convenient. And also will be great if you implement ability to delete messages right through notification panel. I almost forgot about swipe to delete! Please, kindly consider it too.",5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Juli & Nick Kellogg,"Generally I like it and really want to like it. But it has some bugs. For example, I cannot see any of my starred texts. When I search and click starred, nothing shows up. If I am in a contact and do the three dots and choose started, nothing. and in fact, that action also causes me to not see any messages from that person when I exit that screen. I have to exit the app completely and come back in to see the messages again. If this bug gets resolved, happy to give this a higher rating.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Daniel Schultz,"When the app works (most of the time) it is great. Love it, best option for messaging aside from apple. But in my experience, the app is prone to several bugs that make it impossible to receive notifications. You cannot contact Google directly, and all they say to do is troubleshoot, which is not helpful. The Develop Contact email isn't even in use anymore, so don't waste your time.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Nate D.,"This app has started to randomly just not show some messages that are sent to me. I can see the messages when viewing on the web in a browser, so I know I am technically receiving them, the app will just not show them every now and then. It doesn't happen often, but enough to be a big problem imo (this the primary function of a messaging app that fails sometimes...).",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Brittany “Blu” Lucas,"The app works fine for the most part. It serves its basic function of allowing me to text. However, lately it has been lagging a bit (particularly, I notice the lag when I am trying to mark a message as read using the drop-down notifications bar). Also, the search in conversation function often tells me that there are zero results for a particular word or phrase when I know for certain the phrase exists in my recent messages.

Something has changed recently that it causing problems. It's on the developer to fix.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Michael Markham,"I love this app, but it gets a two star rating because it has a major flaw. I recently, accidentally, deleted a message conversation. Conversation. It was a very important one that I referred to old messages on constantly. There is no trash folder in this app. When you delete something it is gone. The only way to get those messages back was to factory reset my phone and restore all of my messages from my cloud backup. Just put in a trash folder.",2

Also the text to speech is absolutely horrible, and it's not my phone it's the app.. It will put the same word in twice, add words and get the words completely wrong. No when I try to send a text and it doesn't go through, for some reason I have to hit it and then select option switch to SMS.. I am not very savvy with technology but it works half the time.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,T D,"Google Messages is always in your face. There are often pop-ups telling me about a new feature I will never use. When spam is detected, their warning takes up so much screen, I can't read the message to determine if it is actually spam. When I get a text, an unwanted preview pops up. I can't turn this feature off. This app has become so convoluted that it makes sending and receiving texts somewhat annoying.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jon Jay,I've been missing messages sent from iPhones. We've compared screenshots multiple times and I'm not recieving some of the messages. It says the message was sent but I haven't received them. Android to Android is always fine. I haven't had this issue in the past when I was using my pixel 2xl. Recently upgraded to a Pixel 6 so maybe the phone is the issue? It's just a strange thing to happen. Other than that I think this app is user friendly and definitely a solid default.,4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Christl McKee,"I don't know what the heck is going on but all of a sudden NONE of my text messages are going thru.

com.google.android.apps.messaging,Robert Shirley,"When you hit the search icon in the app, you used to be able to search your messages for specific words or phrases. Now, when you hit the icon, it brings you to a separate page where you can only search images, places, and links from that message chain which is a fairly useless search function. I want to be able to find a specific point in the conversation, like an address (doesn't show up under places cause it wasn't a complete address, just building number and street name)",2

Nothing has fixed it, aside from going to a different app, so I KNOW it's not the phone...",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Nathan L,It is a shame that Google doesn't implement Google translate into the application as an option to auto translate incoming and outgoing messages. It would save a great deal of time from switching between apps and copying and pasting messages. Would also allow for reviewing the intended messages if their was a translation issue without having to leave the messages application. I feel like this is a real missed opportunity!,3

I have zero use for this feature, yet every phone call I make start with the app saying ""getting ready for Real-Time Text"". I've looked in the settings in multiple versions of the app and do not see a way to turn it off. In 2021, there is no excuse to not having an option for turning off features.

The Google backup doesn't allow you to restore messages, only if it is to a new phone. Support said to use an external software. The Samsung message app allows you to restore deleted messages. The app is widely used but very limited. It's a small ask , but no response. What happened to the ability to like messages? Google message said NO to it's users. Why.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Richard James,"The app is great for the most part but I don't get why Go edition users get to have the Lite version of the messages app. I have a lot of messages and I'm unable to search on the Lite version so I had to install the main app. Nonetheless, I find it a major difficulty for the Chat feature to activate on default. It's a bit or miss. I usually have data and I want my chat feature to be activated immediately I have data. Not waiting for ""CONNECTING....."" Anyway, keep up the developments.",4

Second, it needs to be able to send bigger images file formats. Third, it needs to better work with iMessage users. Fourth, it needs a larger document sending feature. Finally, it needs a spam filter to block known spam numbers or texts. Otherwise, I really love the Messages app.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,MAJESTIC DETAIL,"My experience with messages after a few updates and a year later, had me change my mind. I don't like that I can't edit the categories and it doesn't add to them properly. The other issue is, swiping left or right to archive. Another function that is useless, I'd like to either delete one way and archive the other. There's many features I loved but it's the small ones that irritated me the most. I guess it's the simplicity of it all.",2

It started with messages randomly not coming through and has escalated to messages also but sending. I've tried every cache/storage clearing I can, restarted my phone countless times, and checked to make sure phone and app are the most recent updated versions. It'll work for a day and then get stuck on""Connecting"" again. Frustrating. Finally just turned it off. I miss the features (typing, read receipts) though.",1

I used that to connect with messages for web on my desktop. Second I can't seem to get a notification sound when I get a text and I've checked every setting imaginable. If I could get those issues worked out this would be a five-star app.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Trish Brennan,"Been using it for ages with no problem. I don't know if it's the app or Android 13, but I can't set the default notification sound now. It's set to ""none"" so all I get is the vibration. I can set individual contact notification sounds, just not the default. Help desk has not been able to help without having me delete all my messages. Which I won't do without knowing it will work as getting them back is both necessary and a pain",3

I can rarely send a message, I get messages in the wrong order, I constantly get messages to download images from my family only for it to not do anything, I never know if people see my messages, and it's sometimes days after that a message they sent instantly actually appears. If I could, I would give half star. The only thing preventing this app from being a zero is that when I can send messages, it's smoother than the app that came installed on my phone.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Edgar Diaz (AnimalPuff),"The biggest problem I have is a change that happened a while back. The colors for messages used to be more vivid and easier to read, but they became duller and that has made it harder to read for many people, including myself. Last night I uninstalled/reinstalled and it went back to vivid colors, until this morning when they went back to dull. If this is related to Material You (I'm on default theme) or another setting, let me know but that should be an optional setting anyway for this reason.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Adam Chittenden,New update is an un-improvement. A long press on the Return button sends the message?? Has a developer never pressed that button for longer than a millisecond on accident? The delete button is directly above and if you slide your thumb down at all while doing this you send out your partial message. What was the reasoning behind this? Awesome to send half written or half deleted messages out all the time. Keep up the great work.🙄,3

But, with the latest Android (12) update, I got a few weeks ago, I can no longer get group texts or see any messages/pics that my group sends.

It's obviously a bug that Google has to fix . Please fix this.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Ceres Azalia,"You can't sort which messages belong to the ""personal"" category, and which ones are ""business"" (and the app is really bad at guessing it). There is no way to access any type of ""settings"" menu. So I can't change the tone it uses when I get a message or any other settings, and I have looked all over the app and my phone to try to figure it out. A Google search shows there used to be three dots in the top right corner you could click on to access settings but that appears to have been removed.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,d0ekun,"App is getting worse. I'm sure most users have experienced that dreaded group text that won't stop. Once again, you've made it MORE difficult to mute individual conversations. First, from the conversations list, you could long-press a single conversation, then a menu would pop up allowing you to mute it with a simple tap. Then, it was opening the conversation, 3-dot, select ""notifications"", then ""silent"" - all to mute a single conversation. Now the option is buried even deeper w/in the app. WHY?",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Greg Brailsford,"Like most Google products these days, the app contains bugs that affect the most basic functionality. The notification sound sometimes plays correctly, and other times the app ignores it and plays the android default notification. Totally random as to which you get. Worse, actually trying to find where to change the notification sound is impossible without doing a Google search. Overall such a basic app that Google has tried to make as convoluted and buggy as possible.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Michael Waldkirch,"Decent. Does what you would want out of texting (usually). It gets the job done as long as you don't mind a few extra keystrokes; glitches frequently. Main glitch- When I begin a new message, or even open an old message, typed text disappears with the keyboard still in view. Also texting videos are worthless as carriers limit MMS so you're stuck with a blurry, tiny video. Would be five stars if these would be fixed.",3

Out of habit, when I'm typing and want to add emoji, I press and hold the enter key and swipe up and release, because that's how it's been for years, but now I've been sending unfinished texts to people if it's a text where I wanted to include an emoji in it. This is so annoying. Put things back the way they were before",2

So it's definitely an issue on your end and fix it right. Maybe you shouldn't have upgraded or changed things up in the chat and left it the way it used to be when it was working fine.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,cameron york,Whenever sending videos the file compresses so much to the point it's unviewable its so bad. You can't send any relatively long videos if you want to be ready for it to be compressed to the high heavens. Also between Apple and this awful not sure whose part it's on but Samsung allowing this to be their main service app for messaging is laughable it's almost as if they want you to download I different app,2

Over the last few years, I have tried this app on several occasions, each for a few weeks at a time. I tried it on my Note 8, then on my Note 10+ a few times, and now I've been using it for the last 5 weeks on my S22 Ultra. You'd think that the official messaging app for Android OS would work flawlessly on ANY high-end smartphone. Not the case. This app is just as buggy and laggy as ever. Fragmentation is bad. Lame, Google.",2

I should be able to ""like"" someone's message, just like iPhone users can like my message. If it's in chat mode, and you don't have 4glte, it will spin forever, until you turn off chst mode. sms mode sends just fine. Fix those things and it's easily a 5 star app.",2

I've turned on the feature that allows a text to auto-switch from MMS to SMS if it's not going through but that's no help. It used to be that a WiFi connection was sufficient for sending group texts or texts w/more data",1

Still no functionality to save all messages to SIM, no message scheduling, and no option to cancel messages. Good in a pinch and certainly better than the modern stock app though, which has also dropped said functionality. EDIT 2022: The previous review is still true. Now they have an account/sync option, but still no way to transfer conversations to external storage or the cloud. And the new logo is God awful. What has wrong with the original?",2

And when gives me option to send thru regular text goes thru right away. This app had more features than regular text, but it crashes a lot. I noticed that everytime It shows 'sending' I go in app store and there is an update. It's like you have to update the app every few weeks if not every week. Kinda annoying",2

com.google.android.apps.messaging,Matthew Graf,"RCS suddenly stopped working. First, only one of my friends wasn't working with RCS, and so I chose to reinstall the messaging app. Then, after the reinstall, chat features only works for about 1 minute before messages stop sending via RCS. Getting a ""Not sent, tap for options"" message and retrying the send doesn't work. If I turn off chat features, I get one more minute before it stops. Tried clearing cache and data as well as full uninstall/reinstalls of messages and carrier services.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Savanah Reynolds,Update! I was told to put in my feed back in the app and still nothing works!!!!! Now they've made it where the previous update doesn't work either!!!!!! Now I am not receiving or sending anything correctly. The app worked great until this update!!!! Now none of my messages will send out nor am I receiving them I keep uninstalling the update. But then it auto up dates over night and I'm stuck with the same issue!!!! Worse update!!!! I'm about to delete this messaging app all together.,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Brian Ricks,"New reactions stopped working. Buggy Update: reset the app removing data/cache, it ran through re-settingup the RCS, accepting terms, but still no go. Perhaps a Pixel bug, no idea. Second Update: Per your suggestion, I visited the URL and found this is a common issue - the messaging app has issues and basically the features simply do not work. Sad as this is an integrated part of the mobile phone.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Zachary Helgren,I actually really like this app and it's features all except the fact that it doesn't allow for sending high quality photos and or videos to people using an iPhone. It's hard to share photos and videos of my children with my wife since she has a iphone. They always come out super blurry and often unrecognizable. It's the major drawback of android software talking with apple software. But otherwise I love Messages.,4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,David Phillips,"I typically have a good experience with this way of messaging but lately I've had to resend all of my messages as sms. Every single one. I'll send a text and realize hours later that it never sent and.have to resend it as SMS. I've reinstalled, updated to latest versions, ensured it was my default messaging app, and restarted just about everything. Id really like to give a higher star review but I just can't until this is fixed.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,April Hammock,IDK what happened but now half the time my phone will only vibrate. There is no option in messages to change the tone/notification sound with a text message. There is no sound option for text like there is for the phone ringing. I appreciate the quick response but none of that helps me. My phone used to have an option right below changing my ringtone to change my text notifications and the option is no longer there.,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Charlie Vinz,"I switched away from this app years ago, when it became too buggy to be functional (messages would not send to frequent contacts, conversations would not load etc). I was pretty satisfied with Hangouts as an alternative, but I was unceremoniously kicked off that app this week. After 5 days of attempting to use this again, it is still just as dysfunctional, but in different ways. Certain contacts are unable to receive messages and vice versa, there is no syncing between phone and computer etc",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Cur Dee,"Edit: It's nothing to do on my end. I absolutely hate this app. It was forced upon me on my Galaxy S22. When I send text messages, it's like 50/50 whether it will send or not. It sticks on ""sending"" and I have to click on the message and change from ""chatting"" to click on sms/multimedia message or whatever it is. It changes from dark blue to light blue and doesn't tell me if message has been read or not. I can't stand this dang thing. I almost want to go back to my S20 5G to get rid of it.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Aura Alta,"Poor interface. For example: Icons take up too much space, drafting window is too small, messages do not appear in proper order. We changed only because of a mysterious bug causing incoming SMS messages to fail silently that no T-mobile tech could explain. This should be called RCS, not ""Messages."" The confusing name caused confusion with the previously existing app native to the Samsung phone. Not pleased.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,penny grant,Messages is pretty good. Very rarely stops working. UPDATE: for the past few months I have not received any texts when my cell is turned off. It has caused so much trouble. Three times TracFone has tried to help me. This last session I did receive two texts through Customer Service. I was excited thinking my Messages was working again. Nope. Do you have a link or suggestions thatcan solve this problem?? Thanks,4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Ashley Johnson,I had to get a new phone and now this app is not working properly. I'm a realtor and I have a separate app to share house listings with my client via text. Before I was able to do that but now it will not work. I have tried removing and downloading all of the apps about 3 times and still seeing the same results. I need for this to get fixed quickly.,2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,ann W-Fitz,There is no way to personalize. Cannot set font higher cannot change background color it is plain Jane Update You cannot simply take a picture then go to the messaging app to send..it's not right there. You have to hit folders then folders again! WHAT? Why isn't the picture I took most recently not available right there.. click on folders twice more???,2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Austin Schriver,"Fast, secure, and convenient. The three words I use to describe RCS and Google Messages, If you're debating switching from your Mobile network's default messages app, this is the one to run to. It never disappoints with quick media sending, response prediction, or even looking for keywords like ""Time"" and giving active suggestions from your calendar. It's made my Smart Phone feel a little more like a ""Smarter"" Phone.",5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Kim Sullivan,"It used to be fine, then one day the app icon changed and I could no longer receive vibrate notifications when a message came in. I cannot find anything on the phone or in the app to set vibrate. Now either I don't know when a message comes in, or it has to make noise and disturb everyone around me. Why would you change something in my phone without my permission to make it worse and cripple the functionality?",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jessica Koflan,"It texts fine, but lately I have been having an issue with sending and receiving messages. I'm constantly clearing the little bit of cashe that's in the app and cleaning my actual phone.

com.google.android.apps.messaging,BJ,"This is the best app I've used for texting! Not only is it more user friendly for those who like multimedia messaging but also like to have more manual control (fewer defaults that can't be turned off), this team behind the app actually listens to feed back and makes changes unlike most companies I've ever given feedback. This app and it's team are great! Good stuff!",5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Kate Kay,"For several weeks, I have been unable to receive photos and documents. This is used for a business, and for years the old app was wonderful!! Why did you change something that actually worked? Also, the new icon is ugly, and looks like a glob of paint has dropped on my screen. Please change EVERYTHING back to what worked. Lastly, why have stupid emojis started popping up in all of my texts,? I repeat... this phone is used for business. I do not appreciate the emojis popping up everywhere.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Krys Baxter-Ragsdale,"The app was great but something happened and suddenly the text prediction is horrible. Previously the app would suggest things similar to what I was trying to say and now what it suggests isn't even close to what I'm trying to say and I have to continue typing until the end of the word until the correct suggestion even pops up and by that time, there's no point selecting it when I've already typed the word.",2

But being reminded every 10-20 minutes that the devices are paired is painfully annoying. Why, why, why? Really need a way to turn off this notification without turning off incoming message notifications. The Messages app has many app notification settings but I've yet to find any explanations on what they do. This REALLY needs to be fixed.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Ben Perkins,I always loved this messaging app and it keeps getting better and better!! So incredible. I love the RCS features that make it possible to have more rich conversations with the people that I care about. The interface is gorgeous and fun and they're really pushing the boundaries of what's possible across the Android ecosystem. Super excited for what's coming next!,5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Meredith Hammond,Updated: would also love to have an option to get text from trash for at least 30 days like some other apps. Also to where we can get read receipts from someone that has theres turned on too but if there using a different message app. really want to like this message app but even with read receipts on. I still can't see that my hubby read my text. WE have the same phone and his is showing read on his end but will not. I have tried absolutely everything!,2

Current default font displayed in both apps are stoic!",4

com.google.android.apps.messaging,louis daher,This is probably one of the most useful apps that I use unfortunately the synching between browsers and the phone needs a bit of work. With some tweaking of that I would have given it a higher rating. As well as some work with some automatic features for the photos. It's both a productivity and enjoyment app necessary for modern day life,4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jeff Edge,My messages don't pop up on the lock screen since Galaxy updated the phones. All of my setting are correct. I have also shut my phone down and restarted it. It was working fine until yesterday after the update. I hear the notification but no pop up.

com.google.android.apps.messaging,Jacob Heiner,"I have one main complaint. But first, I really really love this app. I think Google has done incredible things and this almost competes with Apple's iMessage. However, my main issue is group messages. Whether on Android or not, group messages are a nightmare. Whenever anyone in the chat sends something, it sends it in a separate thread as a downloadable message. After I download it, it resends it into the group chat. That's so frustrating and I haven't figured out a way to fix that.",4

It does have someone who I have not talked to for over 2 years as a top contact. They really need to fix this so you can customize who your top contacts are. Follow up after several months. Still only three stars. There's also issues with groups. I have not been able to delete a contact within a group. The search on Google does not have the updated edit menu.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Logan Herrera,I've had this app for awhile and it's just been getting better and better as the years have gone by. They just updated it now to where you can see the little dots when someone is writing you in real time. It's also encrypted along with notifying when messages have been delivered or read.

Was literally almost the perfect app before then, now my chat messages hardly ever go through. And even though I have send sms automatically if chat doesn't go through. I still have to manually send it myself. It will tell me ""Chatting with such and such"" and message failed. Or one chat message would go through and then all the rest keep failing.

It CONSTANTLY checks to see if your phone is online, and even with the phone next to the tablet.... cant find the phone, so it loses connection and wont text. This app is a joke! Stock VZ MSG was better",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Logan Peever,"The app has some connectivity issues for me. Also it considers most incoming messages as spam without checking with me first. I assume that must be a setting though and I assume it isn't ""invasive"" so it doesn't check the message to see if it's spam or not. Also, personal opinion- the interface isn't too great.

I also hate that it won't let me text with emails when lots of my friends numbers are actually emails and we would like to make a chat with an email but can't because MY messages app isn't iMessage or if I make the chat we can't add my friend who uses an email. it's kind of disappointing.,1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Francisca Banuelos,"I like the app , I can send text and picture messages and receive them from any phone. The only problem is that I have and Android phone and when. Sending videos to someone with an iPhone.The quality is bad 😔 unable to send a good quality video . The person receiving it is unable to see images or hear the sound .",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Martin Topole,"Had no problems with this app until recently (I think update 11/16). Now that I get a text from a contact from whom I haven't received a text before, the app shows only the phone number and not the contact's name. Even when I save the contact from the app, it doesn't change. Tried clearing rhe cache but that didn't really help. What more can I do? Cheers!",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Georgeanna O'Rourke,***Update! Emailed a fix. It worked. Thank you. I take back what I said below. Lol.*** Average. For some reason. I can no longer click into the text notification have have it open into that particular message. It takes me to a black screen. I then have to press back and it takes me to all my messages. Super annoying and I don't know why it started doing this.,5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Tyler Urzada,"Until about 3 months ago this app was rock solid. But my phone began to destabilize. Dropping calls or not receiving calls, sms messages that wouldn't send without having to cycle airplane mode or clearing the cache multiple times a day. Between Messages and Android Auto issues, I'm almost fed up as a staunch Android supporter. The fixes are slow to update. Thumbs up for fixing Android Auto finally(I think), but I've given up on messages. Switched to Textra, no issues so far. Google, do better.",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Dusan Maksimovic,"You are trying to be all and in reality you are less. If user want to share pictures or file there are lot of options(mail,Viber, what's, Facebook messenger...) But when you are default text message app on my phone you should do that simple job without mistake. And that is not the case. Often, when people from my contact list send me message ,there is no indetification. Also when you use 2 sim cards , one of them don't send messages at once. There's about minute lag ,and that is terrible .",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,O G,"The app started to crash out of the blue. I have cleared the cache and the app data and it didn't help. The most annoying part is that I'm getting a popup for a fraction of a second about the crash every 2nd min or so. I had to install a 3rd party app to replace Messages for SMS and the 3rd party app does work. After advice which I received in response to the review, I have uninstalled and then installed it again. It started to work after the reinstall.",1

The option is blocked by a screen that has a caricature telling me to choose my default app, which I did 3 times without a change and now it won't let me get past that screen. So I can't view or respond to my text messages. I've restarted the phone twice and looked at my settings and nothing helps.",1

Kindly fix the bugs, thank you",1

Chats enabled, status connected but go to send a message and it doesn't send no matter how many times I click retry (on wifi or mobile data). It also doesn't automatically switch to send as text, although I have this option enabled as well. Very annoyed!",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Athina Kefalopoulou,"Mostly works fine and smoothly. Since a recent update, though, when saving a new contact to my contacts list, when those same numbers message me their contact name doesn't show up in the app; only the phone number is shown. Same thing when messaging a new number from my end, and then saving the contact in my list after the fact. Have rebooted device, shut off/turned on, and re-saved the same number(s) multiple times. This is on Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro. Thanks",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Ken Rosie,"I keep getting the message ""Not sent, tap to try again"". This has only started happening in the last few days. It sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't. It happens on numbers that have been fine before. I have tried everything recommended in Google's help list. I have reinstalled the app. I have deleted the problematical contacts. I am not low on space. There is no problem with my SIM card. I don't know what else to do other than change to a non-Google app (which I don't want to do).",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Konstantine Tzirtziris,"It is not rendering the contacts (from Google). You refresh, restart, switch off and back on... nothing! It just shows the number without a name!! After updating a couple of contacts ie adding a last name, it still shows the first name only or the way it used to be before. Yep, internet connection etc. is good, other messaging apps get it right!!",3

I tried going back to the old icon but it says it needs to be default for messages to work. The new setup seems awful. I wish designers would consult with disabled people on user ability. Life is hard enough, but this takes away a lifeline to be able to recieve support (through messaging).",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Dominic Clayton,"RCS is completely useless. Can never be sure if it's connected and working or not. I've been missing so many messages lately and have been unable to send any. In settings it will just say ""Connecting"". Clearing the cache only works for a short time. I've decided enough is enough and have disabled Chat Features once and for all, and asked my contacts to message me on other apps. It's pathetic that Google can't even make simple messaging work reliably.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Mary Contrary,"It's functional, but I wish you could set text tones to be different than the general notification tone, and it'd be nice if you could personalize text tones to contacts too. I use this phone for work and personal purposes, and it would be useful if I cpuld more easily differentiate who was trying to contact me",2
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Matthew Cruice,"Mostly works really well with 2 issues. It randomly turns some conversations into ""chats"" which means your message doesn't get delivered if you close the app too soon and it doesn't alert you. The other big issue is there is no way to reply only to the sender of a group message; it will always reply to all the recipients too which is bizarre and causes a lot of confusion.",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Sheilah Thail,"I updated it two days ago and chat features have failed to turn on. They were saying connected at first but still couldn't send a message, though I could receive messages via chats. Now it's stuck at verifying number and it really sucks for the past 18 hours and I have tried to clear the cache and everything but doesn't work! I hate it!!!!! I liked it better when it wasn't updated!",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Sri B,"The recent update changed the image of the app, and it's causing dizziness to me. The new image(with white background, and blue call-out) looks like two call-out images superimposed on each other. Images appear this way when you have short sight, and right now it's causing me to believe that my sight has increased. Revert to the old image, or remove the superimposition. Also, when everybody is moving to dark mode, I don't know why you chose the opposite for the app image; change to dark mode.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,David Acero,"Nothing bad to say about it. I really like how spam and suspicious messages are automatically placed in a different folder and you can choose to ""block"" and ""report spam"". If you need to send pictures and video you need to be connected to phone data, wifi doesn't work... That's unfortunate but what can you do. You can also search words in conversations and that's really convenient. Would recommend.",5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Peter Gallacher,"Messages is great. Being able to pair with another device like a PC or laptop, and send/receive messages from there is convenient. Built in RCS support works well and is pretty automated these days. I like the way sending attachments and videos is seemlesly slotted in where the keyboard would normally go. One thing I'd like to see is the addition of a toggle to go back to RCS mode after sending an SMS to someone. Right now. If you choose to send an SMS, it stays like that for a while.",5
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Diane Sprung,"Many many issues with app stability and chat in the past 10 days or so. Not impressed! Phone has frozen, had to do a hard restart on more than one occassion. Have deleted the app then did the update. I hope it works properly now. If not I will have to look for another app which is sad as it worked perfectly before the beginning of this year. UPDATE: working great now!",4
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Agent Lu,"Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Stuck on sending for a couple of hours, There should be a configurable time limit for chat to be considered as undelivered and be re sent as an SMS right away automatically. I set this as the default messaging app for my entire family, everyone has data, everyone has access to WiFi, everyone has SMS credits and yet somehow, chat gets stuck on ""sending"" and when they do get an error, it doesn't automatically re send as an SMS. It's been an inconvenience.",3

If I have 2 people I want to text, I can't go to a thread with one of them and add a new recipient and then text them both. Nope... have to start completely from scratch.

The texting app may be the biggest single reason I give up this phone.",1
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Tim Blundell,"As far as SMS messaging Apps go it's one of the best. Far more feature rich than it needs to be, in fairness. But, I can't understand why Google continue to develop it, when everyone else in the world apart from North America has moved on from SMS. The RCS implementation is patchy and when messages fail you often aren't notified for a good while after. And the new logo makes it look like you've got double vision - whoever cleared that needs firing!",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Carmine “MusicaDeItalia” Corrado,"It's nice to have Read/delivered and incrpicted messaging but the app lacks really basic things. It's annoying thst you can't change colors of conversations or get them to match a theme that you have downloaded from the galaxy store. The apps function of ""send as sms"" if sending by chat fails never works it just doesn't send at all until you manually select it to send via sms even with the toggle on to switch to SMS. I'd really like to be able to have different colors per conversation.",3
com.google.android.apps.messaging,Millwall Dude,Since the last update the messaging app has gone awry. Sometimes your message will send and sometimes not. Old messages won't delete after being read. Whatever you have done in this update please undo it. The old message system is still there and I think I will go back to it and see if it will work again.

Not sure why it is hard to send a verification txt message to the SIM number and get the chat features active. Also, if chat is enabled, the automatic sending as SMS does not seem to work. If the recipient is offline, the message just sits there waiting for another confirmation for sending as SMS. So if you don't go back and manually confirm, the message is not sent.",2

Now when a message can't be sent it doesn't automatically try to send it as an SMS and you have to do it manually. Problem is, when you do this, it doesn't change back to 'chat' and there's no way of reverting back. Also, not keen on the new icon. My mum is 72 and has difficulty in recognising certain apps and was used to the old icon. Now it's changed its a bit of a problem for her. Otherwise, it's a great tool that has a lot of brilliant features.",3

I tried to send an sms to get back together with the other group and the message failed to deliver. It also took a very long time to receive the failure notification.

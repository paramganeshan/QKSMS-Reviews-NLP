com.whatsapp,Karen B,"I'd give more than 2 stars if I could reach someone to resolve issue. Whenever I attempt to attach photos/video from gallery, it wont allow me to select them. Of course, I also have to select Gallery from the 3 buttons on the right, but regardless, I cannot select and send. This is very frustrating as I use this for work and used to be able to do this with captions for each pic. Now I have to attach, write caption, send and do it again (from another app!)",2
com.whatsapp,Hilmy B,"Was good. But the latest update doesn't allow you to select multiple pictures to send, you have to send one at a time. It now also requires multiple steps to get to your album just to be able to share pics. So you have to go through multiple steps to get to your gallery (which wasn't intuitive after years of using it) and you can only select 1 pic at a time.....",1
com.whatsapp,RAF Strayhorn,"It's a good app and it does the job but changing from one phone to another is a total nightmare and nobody seems to be able to explain how to do it. The web instructions are confusing and wrong, the independent websites are confusing and wrong, and I just want to transfer everything, including chats, from an old phone and number to a new phone and number. I feel like it would be easier to build a faster than light spaceship and I also feel like it's a lot harder than it absolutely has to be",3
com.whatsapp,Rick C,"Been using whatsapp on my main chromebook flawlessly for about a year. Very few issues. A week or so ago, it started to crash about 90 seconds into my video chats. I would start it up again, and it would inevitably crash again. I would say out of 10 conversations, 9 would crash after about 1 and 1/2 to 2 minutes in. Very ponderous and frustrating. Switched the whatsapp app to another chromebook, same issues. Cleared storage, reinstalled, same. Will switch to another app that actually works.",2
com.whatsapp,alyssa vair,"Edited to include: I can't get notifications that I have messages . It literally pops up and says ""Popup notifications are no longer available in your version of Android"" Really?? What is going on with this app, does the app need an update to keep up with the new phones?? I have a Galaxy S22. Used to be a great app but I suddenly can't watch or send videos and their customer service sucks. I've cecked all my settings and they seem fine.... 🤯😖",2
com.whatsapp,Blaine C,Can't give this app more than a 3. It's definitely meant for transitory experiences and not keeping things longer term. You can export but not import chat histories. Restore from local database doesn't work. No way to keep messages if you somehow end up with them on multiple phones from say using a new number without merging accounts immediately. Sad situation for ppl who like memories. I would recommend Telegram or some other messaging app,3
com.whatsapp,Matt D,"Dog water app. Frustrating UI. Cannot properly sync contacts with phone contact list. Cannot verify account via email--phone only, which is very inconvenient. Each picture must be downloaded to the phone, taking internal space. Cannot log in on multiple devices as advertised. Calling is unreliable on WiFi and data. But hey, this is Meta, not sure why I expected a quality product.",1
com.whatsapp,Sophia de Gastelum,"WhatsApp has been amazing for me since I began using it in 2019. I've never had an issue with it....until last night. I can no longer send or receive messages. I went to the Help and Troubleshooting, I've done the suggestions ...still can't send or receive messages. I've checked for updates as well, my app is up to date. Is there a different suggestion or a fix for this issue? Thanks",5
com.whatsapp,jordan morris,"I have an issue with the call features. Every time im in a call, the screen needs to be on and the app needs to be open or the microphone wont work. I can hear the person im talking sometimes, but they cant hear me if I multi-task/open another app. If I put the phone screen to sleep, it cuts out. I have had this issue since the beginning of the year. Idk what I could be doing but that is the only issue. But its a big issue for be because I call alot.",1
com.whatsapp,Gil Cohen,"Used to be great, not anymore. WhatsApp does not recognize phone's media after the latest Android upgrade. This creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files. In addition, phone calls disconnect after a few minutes blaming the phone's microphone. And on top of that, their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time. So slow and useless. Such a big disappointment!",1
com.whatsapp,Edward Hammock,"Image attachments have stopped working. You can no longer type a message and insert an image. It has to be two separate messages. It also opens up a different gallery view to the normal one, meaning that you can only see the images already in what's app. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it is still not working. Please can this be resolved ASAP.",1
com.whatsapp,Yiliu Siow,"A couple of issues: 1. When selecting photos to be sent, it no longer shows the phone's gallery folders by default. Very inconvenient to have to access it through the 3 dots on top left hand corner. 2. Unable to select multiple photos to be sent at once. Extremely inconvenient. Please look into it and fix them. Thanks",2
com.whatsapp,Elnaz Moein,Since the last update the app doesn't allow you to send multiple pictures. You have to send them one by one which is frustrating and on top of that you no longer have access to your camera gallery. You have to go through multiple stupid annoying steps to try and find the pictures from your camera to send 1 by 1. This app has changed for the worst. It is now useless and garbage. So disappointing,1
com.whatsapp,Humarno Schoonwinkel,"Since the last update, the chat don't organize according to the date of messages. If one is to delete sone messages in a chat then the date of the last message is what it gets organized by. Since the update, the messages are organized since the last time there's been communication with that individual, even if you delete some un-important messages the chat doesn't get reorganized. Please fix this. The previous way helped a lot or at least give us the option to choose. Thank you for listening.",3
com.whatsapp,Diederick Muller,"i love this app, it's very reliable in my opinion, and it has good quality. I don't know what I'd do without it. I just wish there would be more features with the status viewing, where you can make different groups of people who can view your status, and also that you can see who viewed your status when your read receipts are off. I do however dislike the fact that we can't screenshot 1 view photos anymore.",3
com.whatsapp,Bilal Khan,"hi head WhatsApp is a very high and an easy means of communication. Through WhatsApp, people from all over the world are very close to each other, but sometimes there is a problem that is the problem of speaking the language, because one country is different from another country. I don't understand the language easily, there are many countries in it that the language is very strange, such as China, Japan, Indonesia, etc. Sir, I suggest you to use all language voice translator, call translator an",4
com.whatsapp,Ben,"As someone has already mentioned, the latest update has messed around with the gallery whilst sending photos. Yes, you can click the 3 dots in top right and find the main selection of photos but you cannot select more than one at a time now and making it a timely process. Seriously needs to go back to how it was. Please fix!",1
com.whatsapp,Robin Deacon,"Something has gone very wrong in the last update. When attaching photos, the Camera album is no longer accessible (only albums showing images from WhatsApp chats are visible, which is basically pointless). The workaround is to click the three dots, select 'gallery' and then choose 'camera'. This workaround only lets you select one image at a time though, and no video files are shown either! It's a complete pain. WhatsApp Devs, ease un-break this feature!",2
com.whatsapp,Malaz YI,"On Xiaomi mi A3, the app has 2 major problems: 1. Voice notes get sent empty after some random amount of time, force stopping the app and restarting usually solve, but it's super annoying, you be talking for minutes and boom the voice memo is silent! 2. When scrolling up in the chat, the chat glitches for a split of second and scolls itself up way higher than you'd expect it. Like I just wanted to see messages from yesterday, but suddenly I'm at the messages from 3 days ago!!!",1
com.whatsapp,Graeme Francis,"Ever since the last android update on my Samsung gs21, voice and video calls have issues with the sound breaking up. Occasionally it drops the call completely complaining about a microphone fault. There is nothing wrong with the mic. I've cleared the cache but that made no difference. App is currently unusable for calls which is totally infuriating!",2
com.whatsapp,LoW,"Recent update: an update. POP UP NOTIFICATIONS NOT AVAILABLE - I haven't been able to receive notifications on my phone unless I open the app, I am no longer able to turn this feature on at all. Help! Also, when I try to connect to bluetooth devices, my phone is connect to the bluetooth but whatsapp doesn't recognize this and remains on the normal/loud speaker.",3
com.whatsapp,Oxid Media,"used to be very reliable but since FB/Meta took over it's a buggy mess version upon version. lately I have lots of problems with audio clips. they're sometimes completely silent, and after sending one the whole thing bugs out and no further clips are sent. you're just there talking to yourself the whole time. furthermore opening the camera for in-chat pics or status updates locks the phone up until the app crashes. we don't need more features, we need the current feature set fail and foolproof",3
com.whatsapp,Lutfi Ice,"A simple and lightweight chat app. You can send images with reduced size or original size as you like, and almost any file with ease. The main concerns are: 1. Somehow I can't reply any status at all with newer versions. The reply box and enter button isn't shown by swiping up, is it a bug on tablet devices? 2. Please increase maximum pinned chats/groups. 3 is not enough. 3. Somehow there are random business accounts those chatted me for unknown reasons and unrelated to me. Is it a bot spam?",3
com.whatsapp,Ravshan Khudoyberdiev,"It is a terrible app. When you will have to switch from Android to iOS or vice verca you will understand what I mean. It will be impossible to move chats across and you will have to pay $30 to some weird software for this. Telegram doesn't have such problem since it is cloud based. Secondly, they limit account to 1 device when I have 4 phones that I use all the time. On Telegram you can add as many devices as you want.",1
com.whatsapp,David Raju,"I had a very good experience of using this application, and it's so useful for the person to have a conversation with the person who is far from us. just one suggestion you must add up the music in the story uploading so the people who wants to add music with photo or a video can be possible eaasily. Must do this change and update it soon, people will so happy to use it. Thank you very much.As a user of whatsapp , I have seen one of the new features I.e. poll selection. This feature is not so us",5
com.whatsapp,Penelope Sampson,"Nice app but unfortunately when I reinstalled the app due to a problem it was having, all the photos downloaded from WhatsApp to my phone gallery were erased, over 2000 photos and memories lost. I didnt have it backed up but I thought if photos were saved to my phone that meant they were saved. Apparently WhatsApp has the ability to erase photos from your phones photo gallery. This seems like a massive oversight in the way the app works, it should only be able to add photos to your phone.",1
com.whatsapp,G O C,"Update: Media Permissions had been revoked by Android 13 update. Working fine again. Lately, it's just unusable. Can't send videos or share anything as easily as I could. The Gallery only shows media I received, unless I go to a sub menu, which only displays photos. No videos. The main reason I use this app for.",5
com.whatsapp,Elizabeth Galary,"Before the update WhatsApp was amazing. Now, when I go to send pictures I can't. It only shows the pictures that I received from other WhatsApp chats. I then discovered that if I touch the 3 dots on the top right corner I can open my gallery, but I can only send one picture at a time and all of my videos are missing. I have to go to my gallery app to select a video and send it one at a time. PLEASE FIX!",2
com.whatsapp,sahil khan,"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in the last decade. All in one, from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way, WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in the near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing.",5
com.whatsapp,LoL XD,"Latest update wasn't good, the app does not recognize phone's media and instead only shows its own (which is useless when it comes to send recent pictures from phone's camera). Also because it needs several steps now just to send a recent picture/image from phone's gallery, it can only send one at a time, which is tiring as hell, and finally, it can't send videos from the phone's gallery, since the app only recognize pictures. Fix this garbage. This update is really inconvenient and pointless.",1
com.whatsapp,Juan Manuel Diana,"The worst messaging app. Lots of bugs, notifications arrive late, the chat backup works terrible and there seems not to be any intention to improve it, the audio quality when recording a voice message is quite inferior compared to other messaging apps... I don't understand why you don't solve all these problems that have been in the app for YEARS. Not even a thing is good in this app. DISASTER.",1
com.whatsapp,Hamza Khan,"Used to be great, not anymore WhatsApp does not recognize phone's media after the latest Android upgrade This creates a major inconvenience when it comes to sending files. In pddition, phone calls disconnect after few minutes blaming the phone's microphone. And on top of that, their customer support is the worst i have seen in a long time. So slow and useless Such a big disappointment!",1
com.whatsapp,Владимир Федоров,"1) Constant backup issues. Now I have to use two copies of the app. 2) The app for Mac wants to update but it doesn't for some reason. And doesn't open either, so I use a web version instead. 3) Can't make a voice call quiet enough—even in the quietest mode it's too loud so that people in the same car can hear everything. There is no issue with that in other messengers. 4) And of course timeless classics—no way to use it on the laptop unless your phone has an active Internet connection.",1
com.whatsapp,Francois Fourie,"The latest update in Whatsapp is HORRIBLE! The whole gallery is meased up. Only certain images/videos pop up in ""recent files"" when you either want to send an image/video or upload a status. You cannot select multiple images to upload into status from gallery, so using your status update to market goods is taking way more time than usual. I am dissapointed and frustrated. This is NOT a functional update, it does NOT increase user experience in a good way!",1
com.whatsapp,Mohmd Rishal K,"Major issue faced is, after the recent update video calls automattically stops while talking. Especially while connected to a bluetooth device. It shows the ""microphone have issue please restart your phone"" but after that also the same problem is detected. It's very difficult to face a problem like these, from this application. And it's very uncomfortable for me to deal with these kind of BUG. Hope these problems will be solved.",3
com.whatsapp,Abha Kulkarni,"Keeps getting WORSE. I cannot view one-time photos, even though my Whatsapp is fully up-to-date. Even my system OS is up-to-date. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling WhatsApp to fix it but it ended up creating more problems - the ""Restoring Media"" has been stuck at 4% and it is doing absolutely nothing. WhatsApp developers - please help me and FIX all the bugs.",1
com.whatsapp,Gill K,"Like others have mentioned, ever since the latest Samsung update, I can no longer attach a photo from my camera gallery to a WhatsApp message, I can only access media that I've been sent on WhatsApp. My work around has been to attach a document and go to images, but the photo attaches as a jpeg - not ideal as I can not see the image of what I have sent. Please fix this WhatsApp!!",1
com.whatsapp,Shiny Luxray,"I really love this app! I use it to text all of my friends, and it makes it easier to identify that I have their correct number (because of the profile picture). Although, the call quality is really poor. Also, on video calls, I would like it to show nothing when I turn my camera off, instead of just a blurry screen. Maybe you could show it as a blank background with my pfp/profile picture on it? What I meant by poor quality is that I can barely hear my friends. The audio becomes glitchy.",3
com.whatsapp,Mumtaz Wali,"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use!",5
com.whatsapp,Daniel South,"Overall the best messaging app I've ever used, it's easy to use, free and uses WiFi to message, when connected. But I'd like it if you could make it so that if you call someone but they don't answer/decline they could leave a reason why they didn't answer/decline, and you could leave a reason why you called and vice versa. I'd also like it if you could make status videos longer, so like 1 min/1 min 30 sec instead of 30 sec. And you can send any type of video and it won't just say can't send. Thx",5
com.whatsapp,M Z,"Good messaging app. The fact that you can choose more than around five reactions is pretty great. What's still missing is the possibility to add more than one profile pic, which would be amazing since, the way I see it, it's usually not easy to abandon an image you've had for, let's say, months. Even a maximum of 5 would be enough. Apart from that, keep it up.",5
com.whatsapp,Amanda Coughlan,"I used to be able to send voice notes but now I cant. I can receive them and listen to them. When I press and hold the mic it just says recorder can not be set up right now try again later. This has been going on for over a year and no one has fixed it and say that it is a phone issue which it is not because voice recording works in every other app (Instagram, Snapchat etc) all permissions are granted, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times and cleared the cache. Very frustrating",1
com.whatsapp,mikhaela tiara,"I have a problem when I was calling through video calls. It's happening ti now since the recent updates. The problem is when I was on the video calls and then my camera is turned off accidently or not, the screen is turned on profile pictures (PP) instead of just a blurry screen like before. Honestly, if it's compared, I like more the previous ones than these recent updates. Please to whatsapp's team to FIX this. Because it's so annoying thing for me as a one of daily user of video call. Thanks",2
com.whatsapp,Jola Potentas,"It was great until I lost all my chats.. The app crashed 5 times in 4 months, each time it was struggling to restore backups and it would show no chat history. The last 3 times I somehow managed to restore it by, ironically, skipping the restore option.. I would lose a few days/weeks of messages. This time I've been trying for 2 weeks in different ways, following tips from others users experiencing the same issues, but it's not restoring the chats. I'm very disappointed and frustrated. Any tips?",1
com.whatsapp,Jen Shaw,"Been using for years. I've just got a new phone and can't have pop-up notifications on my lock screen - this is seemingly unavailable for Android 10 and newer, which is crazy! Why would it go backwards with a newer version? It's a real flaw, especially as my notifications are always on silent and I usually just glance at my lock screen to check. Everything else still has pop-ups so WhatsApp is the only one - come on IT folk, get your act together! Pretty please.... 😉",4
com.whatsapp,Andrea Gyopár Nagy,What on earth is going on with this app? It worked perfect until the last update. Now when I'm trying to attach a photo from my phone it's only showing the photos between me and that specific contact. If I want to attach a video it wont even appear at all. If I want to attach multiple photos I actually have to go into my photos app and share from there to WhatsApp. Like it's completely the opposite of user friendly right now.,1
com.whatsapp,Kay Zarei,"All videos send without audio constantly since android update. New update so far has been awful, please fix bugs. Deleting last message doesn't move contact down the list they stay right at the top, also harder to access gallery photos and only able to send 1 at a time. Quality has dropped quite a lot. Notifications have also reset somehow.",1
com.whatsapp,Helder Diego Câmara,"I was forced to update the app to latest version. That's bad. Frequent crashes when using it with wireless earbuds during the call. The main problem is for sure we can't listen to de Voice notes in private way, I don't wanna listen to my audios through the speaker! Added to this, keeps the screen on causing accidently touches. Summary: used to be really good, currently is very poor.",1
com.whatsapp,Pie Face,Would be good if you could add location to pics/videos shared on Status. And have Live video sharing on Status. Also Why does it have to have 'contacts to invite' under your list of contacts. Very annoying if you want to quickly scroll to the end of your contacts to now have all these random numbers that you would never invite. Some are just short codes listed not even proper numbers. Very annoying and messy looking,3
com.whatsapp,Gail Dear,"Like a few people have mentioned, since the last update, I am not able to attach photos from within WhatsApp. I have to come out of WhatsApp and go to my photo gallery and attach photos from there. Which is really annoying and time consuming. It was much easier before. Can this feature be restored please.",3
com.whatsapp,Joshua Okoro,"After the most recent update, every time the app is not visibly open on my phone, notifications would not come in until I open the app and everything shows up, I've checked background data settings on my phone and everything is intact, this has happened to me twice and always after an update. I really hope this could be fixed immediately. It's very disturbing.",2
com.whatsapp,Philip Ade,"As much as I like the app, since I was forced to update few days ago, it's been the worst app ever as i no longer get notifications for messages. Even when calls come in i only hear it ring so i have to open the app to see who is calling and also be able to pick the call. This is crazy at this point. Please fix this quickly it's no longer funny at all. Thanks",2
com.whatsapp,Jay-Dee Hermanus,Samsung S20FE Please fix the notification glitch. They either show and don't go away after reading messages/backup is complete or they don't show at all. Messages/calls also don't come through/deliver when I'm not in the app (even on WIFI). I've missed some time sensitive communications due to this. PLEASE FIX Phone is set to show all notifications.,1
com.whatsapp,Aster Dcosta,"The app was working fine until the recent update. When you call a person via Bluetooth headset, it connects your call to the receiver. But the receiver can't hear your voice. But can hear you when then receiver calls you themselves. Also the quick message notification feature doesn't deliver texts properly, with the sender not receiving the texts unless one opens the app. Please fix this issue as I think it is related due to some bug.",2
com.whatsapp,Olubiyi Oyetola,The issue I have is the notification. There is no more pop up messages anymore. It makes me loose so much messages to read and replied on time. Even calls don't appear again except through sound which I have to go to the app before seeing the call. This really affecting. Pls fix! Especially the pop up.,1
com.whatsapp,Muhammad Zubair,"This is OnePlus phone. On WhatsApp only, the sensors don't work right. I cannot listen to a voice note with my phone at my ear because sometimes it will switch to ear and at other times not. Similarly, it will not switch back from ear and it becomes impossible to switch back from ear before the voice note/call ends (the screen stays off meanwhile).",1
com.whatsapp,Nidhin Suresh,"IMPORTANT PROBLEM TO FIX:- The App was fine until the recent update. After that, while doing a video call especially via Bluetooth headset, the call is getting disconnected automatically. The mic and audio during the call also gets canceled at sometimes. It's been a real headache, since i was regularly using whatsapp video calls. A lot of people are facing this same problem after the recent update. Please fix this glitch in the next update and provide it as soon as possible. FIX IT SOON. IMP‼",1
com.whatsapp,Thaomy Nguyen,"I (and others, clearly) have experienced troubles with attaching media from my gallery since last update: it does not recognize my own media and doesn't show it as a option when I try to select. Instead I need to take a detour ( ... option upper right corner) and even then I can only select 1 file at the time. It's a huge hassle",2
com.whatsapp,Vincent Zothankima,"Two missing stars bcoz of 2 cons. 1. No customizable timer in ""Disappearing message"". At least add ""3 days"", please. 2. It would be nice to be able to turn off/pause the app's access to net quickly and easily, and without having to tinker with phone's settings. I don't even know if i can block net access in phone's setting. One would need too many tappings anyhow. Everything else is good..",3
com.whatsapp,Rashawn Diallo,"Won't allow me to send messages to existing contacts anymore on the 2nd installed version on my Samsung phones. I can't find anyone on the 2nd app unless I unistall, delete data, reinstall and re-verify numbers again, switching back and forth. The primary app reads contacts. The 2nd one won't. Terrible if you use multiple numbers like me.",1
com.whatsapp,Bint E Zehra,It is a great place to use chat services. However I'm a bit annoyed with its privacy features. I don't want any random contact outside my contact list to message and call me but I don't have that settings. It becomes annoying to receive calls and messages on Whatsapp from random contacts. I hope there's a way to block this unnecessary traffic. Also I cannot report suspicious numbers.,1
com.whatsapp,Scarlett Messenger,"What a miserable user experience. I can no longer attach more than one image from my gallery, it can't find most of the images on my phone for some reason, the backup function stopped working months ago, and good luck finding answers or getting support. Another helpful product ruined by greed and laziness.",1
com.whatsapp,Jasmine Clarke,"Why only a 3 star rating, when it is one of the dominant messaging apps? Because it isn't secure, irrespective of the end to end encryption it claims to employ. It is great that only admins can see certain changes, but admins should decide if a group needs disappearing messages or not. Indeed, it should not be possible for a hacker to take over another person's account !! I have received messages from people who didn't send them, many times...this is an identity issue and needs to be fixed ASAP",3
com.whatsapp,KULSHUMA HAQUE,"Over the last few months, this app has been the worst! It's so annoying, because I would use this app as my main source of communication with others. However, recently my messages just stop sending and video/voice calls are bad quality. The app doesn't work and it looks like it's because of network issues, but it's only that app that stops working!",1
com.whatsapp,Emma Ryan,Recently annoying. Every day for last 4 days it's constantly trying to backup and failing at 98%. I've tried turning backup off and it's still attempting it. I've restarted my phone. I've deleted some chats to reduce what it has to backup. Nothing works. There's plenty of storage space. I've just tried uninstalling and downloading the app again. Let's see if that works....... it didn't........,2
com.whatsapp,Paul Pociask,"It's great app in general. It worked perfect until the last update. Now when l'm trying to attach a photo from my phone it`s only shows the WhatsApp photos, won't show camera gallery photos or screenshots . Now to attach multiple photos I actually have to go into my photos app and share to WhatsApp. Update, Fixed - Ther reason for not being able to send pictures from the camera folder is because update removed permissions for ""photos videos"" just go to app settings and add permission.",3
com.whatsapp,Carline Askew,"WhatsApp backup and restore option is trash. I spent days backing up my information such as chats, pictures and etc, on my old phone, to be able to restore on my new phone. Even though, it appears to back it up, it did not. I've worked so hard and was extremely patient still nothing after multiple attempts, I gave up. This app is a fraud. Backup and restore data should be one of the top priority for WhatsApp.",1
com.whatsapp,Sushil Chavan,"A lot of important work remains to be done. Like view delete messages, hide personal messages, lock personal messages, put gift cover page on top of messages (like Instagram). Edit option, The world is moving a lot, man, a lot of changes should be made today. I agree the app is good. But how to hold on to the same thing for a long time. Change is human development. Live not ahead but at least live with. I think messages can be sent from anywhere. So I didn't like this app very much.",1
com.whatsapp,Coconut Palm,"Can't screenshot 'view once' media anymore. This is really silly as my friends use 'view once' to send things without using storage on our devices (since WhatsApps saves everything locally) so if the receiver wants to save it, they just screenshot it. How about just giving the sender a warning that it was screenshotted?? Big tech needs to stop forcing us to do what THEY think is right for US. If you send things online then assume that they'll be saved (take responsibility for your actions!)",1
com.whatsapp,Naomi Maxwell,"I was having the same issue when attaching photos to send. I fixed this by going into phone settings, apps, WhatsApp and changing permissions. Photos and videos was in the 'not allowed' permissions. Change this to 'allowed' and it should fix the issue. I had to allow audio and music when i did this.",2
com.whatsapp,Alessandria L,"Sending photo function is totally fussy! Nowadays click on the camera icon to select photos will only show the photos that already been sent in WhatsApp but not the ones in any other folders in the gallery, esp the latest pics! Plus, been directing to the gallery which show the camera folder, it will only allow you to send one photo even though you choose to add photo, the last added photo is the only one you can send, totally nuisance! What happen to the setting here!",3
com.whatsapp,Amit Lodhia,"Support is poor. After I upgraded my phone to Android 13, WhatsApp has an issue with video calls where the sound cuts out for me and the recipient. When I end the call and close WhatsApp, the microphone indicator shows that WhatsApp is still using the microphone and I have to specifically disable the microphone to stop it. I tried uninstalling the app, and reinstalling. Still happens. I wiped the partition cache of my phone. Still happens. I have contacted WhatsApp support, no help so far!",1
com.whatsapp,majula Deesthree,"Wow this app is the best thing that a person could have but there is this one issue that I think happens to other people but I'm not sure but anyways like we all love voice messages right? So when I try to use it and when I send it for some reason the voice message shows 1 sec and when u tap on it, it doesn't work and it won't say anything about what I said but please fix this issue because if I wanna type a long message but then I don't wanna type so I can use voice message so please fix this😭",3
com.whatsapp,mel bsk,"Been using WhatsApp for years now, and it's my first time facing any inconvenience at all. I don't get notified for my calls because it is “silenced by Do Not Disturb”. I don't recall turning such a thing on, and I tried everything to solve this but failed even though the app has permission for calls and notification. This is really frustrating, so it would be great if someone can tell me how to fix this. Thank you.",2
com.whatsapp,Queen Ashfaidhy,"After the most recent update, every time the app is not visibly open on my phone, notifications would not come in until I open the app and everything shows up I've checked background data settings on my phone and everything is intact, this has happened to me twice and always after an update. I really hope this could be fixed immediately. It's very disturbing",3
com.whatsapp,Yuki Desouza,"This app wouldn't be so bad if it didn't insist on taking over every aspect of your phone. I linked my contacts for one minute and now my contacts' photos won't show up, even after I've unlinked them. Whatsapp is a horrendous disease for your phone, I'd recommend using a real social media app for texts and calls instead.",1
com.whatsapp,William Anton,"Great app! Could you please add a checkbox for those who use cellular data under international roaming? I noticed that my phone does not perform a backup once the checkbox for cellular data is selected, mainly because I am using roaming all the time. In this case, it is only working when using wifi connection. Thanks!",5
com.whatsapp,ADITYEY SINGH,"Whatsapp is the best official apk for sharing photos, videos, documents and much more. It gives you complete security when you talk with someone. It's video call and phone calls are really good because you can make a call from one country to another country without any cost (only mobile data required). You can chat secure, call secure and a lot of things are secured 🛡️",5
com.whatsapp,Jennie Bean,"After new samsung update, my photos wouldnt show. If youre having the same issue, go to the device settings, apps and permissions. My photos and video permissions was unchecked (was checked before the update). Allow permissions for photos and videos again. It should sort the issue out. Hope this helps a few people.",5
com.whatsapp,Ashish Tiwari,"It is a best messaging and photo , video sharing software. But I think audio recording and video calling recording feature should be add in it while calling.although you all are upgrading it and adding some of the advance feature. Keep upgrading by which a user could get a better experience and don't face any types of problems while using it. I would like to thank all of your team members of the company who are doing hardwork with honesty 🙏 . Still My experience is good to use it. 🇮🇳",4
com.whatsapp,Onyii Amakam,"I really love this app...And the improvement and upgrades made on it. It's really get more interesting....🤗🤗. If you don't mind, I would like to suggest that some more features be added to it.... Such as video record, where one can drop a face recording of him/herself jxt as we drop voice recordings...I guess this type of feature exist in telegram.... Thanks 🤗🤗",5
com.whatsapp,Soumalika Basu,"Restoration of the backup process is full of glitches which can easily cause you to lose access to all your backed up chats, media, etc. Customer care is non existent when it comes to any solving issues. Automated messages are the most you can get out of them. For such a widely used app, this is extremely frustrating and disappointing.",1
com.whatsapp,titiz Costa,"Great App! There's just sometimes some glietiches but overall great! But i suggest that on status we can make them so only certain people can see, so of I'm making a surprise party, I'll make a status about it and put only the people that are going to be in it, in it! Another one, i think it would be fun to go live on WatsApp! The people on your chats can join and see! I would also like that i can record videos without pushing the button all the time but instead you click on it to make a video!",3
com.whatsapp,Hannan Zahra,"good app, all messages can be sent and calls can be answered perfectly fine. although, i really wish for status they could add settings. it would be much better if we could customize the fonts, how big and small it is, and so much more possibilities. with each update the size of the fonts keep changing, it was so good before, small just to my liking but now its way too big. i know for some people they would prefer big fonts, but i would prefer small ones.",3
com.whatsapp,Shashank mishra,"First of all app is awesome but need to update on Status Bar. For example some one wants to upload a video message to on Status,if he/she wants to share video which is more than 3minutes. So he/she have to post for 6times(30 second) that is very annoying. Update on Status bar,so we will post the video of more than 30 seconds in one time only. That will be very helpful for all of us.",4
com.whatsapp,Shubham Varun,"As a user of WhatsApp , I have seen one of the new feature i.e. Poll Selection . This feature is not so useful. One can change their option as per the majority of voters . This feature is useless . It's is not baised at all. Another thing is we can select both of the option at same it . It's the major drawback of this Poll Feature . Not accurate as well as trustable at all . According to me , you should modify this feature so that it'll be helpful for others.",1
com.whatsapp,Maya Sharma,"Good alternative for Messages, so you can chat cross platform, with read receipts, stickers, and actually somewhat decent quality video. Some changes would be suggested though. Most important feature missing, can't be singed in on two phones (or a phone and tablet) at once, unlike ¡Message. Also could better image and video quality shared.",4
com.whatsapp,Dolev Levavi,"""Something went wrong with your chat history..."" This happens to me daily for monthes now, daily! It is such a bother!! The 2 AM backup triggers this everyday, plus, sometimes it'll also accure seemingly at random throughout the day. Worst thing is, the restoration is not working properly and I have to guess when to force close it and hope to not lose days of my chat history. Many times I do lose several days and have to resort to reinstalling the app which causes of course the loss of settings",1
com.whatsapp,Jai Starr,"Since I had a recent update, the replacement WhatsApp keyboard has changed and there's no carriage return. You cannot have paragraphs any longer. Like what I'm doing. What are the developers thinking!!!! Derrrrrr Put back the original authentic qwerty keyboard with a carriage return, as opposed to this rediculas new send button replacing the carriage return. It is now a send button. How many send buttons does it need to have one, NOT two. It is a ZERO star for me.",1
com.whatsapp,Poetic J,"Edit: I take back my 3 * - I can't even post a photo status, it shows up blurry to others! Usually would be a 5 * but like so many others have said, since the latest update, the gallery attachments don't work properly now with android (Samsung) & now not even photo status. Previously couldn't send edited videos with sound. Why do these things keep happening?! Can this get fixed please WhatsApp?",1
com.whatsapp,Kepo Pisimi,"One app that has seen a tremendous jump in its users as well as public interest in last decade. All in one , from sending photos to documents to anything you need. It's like a full on power package and a reliable application with security and privacy. Love the way , WhatsApp team is continuously working to bring great updates and features. the layout and user interface and every feature is improving with time and hoping for more in near future. We expect a lot now from this amazing team.........",5
com.whatsapp,Erwin Steiner,"Local Backup doesn't work at all. Lost all my chat history because there is no option to simply tell Whatsapp where to find the backup file. It should be found automatically but it dosen't. Being a Software developer I'm pretty sure it's not my fault. But never mind, mostly switched to Signal anyway. Due to other reasons like data security and so on...",1
com.whatsapp,Marcelita Dlugosova,"I love WA but lately, I would dare say already months, I don't get any notifications unless I am right in the app. Calls are simply not ringing and often noticed after couple of hours like a ""missed call notifications""! It's very very inconvenient and I would vote for some fixing before I will be forced to swap my favourite chatting and calling tool. Thanks for taking into consideration!",2
com.whatsapp,Fatin Abdulrazzak,It is very annoying that some media can't be sent to more than one person at a time if it was forwarded too many times. This doesn't make any sense. It is an app to share thing with friends. What's the point in making restrictions. Another annoying thing is that some of the sent media doesn't load and that's very frequent and it's happening too often with so many poeple. That wasn't the case before.,3
com.whatsapp,Jai Shree Vohra,The recent update is the worst. Now you can't see all albums from phone on WhatsApp. Broadcast lists don't work (you can't find any pictures). The gallery is not available on one click and when you do go to the actual gallery you can select just one picture. Useless. Useless Useless,1
com.whatsapp,Lou Brown,"I am having problems with not getting notifications through, it doest show on the icon that have unread messages. If you can help please tell me what is going on? I have made sure all my apps are up to date, I am getting other notifications, all the settings seem to be set correctly and still not working.",4
com.whatsapp,Aakarsh Garg,"Good cross-platform alternative for Messages. Some changes would be suggested though. Feature missing, can't be singed in on two phones at once, unlike iMessage. Also could better image and video quality shared. Biggest drawback: doesn't use cloud storage (Telegram and Discord have implemented it). WhatsApp eventually takes up 10 GB on my phone and only option is to delete messages.",3
com.whatsapp,Princess Ezeuzoh,"Still much space needed that one has to dedicate all storage space in the phone and the forceful upgrade of the App is very annoying, even when one is not ready to upgrade. So frustrating. One should upgrade when one is ready to create the space. Imagine 292mb for this App upgrade! A very convenient and handy App. Great in all ramification except in data and storage consumption. Awesome indeed, very useful and almost indispensible and so easy to use!!! Consider blocking group than exiting.",4
com.whatsapp,Alexa C,"What on earth is going on? Half of the notification settings have been removed and what is available doesn't work. I turned the group notifications off yet still my phone has been blowing up since half 5, it's currently half 9. I used to be able to select who I can get notifications from specifically, that option has also gone. Pls stop changing things that make the application redundant. Thanks.",3
com.whatsapp,Himanshu Sahu,Overall it's one of the best messaging app. It's too smooth and gives best experience in conversation. But 1 thing which it should have and will be very appreciating is auto-splitting of complete video in parts while uploading status. If it can upload a complete video in parts of 30sec than it will be very good as it will not break the continuity of the video.,4
com.whatsapp,Ines Pernar,"I keep missing video chats because the phone doesn't ring. It's been happening for over a month now. Used to think that it had something to do with my phone, but the persons phone I'm calling also didn't ring, only notification shows up. Edit: Lately video chats are impossible because of the noise, everytime I say something, this terrible noise appears. It's so bad that it makes video chat impossible so we switched to another app. Please fix this noise.",1
com.whatsapp,Shamila Lethabo Adegboye,"The app's mostly fine. My biggest issue is that when I want to upload a video that's longer than 30 seconds and I trim it let's say somewhere in the centre, whatsapp does not save the trimmed part but instead, sends the first 30 seconds. As such, I'm always forced to use a video editor (InShot) and then forward to my WhatsApp status from there. Finally, please stop with butchering image and video quality; at least make it an option instead of forcefully compressing size and quality. It sucks!",3
com.whatsapp,D,"There are only a few things missing that would make me give this app a 5-star rating. Other apps let users respond to a message in a group via a collapsible thread. That would improve group chats in a big way to save space, because I know some people are annoyed by lots of text. Also, it would be great if sent messages could also be edited instead of just deleted. I have asked about this last part before. Editing saves time instead of deleting and typing over again. Apps like Telegram do it.",3
com.whatsapp,B L,"Oh dear! It's not sending messages, despite amazing internet connection. It's generally a good app. But rather than say memory too low it just removes some of my chat before I can back it up. Really upset ☹️ no reply from app. Also why is the video editor bit next to the back option. Stupid really as it loses the video if you go out by a millimetre.",1
com.whatsapp,Blue Diamond,"I love WhatsApp cz its easy to use & has many great features. But i recently installed dual WhatsApp and i noticed that not a single media shows up in my gallery or storage. I need to manually click on each photo/video and upload it to Google photos only then can I see them in my gallery.I have media visibility on, i have selected all media even for mobile data, restarted my phone and much more but nothing seems to work apart from manually uploading them on Google photos. Pls fix this.",4
com.whatsapp,J Chaudhry,"Good app, but what I dislike the most is that anyone who gets hold of your phone number can see that you have Whatsapp installed. It needs to change. If anyone wants to add you, the invitation should go through text message and only after you accept they should be able to see you on whatsapp. Also under privacy settings for last see, photo, and about, there should be an option for 'Only these contacts' so that any new contact you add will not automatically see it unless you include them.",3
com.whatsapp,Sanjida Akther,Great app indeed. But would like to suggest to add some new features. It would be amazing if there's an option to turn off online status so that when you're on WhatsApp others can't see it. The option should be customizable for certain people just like the status option provides. Last seen option should also have the exact same facility. Happy chitchatting guys!,4
com.whatsapp,Tioluwani Ogunnika,"It's been a good experience, please consider the following features as additions to the app. Deactivating autoplay/loading of status videos and pictures, activate a 'do not receive status update' for a specific period, clearing already received status, pinning or having favourites status updates. Hoping to see some of these features, if not all in the near future. Thank you",4
com.whatsapp,Bourne Vexed,Keeps telling me I need an internet connection when I already have one. This plus the other issues that most of us have already complained about which don't get fixed renders the app pretty damn useless at the best of times. Had to give it a star to write the review. Doesn't give the option to restore from backup lost all chats absolute shi*e. Won't be using it again. Was once a great app. Sick of all the issues.,1
com.whatsapp,linzi a,"Cannot see or download pictures or videos keeps giving error message. Plus when pictures are sent they cannot be seen they are just blurred out! The app crashes allot more since updates recently! And now the call quality is worse than before, sometimes can hardly use calls it just doesn't want to work! This used to be such a good application! But not just problematic sadly! I really wishe these glitches would be fixed",1
com.whatsapp,GR,"Messed up. 😡 They left everyone (even landline & toll-free numbers) in your Whatsapp phone book with an ""Invite a Friend"" link for each entry in your phonebook--Even if already listed as whatsapp users. Now cluttering the whatsapp contact list with this USELESS feature in the send a message screen. NO WAY to hide/remove. It's obvious the developers/owners are trying hard to get you to invite everyone to use whatsapp. Don't bother asking for help. Their auto responses don't help either. 👎",1
com.whatsapp,Jessica Newcombe,WhatsApp is a great way to communicate but it all comes down to when u start voice or video calls and your on WiFi but when your off WiFi and using your data it's perfectly fine. But when you use WiFi it always crashes and WhatsApp is down for no less than 2 hours. It's a joke!!! It's not just my WiFi or my phone either. I have tried multiple phones and WiFi and it still dose the same thing. I would not recommend this as most people like to call instead of text each other.,1
com.whatsapp,Emilia K,"This app is really annoying as: it doesnt notify me of messages half of the time and sometimes i don't get them (even thought my wifi is on and is very good) unless i literally have the app open allllll the time. And whenever i'm on call, after a while, it just starts cutting out and the call ends and needs restarting. Why?? Also, why do my reviews keep disappearing? So stupid",2
com.whatsapp,Nahida Kousar,"Worst app!!! I tried the new feature end-to-end encryption password on chat backup, but while trying to restore the chat backup, whenever i enter the password everytime it shows ""something went wrong please try again later"". I contacted WhatsApp and sent a mail along with screenshot but got no solutio. Why you introduced this feature when you have no solution to this problem.",1
com.whatsapp,Melanie Lowe,"Why is there no way to contact support? I can't get into personal WhatsApp or business. Both say no connection, try again, but it never happens. I can't access WhatsApp at all. I've been using the same phone number for the last 22 years. I've rebooted, uninstalled, reinstalled. My internet is working for everything but WhatsApp and I've tried to send a message on your website, but after filling it all in, there is NO button visible to actually send it, on phone OR laptop.",2
com.whatsapp,Goh Siping,"From bad to worst after the update. All files that wanting to share and send have to go to the most troublesome ways by going to files and select it 1 by 1. The camera taking through whatsapp is still blurry compare to taking pictures using camera app, and also the delay even at the best network area. Also this problem has always occurs everytime when there's a big update.",1
com.whatsapp,CA Rajesh Pabari,"The back up on google drive never gets completed. Suddenly in the morning something goes wrong with data, as it says on the screen. Whatsapp tries to restore and it does restore a month old data. Why in the world there are multiple everyday versions are being stored in the internal memory of phone? What's the fuss? Can someone explain?",1
com.whatsapp,Katze Root,"I'd give it negative stars if I could. An absolute HORRENDOUS app. Whenever I take a picture it takes a whole year to load it (and it's far from being my phone's issue), when I send 2 or more pictures to someone it kicks me back to the picture picker even if the photos still send, and the PC app on the Windows Store is absolute dogwater. It is so unstable it's not even funny. It's just sad.",1
com.whatsapp,Info,"I don't see why if you don't have the newest version of a phone you need to sacrifice receiving notifications. Twice now this app has stopped allowing me to receive notifications, claiming that the option is no longer available on my version of Android. Getting a new phone fixed it at first but that's not going to be an ongoing occurrence.",1
com.whatsapp,Gabriella Basi,"It's a great app and it worked perfectly fine for years UNTIL a few months ago when a lot of the time when I try to open WhatsApp, it lags SO much and takes like 10 minutes to open properly and send a message. I know for a fact that this has nothing to do with my phone in general because every other app on my phone works smoothly, and because a few other people I know have the exact same issue as I do, and the rest of their phone is working fine too. Thanks❤️",2
com.whatsapp,Cindy,"After an update, the whatsapp web really delayed. I can't view my previous message, document, links like before. And in my phone, it really not friendly user anymore. When i want to upload my picture , i can't attach it many in the same time. And i need to click it one by one. Please fix this. I prefer the older version of this whatsapp app.",1
com.whatsapp,Shaf Ahmed,"Hey Whatsapp Developer Team, The app is fantastic as the numbers and ratings already tell. I just wish there should be a way to turn off Whatsapp even when you are connected to internet, you are unable to receive messages until you turn it back on. Like a log in log off button without the hassle of adding credentials. Just a toggle button to either receive or not receive messages no matter you are connected to internet or not. Looking forward to such update soon. Other than that its awesome.",4
com.whatsapp,Naufal,"Completely exasperating experience with the backup and restore system. Neither the google drive nor the local backup able to get restored on the new phone. Not to forget the exhausting verification security system since I had to go back and forth just to get the chat restore working, which ultimately isn't. Media files are safe but had to manually copy and paste them to other places other than a phone.",1
com.whatsapp,Party Quest,"You touching things you're not supposed to. What I mean by that, is you touched something that wasn't supposed to be broken but you broke it. Listening to a 15 minutes message then replying to it and then trying to resume it where you left off, the message starts all over again and you cannot skip forward meaning you have to listen to 10 minutes of the same message to be able to finish the last 5 minutes really terrible.",3
com.whatsapp,randomitaliano,"Great app for texting. However the biggest issue is backing up the messages. Can't neither backup nor restore messages while roaming and having no wifi around. Wish I could log in on to my new phone and have all my messages on the ready like Facebook Messenger, without having to worry if I have backed up my messages from my old phone. Also, logging in seems to be a struggle as you might get send verification code to your number and never get it, as you might not have phone signal.",2
com.whatsapp,J D,"As much as I like, and use this app daily; I have one niggle, when on a video call. I have a z flip 3, and it automatically goes into split screen if I flip it up!

com.whatsapp,Dia Sheikh,"Quite recently, I'm facing an issue with the Online Status of my contacts. If I'm chatting with a friend, they are NOT shown online but as soon as they start typing, the typing status is shown. Same is true for recording audios. Problem is only with the Online status. Why is that happening? Kindly resolve this issue and I'll update my review to 5 stars. Thanks!",4
com.whatsapp,Idel Tanessok,"1)When posting a video on status, the video sometimes is not sync with its own sound which is very annoying. 2)When I select a large video for my status, it takes alot of time before loading. it's very borring please try fixing that. Maybe the app is trying to compress it. 3)Adding a way to separate group chats from other conversations will make the chat page less choked when there are many messages. Please try fixing it.",3
com.whatsapp,jonathan cohen,"I he options appeared without Audio. I tried the Photo/Video button and changed file type to All. I sent, but at the other end the ""Unable to complete download"" message WhatsApp on both my laptop and mobile. I had an issue with the Web version on my laptop. I had to send voice files that I made, to a group. When I clicked Attach , only five appeared. Eventually, I sent the voice files by mail to my phone and then sent them successfully by WhatsApp. Why no Audio button on Web?If poss please fix.",4
com.whatsapp,Lohkay,"This app is terrible, at first it was working perfectly fine until the app literally stopped being useable. Any time i tried to call someone? Black screen and the app would stop responding. Any time i tried to listen to a voicemail? App stops responding. Redownloaded many times to try and fix these issues but they kept happening. Dont download it, its garbage.",1
com.whatsapp,himanshu sharma,The app is good. Constantly improving and adding new features to it. WhatsApp may think to add a feature where a sender can send a message in an encrypted or in locked form which a receiver may unlock after a due date or on happening of certain event or after putting a password shared by the sender. This feature will help the people to convey their feelings or emotions on real time basis which they don't want the receiver to know right now right away. Looking forward to it.,4
com.whatsapp,Joseph Matimba,The latest update has RUINED the text status feature. Before the update the text would change size gradually from big to small depending on how much text was used. Now the text just drops to a very small font even with just 10 words. What's the point of text statuses if we have to squint to see them?,1
com.whatsapp,Oluchi Ogwuegbu,"The app keeps crashing. I have tried to install the latest update, this did not help. And there is no option to downgrade to previous update. Can't open, click on or respond to new messages. Or view /click old messages. Error message ""WhatsApp is not responding"".

com.whatsapp,Artur G,"Has become frustrating. Why cant I attach multiple images to messages anymore? Also, when selecting the gallery from the message attachments, the first thing that opens up is Whatsapp images folder, not my phone albums, which is annoying. Why break something that was working?? I contacted support about this and the only thing it replied was that Im probably using an unofficial whatsapp app, which is ridiculous. I'd give 0 stars if it'd be possible.",1
com.whatsapp,Umesh Babu J,As the app working is good but only one defect was found that when we delete a person message then after chat list was not showing based on the date list. It is showing the deleted person contact as a top list.previously when we delete anessage from one contact it will be removed and sorted based on the date of conversation now it's not working in Android users. Thank you,1
com.whatsapp,Ama Badu,"New community feature is terrible. It's not useful for 99.99% of users. I thought it's up to me alone to control it. But when I used it, it merged ALL contacts in the 2 groups that I added to the Community!!! Without prior notice and it notified everybody in those groups! As a result, some people left, because you can't use their numbers to merge in same community WITHOUT ASKING THEM! I was ashamed of what the What's App did.",3
com.whatsapp,Charith Dissanayake,"Biggest problem is that the more media you have in the chat, more time it takes to load media/files section. Telegram loads it almost instantaneously. Also it would be nice to store (encrypted) media on the cloud storage without consuming storage space on the phone. Also have Issues with chat not automatically scrolling down, and suddenly jumping way up when scrolling up.",1
com.whatsapp,sathyapramod belgaumkar,"The application was good until the recent update.. after updating, the new feature called ""Message yourself"" is actually not working properly and whenever i text myself and delete the texts, at the same time the display picture getting disappeared. I checked for several times and it's happened again n again. Kindly fix this issue.",2
com.whatsapp,WOBNIAR G,"This is helpful to contact people you want to contact yourself but is also unhelpful in the sense that it won't even let you send a message to someone without requiring access to your phone contacts. If I want to add them from my phone, I will, I don't need WhatsApp making it so that the option is forced out of my control.",3
com.whatsapp,Adrian Sándor,"Usually works fine for chatting, buy I hate that it's tied to a phone, fully proprietary, and somewhat crippled when not giving it the invasive permissions it requests (such as contacts). Also transferring chat history to a new phone is an absolute nightmare, doesn't work, and restore only happens when reinstalling, which has horrible timeouts for the verification code.",1
com.whatsapp,arolyo,Used to be good and the tech support is 10th rate. About 3 updates ago they managed to break a perfectly good app. The ability to send video stopped working with an unable to send video error message. To compound this none of my messages to tech support have born any fruit and have to explain the fault every songle time. Months later it still doesn't work. I now absolutely dread these mandatory updates.,1
com.whatsapp,Mona,"Good app. Works well for me. 12/01/22 update: since the last 2 updates I now have issues with notifications. Sometimes I get notified of new messages, sometimes I don't! Very frustrating! 🤨. I have to constantly go to the app to see if I've gotten any new messages.",4
com.whatsapp,Quiana Wiltink,"Worst update ever. I can't send videos from my gallery anymore and when you want to send pictures from your gallery you have click on the three dots and go to your gallery separately instead of having acces to it immediately when you click on ""gallery"" in the chat.

com.whatsapp,Aiden Mertin,"Generally great, use it as my preferred way to communicate with friends and family, but do have a couple of complaints: 1.

If we talk in a full video call like in a video call, then I can put my own video of any other video call there, But since this is your last update problem happen",3
com.whatsapp,Anthony Ezeh,"It's been a beautiful experience, but do something about the Media compression when uploading.

com.whatsapp,Brendan Chew,"Backup needs improvement, backing up either encrypted or not, takes HOURS. I will sit by my router literally for best connectivity with 1 Gbps fiber line and still take hours. I think a main initial 11gb backup is ok, but every subsequent backup take just as long.

com.whatsapp,Shailendra Chaudhari,"It is the best application to work with, we can chat , talk to anyone .You can add status so that everyone can have a look for the picture for a special events. I 'd love to say that this is the best application to talk,chat with anyone . You can even send sticker , emojis , gif . You can make video calls and send images , files ,ppt , exel etc.. I think it's the best ..........",5
com.whatsapp,Shreya Srivastava,It's a good app. But i think it must need some new salient features such as a Like❤ option on a status like an Instagram which may be helpful for the people who don't use Instagram. Through this they can show their feelings towards that people whom they like the most. Through this option the people who don't talk to each other due to shyness but they like each other can share their feelings. So i think the whatsapp should add this feature for making it more worthy.👍👍,3
com.whatsapp,Chris Rutter,"As mentioned previously, the latest issue now prevents the user from directly attaching photos taken with the camera.

Needs fixed!",1
com.whatsapp,Winston Mwamande,"User friendly. Simple but effective. I really like this app, one of the best ways to keep in touch with friends and family.

Of you do a Google search on the topic HUNDREDS of articles are written on it. Meaning it's been an issue, and for so long that hundreds of people wrote about how they fixed it.

For example it glitches and doesnt show if my message have been delivered unless i close the chat and re open it. Or if i'm on a call and the person doesn't respond and i call back, the camera freezes and it unfreezes unless i close the call. Each of your ""updates"" are just downgrades. Really disappointed of how WhatsApp have turned into. What is the use of this community thing? Why does my photos/videos compresses each time i send it?",2
com.whatsapp,Nermeen Emaduddin,LATEST UPDATE IS TERRIBLE. this is my worst experience since I've started using WhatsApp. it's been so bugged ever since the latest update; messages be sent and still be marked as 'unsent'.

Not sure if it's a Samsung or whatsapp glitch. I am messaging with a rep but feel it's a robotic rep. Added: I figured out the issue! I had to open permissions and go to whatsapp and add photos and videos""",2
com.whatsapp,Khalid Mehmood Arain,Overall the app is good and excellent. But now there is a time to insert some new and advance features like to have some password or pattern or fingerprint on some person chat or group setting will have also to be updated to have the lock 🔒 features. please make it sure for the case of privacy of every person. This will makes it more efficient and advanced for the users to use it as compare to GB and other whatsapps.,4
com.whatsapp,linda xx,"the new update is the worst thing ever - you can't even send one time viewing pictures (which you cannot make Screenshots off no more either which is completely dumb) from your laptop no more let alone open them - and for me, someone who uses their laptop for everything this is just so silly.

com.whatsapp,Srikalpa Bhat,Please remove the feature of veiwing status from profile picture by the side of the chat so that the mantra of connecting people of the app stays intact because I feel people will eventually start getting used to see status there itself then the status section of the app. Disappearing message is a really good feature🤩 include group chat also for Disappearing messages.

Because the receiver will always be ready to screen shot (it's not possible now, which is great) or screen record what they're going to see if they see view once icon on their screen. Please make this possible in the future update. Thank you.",2
com.whatsapp,Sinmi Oyedele,This app is becoming rubbish I can't increase volume of sound while watching a status and it keeps glitching every single time Your Video cannot play every single time I'll be trying to Increase the volume of the video watching a Status it will just show and stay the same actually telegram is better than WhatsApp this has changed my whole point of view,2
com.whatsapp,Graham Laird,Not Good on Pixel 7 Pro. The camera button in WhatsApp doesn't take as clear pictures as the camera is capable of taking. Particularly on the front facing camera which doesn't have a focus function at all in WhatsApp but also on the rear facing camera. It's far better to take photos in the camera app then click share and go to WhatsApp that way.,2
com.whatsapp,Mikołaj Kondratek,It is good until you need to move from Android to iOS. There is no way to move your chat history once the iPhone device is set up. Only paid 3rd party tools are available. Why don't you make it possible to restore Google drive backup regardless of the device type?,1

com.whatsapp,Hannah Parker,No idea what's happened to WhatsApp but now it doesn't show my photos to send. It only shows media I share with other contacts. It's incredibly annoying when this my primary app for contact. Tempted to swap to something else if this isn't fixed.,2

Recently got several updates but still doesn't work I don't know what's going on",1
com.whatsapp,Kristian Þ,Latest update has broken photo sharing functionality. As others have pointed out in recent reviews it's no longer possible to easily share images from your phone. I can only assume this is a bug but I've no idea how to report it so I guess we just have to hope they fix it and release an update,1
com.whatsapp,Oli Robinson,This was great but I can't send vidoes anymore to anyone for the past few weeks. Redownloaded the app maybe times but when I try to send a video it keeps telling me to restart my device. Plus I have data backup that all disappeared or won't load,1

All I get are variations of ""request a text and if you had many attempts - wait"". I do not receive texts I have waited for way too much time to get it resolved. There is zero help from Meta. At this point I have had enough and ready to switch. If your account is still ok - set up 2fa. I would not have this issue if I did.",1
com.whatsapp,Imran,"I can't use WhatsApp phone call and my phone at the same time, it mutes my voice for some reason and I have to stay on whatsapp the whole time.

com.whatsapp,OM,WhatsApp first of all I am thankful for you've added the poll feature which is super essential nowadays.Now secondy requesting you to add two more things.Adding a survey option in which questions might be asked and people might give the own replies instead of selecting pre-written replies in Poll. 2nd. Add a highlight message option in which the message might be highlited by admins/owner. This is not to be confused with Starred messages,5

com.whatsapp,Siddhant Shenoy,While scrolling there seems to be a new bug which directly makes us skip a few of the messages and secondly there seems to be an error with the message delivery system where I have to reload the app to know that the message is either sent or seen by the other person ( the tick and clock remains static while in the chat without changing until I come out of the chat),1

com.whatsapp,David Divine Tisha Lungu,"Simple, fast, quick and easy. Although, it doesn't have it's flaws here and there.

Anyway 4 stars, until this little thing is solved (then I give a 5 star review)",5
com.whatsapp,Max Rodriguez,The last two updates come with annoying issues when personalizing sounds for contacts.

Please fix this!",3
com.whatsapp,Rasilaben Mokani,"I like the app, but updates weren't getting worse till date. In the new update, Archived section shows on top!

Who would like to write caption again and again? Please improve the app. Otherwise my rating is 5 stars. Thank You.",4
com.whatsapp,Athar Khan,"Remove the image compression.

A user don't have to check all those criteria before sending image. Just remove the image compression and there will be no problem. Also, add feature to hide online status.",2

com.whatsapp,Eileen Ay,"This used to be a highly reliable five star app. But since May I have been unable to send videos. On top of that when I reach out for help, I get a bot response and nothing else. A few months ago I reached out and got a response that they were aware of the problem and working on it. I have updated the app, run through all the various troubleshooting I found online and nothing works. I'm pretty disappointed in this app. Ever since Facebook took it over, it has gone in the garbage.",1
com.whatsapp,Stella Adimchinma,"My experience in using the app is nice but I would appreciate it if you add my suggestion in your settings. I suggest you add a setting where by you can set your WhatsApp in such a way that only those people in your contact list can chat you up not some stranger you don't know, and not for one to wait until the stranger chats him/her up before blocking, but if there is such in existence already please I would love to be directed on where to see the setting in the app, thank you.",4

If we wanna send something: Status,Chats, Emojis and what not we think of can be sent to our close relatives/friends whom we miss. I love the new features but just one major problem that if we send a video of 3-4 minutes on Status we have to send the same video 5-6 times,as it only allows a video of 30 seconds.

com.whatsapp,Vincent Michael,"Honestly, I have no issue with WhatsApp until now. The update that shows a list of common emojis when replying to a status is a big flop.

I really wish something can be done about it. Thanks.",3

Secondly, even if we back-up all our data to google drive, it doesnot restore things properly, never. Most of images, videos & audios are not recognised they are shown to be downloaded again. And during the shofting process, most of the new unread messages are gone away. Pretty annoying. And there are yet many more issues.",2
com.whatsapp,UMMAY KULSUM ABBAS,"Nice app. But the latest update is weird, if I am clicking on a anyone's dp who has posted a status then it atomatically shows the status of that person, and If I want to see anyone's dp then I have to go inside that contact and then tap on the picture and then it will show a pop up box after that I have to choose whether I want to see the status or dp, so its a long process for watching dp.

My phone can do a billion interesting HD vibration patterns, all of which are quieter and less intrusive than even the ""short"" setting in WhatsApp, and all of which have no issues playing nice with my other apps.

I've got all my voice notes and all videos from last month saved on my phone and they are fine, but when I go to whatsapp to tap them, they say, ""sorry, this media file does not exist on your internal storage, when it does"". An admin shouldnt get to delete what others post, and why will only Admins be notified of a gc exit. Dumb. Fixing what ain't broken. I'd give it 0 stars if I could",1
com.whatsapp,Vishal N,Don't see the point of disabling screenshots altogether in disappearing photos. Atleast allow the user to toggle it off for themselves if they don't mind their photos being screenshotted. Or allow it on a per photo basis. The point of disappearing photos was to not clutter the storage and save only what was needed (by taking screenshots). This completely removes the benefit and reduces it's usecases to extremely few. Please allow users to toggle it off for their photos.,2

Have never been so annoyed of any app.",1
com.whatsapp,Riniam Tassar,Whatsapp just never notify me when i get messages. It's been like 5-6 months since it started to happened. I only get notification when i turned off my power saver mode and if i switch it back on it just doesn't notify me anymore and i have to go check on it myself every now and then to see if i have missed out on any updates. Please fix this issues as soon as you can!,2

com.whatsapp,Aafaq Ahmad,I am using this application. It is working very well. But if whatsapp company add a new feature in it then it will be very helpful. I recommend you to add the mention feature in status. So that one user can mention someone and if one person mention someone then the receiver get a message that someone mentioned you in his status. This feature will be very helpfull. It will like the Instagram story mentions. I hope you will check my feedback Thank you...,5
com.whatsapp,Lexi J,"Was great until recent update. Now when you go to a group chat it opens at the most recent message rather than your first unread message so you have to scroll endlessly to fond when you were up to. It also stacks repeated messages from the same person without repeating the contact name so it can get confusing tracking who messages are from in a group chat, particularly when people send repeated messages or are replying to someone elses earlier comment. Please undo these changes!",3
com.whatsapp,Programming Only,Suggestion: As of now status video length can be 30 seconds and if user want to keep longer length video on status then it needs to crop video for 30 sec again and again. So Whatsapp should add feature like once user choses longer length video it should allow to select from and to more than 30 seconds and automatically there should be split into 30 second chunks. May be the case like same feature is available but I am not aware of it. Sorry if already present. 1star for attention only else 5star,1

com.whatsapp,Isaiah Ackom,It's a very nice App and easy to use. Please work on the part that notifies someone of deleted file or text and the view once too. It has to be a surprise else the recipient will take a screen recording before opening what you sent. And please include the number of times your status is being viewed by one particular person. Would definitely give this amazing app a 5 star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,4

If you take a pic or a video it's gonna take the app hours to realize that you did and before so you won't be able to send it anymore from the app. You must get to the gallery and share it from there.

Let alone the videos which are a whole different kind of ball game..",1

But I wasn't able to use it because apparently I'm not allowed to without the ""performance improvements and features"" and have to click update because in 2022 it doesn't do it itself.

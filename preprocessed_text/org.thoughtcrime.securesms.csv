org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Julie Kim,"I love the fact that this message app is much more flexible. For example, without having to have certain phones, emojis are available to use for all. Another example is that I can delete messages if I didn't express properly or found typos. I just wish an editing feature was available instead of having to delete the entire message for whatever reason. Overall, this is my preferred method of communication next to Telegram app where all things I appreciate are available.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shonda Campbell,"The main reason I downloaded this is to have more security, privacy, & break away from everything Meta! I like the simplicity of the app. I do wish that we had more color options for the chat bubbles. It would be nice to have a darker chat bubble option, especially in the spectrum. For someone who has a light sensitivity, darkness is my friend. So maybe perhaps on the next update you guys could give us a more robust color option. Other than that it's wonderful! The ability to edit would be nice!",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Heather Stevens,Signal's decision to discontinue SMS support is upsetting. I will not juggle multiple messaging apps. I refuse. I cannot convince my entire contact list to change to signal. I LOVE this app as is and cannot justify multiple messaging apps. I dont even use multiple social media platforms. I'm genuinely sad this is happening. I love as much privacy as I can get but unfortunately convenience and ease of use is extremely important. Signal met all of the criteria until now. Disappointed.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Peter Stead,"I have really liked signal so far. I switch from WhatsApp because of their changing privacy conditions. Signal is much more private. The quality of the app isn't much different from WhatsApp. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I have downloaded pictures from signal to my phone a few times and the only way to do it is 1 at time. It's really frustrating that you can't just select multiple pictures to download. Also, video quality is poor when you video call someone.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Paul H.,"One of the best video messaging apps I have seen, and I have tested a lot of them - both as a professional Product / Project Manager and for my own personal 'gaming' interests. This is very nearly the perfect solution for every use case, and that is saying a lot. Increadibly flexible set of features and controls. I don't give many 5 star ratings, because there is always room for improvement- but this one is very near perfect.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kirk Degler,"I like that I can send end-to-end encrypted messages, but I don't appreciate the somewhat recent decision regarding SMS . I understand the logic, but I disagree. I would rather Signal have made UI changes to *really* flag/highlight conversations that are not encrypted. It's hard enough to sell X to people when they are used to Y. I also am not a fan of the decision to add stories to the application. Let's not make the app bloated and potentially increase the attack surface.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andrew Mann,"Biggest feature is encryption. But the rest of the app works better than all other messaging apps. Edit: Starting nov. 22, 2022, signal keeps crashing and stopped working. I restored from backup twice. First time it started working then crashed again after 2 days. Second time, it crashed as soon as i restored. Both times, it crashed while making a new backup. I'm still giving 5 stars, but just letting everyone know, if your backup is more than 6GB, this might happen.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jonathan Morford,"Bummed about the removal of SMS and addition of stories. To me, Signal is a communication app, not a social network. I do not intend to use stories and have turned them off. Conversely, I have contacts leaving Signal because they depended on the SMS integration to not have to figure out which app to message a contact with. The issues mentioned on the blog could have been resolved with better UI. As a techie, I do understand the challenges, but feel this change will ultimately hurt Signal.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Loki Hondorf,"Amazing app, has allowed me to bring several friends that aren't as concerned with privacy into a secure environment. However with the recent decision to drop sms, most of those friends will certainly be dropping the app and I may as well. The usp of signal used to be a single messaging app where e2e encryption is avalible cross platform. The app serves little to no purpose if I only have 1 or 2 contacts on it as there are plenty of channels where this protected communication can happen. Sorry",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jonathan Love,Please add scheduled messages and editing messages. Format of wallpaper needs some adjustments after you've selected a picture is zooms in and looks of bad quality. Great app and better alternative to WhatsApp and Google Chat. So far the features are pretty standard. You can send decent quality video/photos. No 4k HDR like iPhone but it's a step in the right direction. Please donate!!! No this isn't sponsored ü§òüèæ,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Zachary Hendershot,"The decision to drop SMS support is absolutely unacceptable, especially given the decision to add stories. You've replaced a feature that I used every day with one that I will never use. I don't buy for a second that it was to focus on encrypted messaging, you added useless garbage. Yes, I realize that my SMS conversations were not encrypted, but it was beyond convenient to have everything in one application. Formerly five stars, it was a good run.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aaron Firouz,"Signal is pretty great both as a standard messaging/chat app and as a secure communications tool. I've had mixed success trying to get folks off iMessage or SMS, but those that have switched have been happy with the experience. That said, recent decisions like adding payments and ""Stories"" are a little concerning. I'm sure both can be done while respecting privacy and they are intended to increase appeal, but they feel like bloat and a bad direction for the app.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Devon Parker,"This messenger is decent. However you cannot edit messages, and they just took away the ability to delete an image a while after it's been sent. Now in order for messages to disappear you have to set up an automatic timer and you cannot delete images you've sent manually after a few hours. This decision doesn't make any sense. Normally I'd probably give the app a solid 4 stars, but until this ability that already existed is restored I can't recommend it.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Paul Metzgar,"This app was a great all in 1 app. I could text, video chat, and send photos to family and friends from around the world whether they had Signal or not. Sadly, the company has foolishly decided to remove its unencrypted messaging service. I cannot have an app on my phone that will not accept unencrypted messages. Google, Microsoft, and other companies that send verification messages will not get through under the new update. I will be replacing this app as soon as I find an adequate replacement",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Abhijeet Malik,"Privacy first class. Security first class. Backup / restore ability third class. Especially for cases when you need to switch phones or just loose / damage your phone, you don't have any solution. I understand the background of privacy and security to ensure the data is not hacked / exploited. But there should be some ability to configure profile, so if you chose a less secure profile, you are able to backup messages etc. On cloud and restore it late. Different users have different requirements.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Deatria Cameron,"I like Signal. It's intuitive to use. I'd give it five stars if it had better integration of notes to self, one tap button record (The slide feature is awkward and not precise), and if the developers shifted phone number sign in to regular account sign in, to easily log into your personal account on any device including any phone numbers.... It's just super silly to have issues accessing one's account on another phone. They do need to make proper improvements, and this app could get five stars.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aurora M,Having only one app to receive all text messages was golden. Signal should recognize when the app is not installed and allow users to deactivate and unlink with the phone. Previous Signal users that no longer have the app do not receive any text messages. It's very frustrating. This new change to not receive sms texts only force me to use a second app. Ads are a nuisance.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Freya Black,"It was nice to use to start off with, but as time goes on, it's getting worse. Messages won't send at random. Can't message people that don't use signal, especially if it is set as my default texting app. I like some of the features, but it's a messaging app. If it won't send simple texts, there is no point in using it. Edit: still doing it. I'm so done with this app",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,G A,"Fantastic tool, sort of... My concern was when I moved from one phone to another,but that proves to be a moot point. The tool to transfer works great! No msgs lost, pictures were even moved. Love it. Great job! However, not being able to send/recieve from other SMS app, usefulness significantly drops. I have to have another app to send messages to people who don't use Signal. I understand your decision, but I regret you made that choice.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Rudy Messex,"As signal operates today, it is useful and easy. After the sms capability goes away I have no intention of trying to keep track of who has signal and who doesn't. Today, I have a single platform that encrypts when it can but still functions when it can't. I've donated to the project because it was great. But we all have to deal with contacts that will never switch to Signal and I'm too busy to check if someone is on signal when I have to send a message. Sorry to see this change.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Morgan Montgomery,"This was my default messaging app for the last couple years, and it worked great! However with Signal ending SMS service it just doesn't make sense to use it anymore. I just don't have enough Signal-using contacts to make multiple messaging apps worth it. I have many contacts who would not be willing to move (and it's a harder sell now than it was before), and I won't be able to receive automated messages anymore either. I'd gladly come back if SMS service was restored but for now it's goodbye.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andrea Waagen,"I thought I had finally found the perfect app! And for over 3 years it was amazing. Now I am forced to go find a new SMS app to be able to message anyone WITHOUT Signal. I can't get notifications from UPS/FedEx etc. I can't text my 80yo mother. I will probably just delete the whole app. I loved it!! But I hate the inconvenience of having multiple apps to do 1 simple thing. Shame on you, Signal!!",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Patrick Gray,"It's great software, but the removal (WHY?) of SMS text message support is a huge step backward for Signal. Now, instead of managing all my messages in one convenient location, I have to juggle two apps - one for the 10% of my contacts who value privacy, and another for the remaining 90% of the world who either don't care, or who use something other than Signal. What a bone-headed move. Cutting off SMS only means that Signal users will fall back to whatever app supports the most contacts.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Michael Forseth,Great app until they took away my favorite feature. They announced they are removing SMS. I really liked having a secure messaging system and SMS available within a single app. I was able to keep all my conversations in one place. It was great when I had a friend or family who refused to get signal. I don't really plan on using signal anymore without this feature.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tiny Tiger,"I have loved this app for years. BUT the fact that they are discontinuing SMS services instead of putting it in a separate tab or having it be a paid service is a real shame. On another note it has me putting in my pin constantly, not just when it asks you to verify every once in a while. It's every time my phone restarted and then for what seems like no reason at all sometimes. So it ends up coming up multiple times throughout the day, and then it's multiple times of putting my pin in.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,X X,"Revert back to the old view, where each person's circle is it's own solid color, and THEIR TEXT, NOT MINE, is highlighted in that color. We should at least have the option to configure this ourselves if you insist on forcing a design overhaul on everyone. Now you're configuring the app such that I cannot communicate via signal with people who don't have signal? Three goes the one of the main advantages of this app. Great move!",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Euclid Megara,"Noooo! You can't remove SMS support! The thing that makes this app so great is that all my texts appear in one place! When I convince friends to join Signal it's seamless! About 70% of my messages are encrypted, in part because it's so easy to bring people over! If you take away the SMS then the quiet integration of encryption is lost. That's a big loss!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jessica Duncan,I've used signal for a couple of years and never had an issue until recently. The app froze and would not function even after reinstalling. Lost all messages because the backup function would not work due to freezing. I've been forced to return to the factory installed messaging app. Will give it a try another time when the issues are resolved. I've noticed many have experienced similar issues around the same time - last Sept to early Oct.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,AAA LLL,"This was a fantastic app until the decision to remove SMS support. The unified SMS and encrypted message experience was FANTASTIC for managing messages and helped convert many people in my circle to using it. No one (myself included) is going to deal with multiple text messaging apps. What a terrible user experience. Signal has been great historically, but it's time to move on to something else.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,kea charmak,"I really appreciate this app and all the flexibility it offers. The one thing I'm really missing from it is the ability to pin a couple of posts to the top in a group. I want to be able to pin a calendar, a meditation and directions to different events throughout the month. Whatever's most current for whatever we are up to. I get tired of scrolling through trying to find things. ALSO...After being added to a group I'd really like to be able to see the old posts. Thanks!!!!!",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Kelsey Marie,"UPDATE: Dropping sms messages makes this app obsolete for me. Mostly was going okay but recently it crashes or won't open often. If i leave it open and go to another window it won't let me come back to it, and forces all my windows to close when it crashes. Makes it a frustrating app to use. Edit: Recent updates have really improved performance. Using it regularly now with very little issues.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Brandon Ragland,"Works well and I can trust that the communication is secure. No one can protect you if the other party gives up messages or had backups on even though you're using time-out conversations. So in those cases it's best to know exactly who you're talking to and can be certain they can be trusted. As far as the computer IT security, Signal is safe and secure. As a software engineer, I trust this app far far more than other popular apps claiming to do the same. This app ""just works"" and works well!",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jimmy M,"Started off well enough. Thumbs up for privacy. BUT, aside from dropping SMS (which is NOT GOOD!) it doesn't work AT ALL when sending/receiving messages, even with another Signal user when separated by less than a quarter mile. Might be my carrier, but it is really annoying, especially when it's a very important message.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Steve Buttner,Think this app is great. Never gives me any trouble. Love the fact of the warrent proof end to end increption . Highly recommend it. Haven't used the video of voice yet so can't say about that feature. Takes your wallpaper. Multiple caller notification tones for each of your contacts. Can't think of anything I'm unhappy with. Of course like any app you must become familiar with it to be fluid with it. I'm happy with it which I can't say about a lot of my apps. Get it. Privacy is becoming lost.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A,"Excellent app lots of useful features. I am very disappointed to see SMS support discontinued. Although many of my contacts have Signal, many do not. The convenience of having a ""one stop shop"" for all of my messaging needs was fantastic. Unfortunately I think this decision will be very detrimental to the future of the Signal project. Granted SMS is inherently an unsecure protocol, most users are aware of this and will ensure sensitive communications are to a recipient with the app.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mari Schneider,A great app that can be used as a drop-in replacement for most other apps. It offers great security when messaging someone else with the app and falls back to unsecure messages when the recipient doesn't use the app. Edit: Signal will no longer support SMS messages. Basically you can *only* talk to other people on Signal. I will unfortunately have to uninstall Signal and find a new texting app.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,James Studer,"I really liked this application's ability to send secure text messages. However they recently decided to block SMS messages since they weren't secure. I will probably have to go back to the standard message app because I have to be able to communicate with a lot of my friends. Signal should just highlight the non-secure messages with a different color, like pink or something, to let the user know that say non-secure connection but Banning all SMS messages is a bit draconian.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jilly Bear P,"Unfortunately since SMS messaging will no longer be supported, I really won't be using it. As another reviewer stated, it is difficult to get other contacts to sign on to using a new messaging app. I was already frustrated trying to send short videos to non-users & getting ""message failed"" notifications. I had to switch to my old app to send videos in those instances which was a pain.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Firmino Martinez,"I was a little surprised by how easy the transition was in using this app, from the basic SMS app. I do wish I could import my conversation history, but that really only matters to me for the first few weeks, so I only had to switch to see what we were talking about earlier. After using this app for a couple weeks, I definitely recommend it. EDIT: the moment SMS support is discontinued, I'm uninstalling the app. It has little value without it, and I hate that I have to search again.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Nathan Harold,"The best modern messaging app. It's simple, clean, inituitive, and above all, actually private. Side note I recently had to transfer to a new phone and the process was both simple and fast. My other fifty-plus apps could learn a thing or two about backup and restore from Signal.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Carl R,"Edit: removed SMS, so dropped rating to 2 stars. Probably the best and most secure texting app out there. Telegram has had breaches and WhatsApp is owned by Facebook (hard no). Now with the new updates they've been putting out the last year or so, this has become not just the most secure, but the best texting app on the market! It's got everything you need, can do phone calls, can answer texts on your computer, can make groups or schedule when to have messages deleted!",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Larry ‚ÄúBrad‚Äù Prager,"Love it! Best messaging app I've ever found. 3/22 < Sadly, my opinion in the previous sentence is no longer true. Because Signal no longer supports SMS messaging I am forced to find an alternative messenger, again. I can understand the concept of wanting to make the continuing development of your app and easier process for yourself, I can also understand the concept of bringing about change, which you have to some extentl. But let's face facts. The MAJORITY, continue to support SMS messaging.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Timothy Eccleston,"This was a great app until they killed their killer feature, which was letting (Android) users send SMS in the same app, which made it so much easier to track normal conversations. Now I've been driven out to look for SMS apps and found ones with better UI. I care about encryption so I don't want Signal to tank, but I wouldn't be surprised if this does it. :( I've already gone from promoting and donating to this app to neither, but that would change if they brought SMS back.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,robvc7,"Removing SMS support is why this app gets one star. I love the security of Signals end to end encryption. But not everyone I talk to is interested in downloading a separate app. That's what made Signal so awesome. I could have the secure conversations with some and keep texting with everyone else all in one convenient app. With that going away, Signal is no longer convenient for me or anyone else I know. And since I refuse to use two different messaging apps, Signal will have to be uninstalled.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,shepherdgroup. biz,Stories. Bad idea. Don't need the garbage. And now it's crashed. Top marks for doing what they are doing. Not sure anyone would tell Signal if they've broken the codes but presumably there are plenty of independants out there that would love the publicity. The most important part for me is the privacy and efficient data use. Not worried about stickers etc but I'm sure many people are. As long as things aren't there by default and we always have the ability to remove features we don't use...,4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chuck Anderson,"I mostly like the app, but I have two issues: 1. Why is SMS support being removed? 2. The way notifications work for group texts. There needs to be a way to mute notifications after the first time someone sends a group message, either for a time period or until the message is read. Otherwise there is a flurry of notifications when other people in the group are having an ongoing conversation while you may be busy and unable to read/reply. A total group mute isn't ideal.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Trevor Wunn,"Signal was perfect until they removed sms support. I was using it as my default messaging app, but I can no longer do that. It's extremely disappointing they've chosen not to continue with the support. I literally cannot convince everyone I know to switch to signal, a big selling point was to have it replace your main messaging app and they've gotten rid of that. Unfortunately, I'm going to remove it as go back to messages.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Panda Greenwell,"Went from being my favorite to most of my friends who used it uninstalling it after they stopped sending to SMS. Now, it won't open, just sits at the load up screen, and if I send a picture or something directly, it takes more than one try for it actually to go through. And who cares about the ""story"" function? This is FB messenger.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Hyperbolic ‚ÄúHaipa‚Äù The Artist,I used to be able to send videos. I mean yeah the options still there. But now no matter HOW short I cut them they just dont send. I used to be able to send them in 5 min segments. Then it was cut to 2Min 30Sec segments. Now it doesn't matter if its just a couple frames I cant send a video period. And before you ask. YES I CHECKED MY INTERNET CONNECTION. I have 4g LTE 3-4 bars CONSTANTLY. Thats very good and solid yet I cant send a 30 second clip over it? neither can my boyfriend on WIFI.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Don Turner,It's too bad that Signal developers have decided to remove the SMS feature. Removing functionality often forces people to find other solutions. It's still a good option for encrypted messages and international discussions outside of building a private server. Sadly I do not want to use two apps and will have to switch to another application.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jason F.,"I very much appreciate that texts are encrypted. With Big Tech and information all over the place, a reliable texting app is very convenient. It's quite the useful app too: audio texts, video calling, in-app photography, and more. However, there are occasional slight bugs with the chats: they may jump around, or the background may randomly change colours when you swipe. This stuff is forgivable, but video calls can lag and get pixelated. Other than that, this app deserves a solid 4-star rating!",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Marc Kan,"It is great as long as both parties are on Signal, but if not, one or both of you may not ever receive the messages and you don't know until you talk to that person again. Switching in and out of Signal requires choosing it as your primary messaging which is highly annoying. I'd rather it were a stand alone like WhatsApp. Group texting is a nightmare with unending notifications and MMS failures showing up as individual messages from each person outside the group chat as well as in. Please fix",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,P E,"It mostly works. No matter what i enable, i don't get notifications untill i open the app. By that time i can see that i have a new message. I now have to remember to open this app to see if i have messages from the few friends that use it. I can turn off notifications and back on. They work for a day or so then go back to not working. Very frustrating.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Joe,"Works Great! You can send encrypted messages, self destructs messages, and regular texts (if default app). The only downside I would say is that it broadcasts your number being on Signal to contacts. This isn't a social media platform so I would prefer an option for privacy. With that being said, you can change your Signal number to any phone, even landlines so the possibilities are endless.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,John Kulju,"Very good messaging app. Does what it says. I used WhatsApp for 9 years before discovering Signal, and initially thought WhatsApp was better as there are functions I didn't see on Signal. After using Signal for a few months though, the only dislike I can remember is that it shows message time as how many minutes have passed, rather than the actual time of the message. Depending on your outlook, and whether you chat across time-zones, this could be a plus when referencing a previous message.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jacques Clouseau,"I may get rid of this app soon. Used to be great. Heard they are going to force their app on your contacts that don't have it to work, but only for Android users; guess ios users get a pass (shame, shame). Constantly crashes while sending photos. Asks to resend and fails. Have to reboot phone to send them and that's iffy at best. For another strange reason, I can't send large files or video that other messaging apps can, and it's not the apps settings either.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Generic Dude,"It's one of the most recognizable secure messenger platform out there. Runs smoothly, without any real problems. It's probably doesn't have much in terms of problems due to it's simplicity. There is no video chat or voice chat so there's a lot to be desired if you want more. Telegram or Element, would be better for those seeking more then text communication.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,badger codes,"It doesn't make sense for us to keep using a messaging app that we can't send text messages from. Having time to tell our friends who don't have Signal that they should add a second messaging app, and then keep track of who has Signal and who doesn't, is a hard sell. For those of you who are as dismayed as I am, Telegram is feature-rich, and I believe the is a plugin in F-droid that will let you use it for text messages as well. This really sucks, though. Farewll, Sig, after many years.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Joseph Sampson,The latency is terrible. Sometimes up to 15 minutes for just a normal text message to go through showing double checkmarks of delivery. All other types of chat Messengers are going through just fine to the same contact. This is happened on multiple devices consistently for a long period of time. I was hopeful that this was going to be my new messaging service app.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Crystal Rios,"Love the app, but since the last update, some of my messages will give me a failed delivery notification, but will send with no problem when I resend it. Idk why it's doing that now. It's a bit annoying. This is on a Samsung s10 of that helps. *update 10/16/2022* So it feels like the messaging has gotten worse. Now most messages give me a failed to deliver error and I have to resend once or twice for it to actually send. Can you look into that?",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chelsie Smith,"Amazing experience for past 2 years, however with the regular SMS messaging going away, I will have to find another messaging app and honestly may get rid of Signal all together. Right now Signal is a one stop shop for all my messaging needs. I can't force people to download ""one more app"" because I would prefer to use it during our messaging. So disappointed.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Drew Graybeal,"Opportunistic encryption has always had the highest chance of succeeding in populations that don't actively seek it out (see https and imessage). Signal's dual use of both encrypted messages and sms function did this. Unfortunately, the small number of contacts I have that also used signal isn't worth keeping the app installed on my phone. Deleted my account, and will be looking for a different solution that provides opportunistic encryption for SMS.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Tyler,"Love this app. It's genuinely the closest thing to a universal iMessage out there. And it doesn't hurt that the company who runs it isn't evil (looking at you Meta and Apple). I can send large files (videos, pictures, etc) without loss of quality, make both voice and video calls, and send messages encrypted end to end between Signal users. I've removed a star however because they are dropping support for SMS. I was nice to only need 1 app for all my messaging needs.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Daphne,"Sometimes call quality isn't as great, but overall prefer it to Whatsapp for private messaging! Also love how you can change the color scheme to suit your phone theme. And I find the 'Note To Self' feature really useful which I've pinned to the top of my chat thread. I would like to have a Signal web version though so I can easily access my messages on my computer from any browser.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Mahlia Maverick,I've used signal for a long time across several different phones. Today it's suddenly had issues trying to create backups and just got the notification it won't be able to receive sms messages. Ridiculous. I should be able to get other messages that aren't signal to signal apps. Not down to use multiple messaging apps. Not happy.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Brennan Murphy,Extremely disappointed there will no longer be SMS support. Makes it that much more difficult for non-tech family & friends to communicate. Most people aren't going to navigate multiple disparate messaging apps and will default to preinstalled SMS. Fracturing this ecosystem helps no one. We'll be back to blue bubbles vs green bubbles once again.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Sly Cedix,"The removal of SMS is the worst step this app could have taken. The major draw for the layman was opportunistic encryption. By forcing users to use two apps like all the other e2e messengers do, they are going to swap back to SMS in full, not paying attention to who is on signal and who is not. After this, I'll be going from approx. 80% of my regular conversations being on signal to almost certainly 1 or 2 conversations max.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jeff Murphy,"Used the app for years, loved it being a one-stop-shop all for all of my messaging needs, both secure & unsecure. It also made it easy to get other people on board. I'm disappointed they are dropping support for SMS & MMS messaging. Hate having to go back to using two apps to be able to message all of my contacts.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Zach Briar,"While I understand the idea behind it, the decision to remove SMS support means it's pretty much impossible for me to convince anyone to start using signal. Without SMS functionality, signal it's just one of a plethora of closed-ecosystems with secure messaging. I was waiting to stop using signal hoping they will reverse this decision, when I saw they added a ""Stories"" feature. I don't need social media shoehorned into every app I use. I will not be returning to Signal.",1

Sad, looking for something better and more secure.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Adam Claussen,"Signal used to be wonderful. It was secure for signal to signal messaging, and it gave me the option to text unsecurely to all other people.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jesse,Signal is removing SMS support. This was the key feature that made this app useful for me as it allowed it to replace my SMS app and slowly encourage my friends and family to switch to encrypted messaging.

Prior to this, I would be able to use Signal as my default messaging app, allowing me to use it regardless of if I was texting someone who used signal or not. This meant that I didn't have to use 2 different apps to text. Now, it will only work when using with others who use Signal.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Leaving_The_Wolf,"Great app, been using it for some time. There's going to be some new changes soon. Signal gonna no longer send messages outside of signal. I understand the point of it. Though when this is your main messenger and it's doesn't send work like so. Kinda useless. Im gonna have to stop using this app. Before this change 4/5. After this change 2/5 since it's pretty useless at that point.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Derek Price,"Signal has been my source of truth for messaging for several years. I liked it, recommended it to family and friends and one of the main features was that it could handle both encrypted and unencrypted messages. They are removing that feature to focus *only* on Signal to Signal communication. No more can I use Signal to text my iPhone owning sister and my Signal using wife from the same app. This was a 5-star app. Now it's not.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,J B,"Edited review for October 2022: I've been using Signal for years. Now, because they're no longer supporting SMS texts, I will have to get a different app. This is a very bad decision on their part. Nobody cares about privacy, and so nobody will use this app if they can't do normal texting as well, because nobody wants to switch back and forth just to talk to people. Watch the userbase for Signal drop of a cliff.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,D_ Pete,Update Nov 2022: I am so totally frustrated and disappointed with the news that Signal is removing sms support. The integration of sms into an encrypted message app is absolutely magical. I can see that I am not alone in my feelings on this issue and truly hope that Signal will reconsider this horrible decision and focus on the needs of its loyal users.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,J Jack,"It would be nice if my text came through the Bluetooth in my cars. I also don't get text messages on my watch, but I get my emails, calendars and alarms. Also the feature to schedule a text would be good to have a well.",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Nasty Bug,"Nice app, but started crashing a lot recently. Idk what's wrong, have cleared all data and it still crashes. Didn't change anything, today was the first time it happened since the last update, so i suppose update is not the reason. Please help, i would love to use signal further.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jefferson Eagley,"They are removing SMS/ Text message support. That kinda kills it for me, since I'm now stuck using Google again. The fact that they tie accounts to phone numbers is a serious deanonymizing vector. Not actually secure when they have a personal identifier that specific. Too tightly coupled with your contact list.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,N Norris,Signal's decision to remove SMS support in the near future takes away a huge amount of its utility for me and for most of my contacts who use it. Having one simple app with a good UI for private messaging AND sms was great while it lasted. I will not continue to use signal once SMS support is removed.,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Nicole Kellett,"Love this but wish it was on my watch as well so I could read messages there. Having to have EVERY single contact on this app to be able to use it is ridiculous. Not only are there always going to be people who don't want to use it, it means things like my doctors office, UPS, Uber, etc wouldn't EVER work either. I can't imagine anyone is going to keep this app.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Alex Gough,SMS and Encrypted messages in the same app. A desktop app is also available Edit: lowered to 3 stars and they are removing the SMS feature. It's no longer beneficial for me to replace the default app so it's useless has dropped massively.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Guillermo Gutierrez,Dont export you sms messages right away once you do you will no longer have the sms feature. Absolutely loved this app one of the best sms experiences Ive had but now that the feature is being removed it pretty much unusable as only about 1-5% of my contacts actually also have the app. Really sad to see the sms feature go.,3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Fletcher Beverley,"About to wreck the experience by removing SMS/MMS integration. Currently about 20% of people I know use Signal, the majority of them are unlikely to continue to use Signal if it's not a one-stop-shop. Which is unfortunate as the privacy benefits of Signal are exceptional.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Shadow,"I love this app and use it as my preferred texting app, but they've recently announced they're going to end sms support for it in favor of encrypted messaging. While I love the encrypted messaging aspect of it, I want to continue using Signal for all my texting needs but now can't because 99% of the people I communicate with don't use Signal",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,dwr dod,"not privacy oriented but collects user data. why do i need to enter my phone number? random ids would be enough, just like threema. hard to back up and restore. porting between phones requires both phones to be alive. So of old phone go4 bricked then restoring from titanium backup wont work. on one hand they make it ""hard"" to crack on the other hand they ask for person data",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Angelica Lambert,"Experiencing glitches after recent update, along with messages not being delivered to me/ push notifications no longer working. I have to open the app to see any of my messages. And no it is not an issue with my phones notification settings",4
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Steve Custer,"Used to be a 5, removing SMS / MMS makes it more difficult to convince others to use it. Even Apple understands that it's easy enough to color code messages so you know if they're secure or SMS. I hope Signal walks that decision back and makes some simple UI adjustments.",3
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,m C,"Signal is still the best app for encrypted messaging. No one in 2022 or beyond should sti be using plain SMS, there is just no excuse. Signal is simple, easy to use, and easy to start getting your friends and family to transition to it from insecure, unsafe SMS.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Systemadminvzw.admin Systemadminvzw.admin,"It was great, then I had to replace my phone and now for some reason mms will not work. Tried all of the fixes that I can find. Signal support no help. What's up fellas, can we get this fixed. Noticed a lot of people uninstall and that's it. And that's a bummer",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Spencer pettijohn,"This is the best encrypted SMS app. They are however removing the ability to communicate over unencrypted SMS. I'm going to have to move to What's App when they make this move because the majority of the world will not migrate to secure messaging just because a somewhat obscure application enforces it. While I understand the teams goals in doing this, it will make it difficult to keep using this application If it cannot be my default SMS application.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Eric Wakefield,"Taking away SMS support is a huge business mistake, in my humble opinion. Myself and many others will not use multiple messaging apps to send text messages. As soon as SMS leaves Signal, Signal leaves my phone. I hope the developers will reconsider their business model, as businesses want to grow. For the life of me, I can't understand how taking away a major feature of an app will result in growth. In the meantime, I'll keep using Signal because I love it and will hope for a change in decision.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Allister Smith,"Works fine as a messaging app. Americans need to stop using default messaging apps and catch up with the rest of the world. End to end encryption is nice, but remember that it only works if the recipient is also using signal. Sending texts to your grandma who uses android messages is still going to be unencrypted.",5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,D L,"They're dropping sms, that's the thing people use to text. Even though I would prefer for everyone I talk to use encrypted messaging, the reality is that people are drawn to the most insecure, anti privacy, junk like Snapchat & Instagram. The only other way to talk to people is with archaic SMS, which is the standard. Signal can't find a way to convert users to a better messaging standard so they're just going to give up on users, pathetic.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Patrick Tracy,"PrettyGoodOverall. ButWhenMakingAudioCallsItRequiresUsersToGivePermissionToTheAppToRecordTheAudio. Definitely not something anyone would want to do w/o a legitimate explanation. IMHO Sig. should make a ""loud and clear"" statement to everyone using the app that any ""recordings"" of audio or video are solely for the function of the app, and are deleted immediately after the intended receiver receives them, and that no one can spy, including Sig.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,mark fuller,"Stable, easy (could be better, categories etc. ). Downvoting now because the SMS exit. It's been my goto for SMS/secure for years. SMS has been my ONLY path to get friends and family to even try it. Goodbye organic growth, adoption will crash, and signal will wither. Nice while it lasted.",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jay Dee,"If I am reading the Signal message correctly, it means this app can only function between signal users. The majority of my contacts are not on signal.

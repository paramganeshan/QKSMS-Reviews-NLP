xyz.klinker.messenger,Mitchell Sommer,"The only reason I used this app is because of its ability to schedule messages, but it didn't come without a cost. There were multiple instances, in group texts and in texts with individuals, where it would show that a message went through from my end when it actually didn't. I just switched back to my default messaging app, and right when I did that, everyone got a total of around 100 texts that never went through. I have a Galaxy A52, if that provides some context.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,craig sonis,"Been using this for the past year. It's excellent in all aspects except for one thing that I can't seem to find a solution. When sending a photo I often want to save data, so I just want to send a reduced photo size (MB to k). The only want to do this is (I think) is to attach the photo picking from a secondary Photo App on my phone which will attach the reduced photo size. Fix that for 5 stars as I use this all the time.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,badger codes,"pulse is okay. it's a paid version of qksms or textra, but without any additional features to warrant the subscription fee. pulse gets the job done in that it sends and receives messages, but there's no real development or premium features that i have noticed. if one were to set their dns to block ads system-wide, and then go with a free, reputable messaging app, the experience would be identical.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,arnold r,"I've had Pulse SMS (free) for a few years and it served me well. Recently switch phones to a Pixel 6A. I was able to copy over the app (and text messages) w/o a hitch. However, it keeps asking me for the Paid version trial, and can't get past that pop-up screen. I had to switch messaging app because of this.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alison Milne,Been using Pulse for years and was happy with it. Until today. I got a new phone and had problems transferring data. I download the app thinking it's the same old app. These POS's let you download the app then immediately want you signed up for their monthly or yearly plan. No option to stay on the free app. They can FO to the nth degree.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark Young,"Used to be a good app to sync between phone and PC, I can no longer sync with my PC or send messages from there. I've contacted support and followed all directions with no improvement. Going to use Google Messages from now on, it's free and I wasted money on a lifetime subscription to Pulse. I would have given 5 stars if it still worked.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,BC,"Edit: originally gave it a one-star rating. Leaving a one-star rating. Even after getting the subscription issue straightened out. This app will not send an MMS message or picture message. It doesn't matter if I try to send it from my phone over wi-fi, or data, from my Wi-Fi tablet, or through my browser on the computer. It shows the messages are being sent, but the recipient never receives them. If I open a new texting app, it shows all MMS messages were not sent. Inexcusable for a paid app!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrew “Andy” Doll,"This app is great! Saves your message history in case you lose or break your phone. Can text from anywhere, including your PC! Edit: Down two stars. With my S22 Ultra I can no longer send MMS or Pictures to anyone with an iPhone. I have changed APN Settings, Network settings and so much more with no luck. Going to have to find a better app until this gets fixed. No tutorial has worked to fix this issue.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Igor Steel,"Original developer sold the app. Since then, I've been unable to sync, and support hasn't helped at all. They've repeatedly sent me the same (useless) instructions apparently without looking at notes from the last support rep. They've repeatedly delayed responding for weeks at a time, and they have completely failed to help. If I could, I'd ask for my money back. This app no longer works as advertised, and support seems to be helpless. Update: Contacted them again, but no answer...",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,mAtom “Ash” West,"I love the Pulse app and want to give it 5 stars but there are issues that prevent that. Pros: I L♡VE being able to name group threads, set custom tones and the backup. (Paid version.) Cons: Randomly it will send any photos that didn't go through originally all at once and they don't show on my end. My husband (paid account, same service, better phone) randomly can't send gifs, while I can. The ""solutions"" are ridiculous and don't prevent reoccurrances. Unistall/ reinstall, etc... 🤦🏼‍♀️",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christian Valerio,"My phone randomly started sending old photos and text to people I don't even talk to anymore. I received about 20 messages from different people saying that I sent them texts/photos without any context. The worst part is I can't see anything that I sent, I only get their responses. So in reality, more text were sent out, but only a small amount of people responded back. It took some time to realize that these were all old text they re-received. Insane! I will no longer be using this app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Francisco Ochoa,The app was ok but there were persistent issues when sending and receiving messages. The final straw came in September when I got signed out of my devices and could not log back in with the password I've always used. There's no way to reset your password without deleting your current account. I sent a request several times to proceed with the account reset and never got the email to finish the process. Could it be that this company got hacked? Don't waste your time with this app!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,RimWulf,Edit: the one the I have a problem with are app they they don't answer. Granted the removal of the wear OS app seems to be Google's doing but would it be so bad to get an update. I'm considering buying a another lifetime sub but considered the price hike and the lack of correspondence $99 is a bit steep. Does what it's supposed to. Glad they finally made it usable workout setting it as texting app so I can read messages that I received in the other device?s number.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark M.,"Cons: web only had a history going back 11 days, therefore searching past texts was practically useless. Support takes too long to respond. 2 days was the fastest turnaround & so far I'm up to 4 days on current issues. Not all contacts show up on web when I type in their name to send text. Dates not shown when scrolling thru contacts of past texts on web. Dates only show when you're in a specific text. List of conversations are on a separate page from somebody you are texting (contact flipping).",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,JM Braz,"enough with the rate our app even after posting a rating and also the upgrade notification! if I thought upgrading was worthwhile I would have done it long ago. I get messages on multiple devices already for free through another service. this app has no multi-select capability to delete images inside a thread, it has no ability to block a series of numbers (like # contains or # begins with) both have to be done 1 at a time ..a real P.I.T.A!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stuart Gelin,"The UI is excellent and it definitely has some nice features, but I do wish there were some more features like spam blocking, RCS, and the ""iphone react > emoji"" thing. Also, the web app doesn't seem to be maintained. It works sometimes, but it doesn't sync well.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Greenstein,I have had the paid version this app for a few years and it was great until recently. Bugs caused to crash. Reinstalled and lost many saved cherished messages. The value prop of the pro is that it restores old messages. It did not here. Customer service takes days to reply and so far has been of no use. Where are the backups on the server that should fix this? Update: oct 4 - no resolution or help Oct 10 - no resolution or help,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cherie,"Thank goodness for the free trial. I got this specifically for the auto reply feature since it said that I could choose a keyword to send an auto reply. This would be a huge boon for my work, so I'm not bogged down answering the same questions again and again. Only it didn't work at all despite multiple tries, and all my outgoing messages are starting with 0#. Like ""0# Hey can I call you later"" etc. I would've loved the functionality they promised but unfortunately they're not delivering.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Evitaa Evans,"What happened? I've used Pulse for 2 years. I can't access anything anymore. Settings, archived messages. Nothing. ETA. I did fix it. I had to text myself to access everything. Then my correct phone number showed and I was able to see archived messages and access settings. I don't know why a completely different phone number locked it, but it did. Sorry, I can't trust an app that's not dependable. And no, I will not go in and report this bug. You get one chance. You lost it. Bye.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Stephen,"Z fold 4: Great app, I've been using it for years. But it would absolutely be nice to have a split view like Google messaging for fold devices (for a non-rotated display). Also *please* show the side scroll position for message windows because it's invisible on my fold 4 and I keep accidentally hitting it, randomly scrolling though the message history.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,PM Mc,Since 29 Aug update it doesn't notify on phone and galaxy watch with new texts. It also constantly crashes on phone. No I didn't change settings or add new apps. This update currently makes it worthless. Don't get until they fix it. Also you can note their reply to all of us is the same canned load of bull. It IS the most recent update and that's the problem!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Violet Heise,"I've been using this as my text app for a long time now. It works really well, and the occasional bugs I get are minor and resolve quickly/easily. I really like the customization. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to get read receipts from other Pixel users.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim Clay,"Used to be a great app, but since getting new phones in February, (S21+'s) have been having random issues with mms messages. We thought it was our carrier, but after troubleshooting for a few hours tonight, I tried the default samsung messages app and things started working. We had a ton of expired messages from ""unknown"" of and a couple that weren't expired. Clicked on them and they were my test images that hadn't gone through on Pulse. Missed a lot of messages the last several months.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Fiona Scales,"I've used this app for years now and been very happy up until the most recent update. Like many others, I'm no longer receiving notifications. I checked settings, tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and even contacted support. They said they are aware of the issue and working on an update. That was 2 days ago. Really getting annoyed at not being able to receive a notification when I get a text! Please fix soon!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,J Mckinnon,"ERRORS Nice outlay, but I've been told before that I've missed texts / replies that weren't sent or received. The app looks and feels nice. However, I won't be using again after switching to my stock messaging app and seeing a ridiculous amount of ""failed to send"" flags next to texts over the past three to five months, that all showed as ""sent"" in pulse. * Yes the app is always updated, I have 5g service, and gigabit internet at home. This is a software issue, not connectivity.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Courteney Schenck,"This was a great app until about a week ago, first messages wouldn't send. Did all the tech things, still didn't work. Developer says they are working through issues. Ended up getting a new phone (not bc of this), messages now send and receive but don't notify. No win here. I hope one day they'll fix it as I've been using it for several years but doesn't seem like much hope right now.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Levana Blankenship,"This app was great up until recently... With the latest update, the ability to change the SIM within the app was removed. The site doesn't even reflect the change. I utilized this application for my business with my dual SIM to avoid having to give out my personal number to clients. It can't even do that anymore so I'll be disputing the charge on my card for the premium version of this app as it no longer does what it advertised.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steven Smith,"NO LONGER FREE TO USE! 😡 Used this app for more than two years but now uninstalling. After the most recent update, I stopped receiving notifications for text messages and didn't know why. I've seen others have the same issues. Recently uninstalled and reinstalled to try and fix the issue and the app is now forcing me to sign up for a payment plan to continue using it. It is no longer free. Thanks but bye!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris Edgar,"Frequent login/credential problems. Every couple months, it locks me out and says my subscription has expired. Log back in, go through captcha a few times, look up how to fix it, and a half hour of frustration later you're good again. Sorry, guys, this is not what I am willing to pay for. This is absolutely unacceptable behavior for a paid subscription app. It's been, what, a year (for me anyway), and you haven't fixed this. Don't ask me to refresh subscription. YOU fix it. Unsubscribed.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,jynn,i love the archive feature of this app. also that when you Blocklist someone there's not a little side folder that holds their messages. also love the scheduling feature. it helps to be able to schedule a message to be sent at a future date (birthdays for instance) that not only keeps you from having to remember but also reminds you once it's sent. great app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A. C.,"Got lifetime service, does what I need seamlessly, and makes message backup over new phone with new number from old phone a breeze. Developer was really quick to respond to email and questions- awesome. Get this- you wont be dissapointed. Edit- nothing has changed my opinion. Its honestly one of the best apps I've used. I've never had any issues with it. Edit Aug 2022- Still flawless, the ONLY app I've never had any issues with, to this day. Absolutely simple but works perfectly",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kathy Kerber Music,Sep 2 update....nope....keeps crashing on my phone which keeps telling me there is a bug in the app. Uninstalled reinstalled same problem. Conversations missing some texts. Honestly it is a buggy mess that keeps loading ads for its subscription service LOL bought it once before. Had nothing but problems. Tried it again last month (free version cuz I have a different google account now) I will never pay for an unreliable texting app. I depend on clear and timely communication. Grade: F,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Elizabeth Roman,It's a great app. I always download this onto all my phones and use it versus the original messaging system it has. It allows you to schedule messages and private message along with normal texting abilities. Updates always cause bugs and now I'm not getting notifications and the app randomly crashes and doesn't reopen.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sean Sturgill,"I used to love this app. Today, I was having issues where it was not sending me notifications of texts. I reinstalled it and my entire contact list started receiving all sorts of random photos! It's awful! I have no idea where the pics are coming from. They aren't my photos. This is terrible. Fix it!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,skippy flatrock,Really good app but since I updated the app it crashes every 10 seconds to where it is nearly impossible to send texts. Ever since the update I am not able to send texts with eas which I have been able to for years. I am using a Razer phone 2. This is the only app that keeps crashing on my phone.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sean Chase,"This app was great until 9/1/22 now it crashes when a new text comes in whether it's open or not so there's no notification, visual or sound, to alert me to a new text. It'll crash while I'm reading a text as well. I've tried clearing the cache, rebooting my phone, reinstalling the app and nothing works, time to find a new messenger app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Roy,"Update: This app has recently become a buggy mess. I don't know what the developer is thinking. A few months ago, I completely lost the ability to send messages with the app. Took them two weeks to fix it and they never answered any of the emails I sent to support. Now it started to randomly turn text to hyper links, which is incredibly annoying. (words like ""I'll"", ""cares"", ""see"" all become links). The dev really needs to *test* updates before they go out.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Porter Lyman,"I'm was a big fan of this app, having a lifetime subscription. However, I found out recently that I have not been receiving a lot of texts. I thought it was a carrier issue, but after switching to another texting app I started getting them normally. PulseSMS has much going for it, but not showing texts that come in is a huge issue. That's the one thing it has to be perfect at, but has failed. Maybe I'll try again in the future. I know the app gets updates, but it'll need a LOT of love.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,F S,"Often a text is not send although it confirm that it was. Cannot send or receive photos, although I should be able to based on my plan and phone set up. Need a new app. UPDATE: I deleted the app and reinstalled it. Works like a charm. I can send photos and videos. Took me two months to find this advise but I did not. If anyone has similar problems with the app. do what I did, reinstall it. Change my rating from 1 star to 5 starts.  Thank you PULSE.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jake Weed,"*Edit* - Pulse has always been great, but sometimes it just decided not to send photos and I can't find a way to fix that issues. I always come back and try it again but this is the second time around it has the same issue.* The BEST sms app there is hands down. I've used over a dozen and this is easily the best one, with the most options and being able to seamlessly text with my tablet and computer is a giant plus.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jayce Miskel,"Edit: Newest update is screwed up on Android 13 with Pixel 6 Pro. Don't get notified. Use my phone for work and can't have that. Hopefully they fix it soon. My initial review: Great app, best messaging app I've ever used. It's simple to use, yet has very many complex features. Love the ability to sync between devices. This is probably the most used app I have.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Arnulfo Nieto,"There's been an ongoing issue, when receiving multiple pictures, the app will show duplicates of one image when there are actually different images. So, if I get two pictures one of a dog and another of a cat, the dog will show up twice. I have to exit the app just to look at the real images. Sometimes when I've updated the app sometimes messes up. I do wish the conversation bubbles could be updated.. maybe something similar to iOS bubbles. The more customization, the better!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,J.D. H.,"It's fine when it works. I have a paid subscription and just about every month, it suddenly goes blank, as if I haven't sent any messages and can't find them even when I log in on the web and can see them. I have to uninstal the app from my tablet and re-instal and wait for it to download all the messages again. It's *very* frustrating. UPDATE 6/18/22 Guys, I did contact you and now it doesn't recognize my password on the tablet, but on the phone, it's fine. SO frustrated.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Eli Cutchen,"It's a pretty decent texting app. It offers a lot of customization like colors and other aesthetics. One reason why I switched from Verizon's Messages+ app, was because it allows you to name your group messages (something you can only do when creating group messages in Messages+). Also, you can customize each group message individually. You can set a ringtone specifically to the group, rather than setting that ringtone to each individual recipient. Overall, pretty happy with it!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Corrine C,"Have been using this app for the last 6 months or so and it was great. However, all of a sudden it stopped notifying me of my messages. I tried to see if it needed updating and it didn't, so I unintstalled and reinstalled but it didn't fix the problem. Upon reinstalling it, it resent some old texts from like months ago for whatever reason. I deleted it because it's pointless to have a texting app that doesn't notify you when someone messages you.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Douglas German,"Overall it's a very good app. With minor fine-tuning, it's pleasing to the eye. The only problem I see so far is it will trash an outbound video attachment with over-compression, but an inbound video is fine, at least with using a .mov file. To override send without delay is cumbersome. All the rest I like. Feedback explained. Upped rating.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daniel Levi,"Overall this app has been great. However, recently (as in the last 2 days maybe just one) I no longer receive ANY notifications when I receive a message. I have gone through my settings in detail, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but to no avail. I don't know if this was a recent issue with the latest Android update or what, but I am considering moving elsewhere unless I can get some sort of update to what this issue is and when it will be fixed.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shiela Lee,"So far I like the app. I'm having trouble with the time stamp being off on most texts. Some by days, some by months 🤷‍♀️ I can't tell if this is something I can correct or a bug. ---> update! Developers suggestion seems to have corrected my problem with the timestamps! Thank you for your help! ---> 6/22 when I reply to group texts, individual messages are sent to everyone the author had sent the text to. Not keeping my reply in the group text thread. Where is the setting to fix that?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cam Storm,"My only issue is I can't customize the color bubble of my friends' and families' texts. Other than that, it's fantastic. Edited to add: I had an issue where my niece got ahold of my mom's phone and sent me a text with hundreds of emojis and it caused the app to stop responding when I tried to open it. I had to delete the texts in the browser app so I could text my mom again.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rich LeValley,"I downloaded this to allow me to use a tablet as my primary text device while I use it for work related tasks. It's great for that. And I like the templates feature a lot. I can see myself using that for work purposes. It is easy to understand and use, feeling the most like the native text app compared to other apps that do the same thing. I love it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ann -,"After the most recent update. The app has been extremely difficult to use. It will minimize while typing text and it dies not save the text in Draft, you have to to it all over again. Also the notifications are sporadic. You need to keep checking to see if you have a text if you are waiting for an answer. The app worked amazing up until this last update. Been dealing with this for about a week now.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gilber Garcia,"This app was great when Luke owned it. I trusted in him selling It that it would be handled well. The second to last update broke notifications while creating a mess of bugs. Random glitches like the keyboard minimizing or closing conversations, even closing the app. The kicker was that the update notes stated it was to correct some bugs. I'll continue to use it as a lifetime sub. But man I can jump ship when next I hear something bad. Better not be skimming messages",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Terence McKinney,"The app is awesome, one of the most user friendly sms apps out there. The best thing about it is being able to use it on your PC or laptop, and is well worth springing for the subscription fee for that upgrade. I had a small bit of trouble when I switched phones, and while I had to fiddle with it on my own to get it to work, the folks at Pulse were very responsive and eager to help. That's worth six stars.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jenise Frangella,Love this app! I recently uninstalled because I want to minimize apps on my phone. My phone's default messaging app just couldn't cut it and I quickly reinstalled this one! The customization options are great and I love getting a notification with a name and no content. I also have it set to easily delete or archive messages. Love this app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,ssr66902,"Message restoration beyond a certain point in time results in images not being restored (an empty placeholder being left where the images should be). Also, photos are no longer being delivered to my iPhone contacts. I've isolated the problem to Pulse as Google Messages, Google Voice, and Signal, when configured to handle SMS and MMS, all send photos without issue. (S20 Plus 5G, Android 11). This app kept me with Android, but since the new ownership has gone downhill. Next phone? iPhone!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jade Rayne de la Cruz,"I abdutely live this messaging app! I've tried 4-5 and this is the only one I've found that allows me to create folders to organize my texts! I love this function! It makes finding the right text thread much, much easier! I've grouped my messages under ""Family,"" ""Work,"" ""Friends,"" and a folder for my son with all his friends and their parents. Plus, no ads!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe,"used to be my favorite messaging app, but its unreliable and the bugs are too severe. it just caused my phone to automatically resend dozens of picture messages to people I havent spoken to in months. This happened after uninstalling, because the notifications stopped making sounds and vibrating despite being turned on in the app and phone settings. Really unacceptable errors.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jose Martinez,"This is one of the best, low cost, phone to computer texting apps I've ever used. It's simple yet very efficient. The only thing I wish it had was a notification that you were receiving a phone call and maybe it would show the number calling on a secondary device. Otherwise it's a wonderful simple app for both computer and phone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Brienza,"I have been using this app for a couple years. And loved it. The last few months however, I have an issue where I will send a picture and the recipient never receives it. I tried resending the picture while on WiFi and while cellular. Still nothing. The recipients are both Android and Apple.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A lot of features to like, but still a few bugs to work out. When composing a text, if you get interrupted by a phone call, email, or other notification, the content of the draft disappears...which is highly annoying. With the stock messages program on Android, the drafts automatically get saved (and indefinitely), but not on Pulse. I often start writing a text and come back to it later to finish, and if the app doesn't save drafts, it may not work for me.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app! The speed with which it syncs is amazing. I can have my phone with Pulse open right next to the tablet I'm working on and a text will come in and shows on both almost simultaneously. I answer from my tablet and hit send. My response goes up into the history area of the app on the tablet at the same time it pops up into the history portion of the app on my phone! This had been a concern of mine before purchasing the app outright. Other apps that sync have considerable lag and that would not work with a texting app. Lag could add great confusion as to which part of the text I was responding to on the part of whom I'm texting. Pulse has somehow made this a non-issue. Also, I forgot my backpack with my phone and tablet in it, but still got texts at work through the web. Just awesome. Thanks Pulse. I knew for a long time this should be possible, but you guys are the first ones I found that make it work flawlessly. I wish I could give 10 stars.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tia Ross,"It's better than the native messaging apps on my Android, that's for sure. However, it crashes whenever I try to send a pic via text from the gallery and it opens up multiple instances of this app. I have to go find and close them all before I can get back in. I like the app a lot though. Will keep using. Hopefully, an update will fix that minor issue. Oh, and it's not searchable like the native apps.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent app. Seems to work beautifully across all platforms. So far, extremely pleased. I have been experiencing problems with texts showing as sent... Only shows ""sending..."" without a confirmation stamp. This may be due to my inexperience with the app or something I am doing wrong. I do not know, but I cannot fault the app unless I know what is causing the problem. It may be the T-mobile network, it may be my Comcast wireless. I don't have the expertise or knowledge to know what is causing this. I appear to have good signals from both services. I have not given 5 stars because of my current difficulty and because I am unsure of future RCS compatibility (???). Again, I'm not savvy enough to even know if this is important. Otherwise, this app offers everything I have been looking for. Love the customization options and private conversations feature.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Average from the phone aspect. It didn't show the previous messages I had on the default messaging app. Although it did properly send messages, I would have given a higher rating if it showed the previous messages on Pulse. I wasn't able to delay messages but probably because I didn't know how to. Edit: I found the delaying feature. It's in advanced features. If anyone knows if the app shows previous messages, please let me know.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse Venson,"And yes.. it has the kitchen sink. This is the only SMS alternative I have found that has all the extras I was look for in one app. It actually has a couple things I didn't see a need for, but after trying, I can never go back to another SMS. The subscription price is so low you would think it is bait and switch or the app it not up to par.. And you would be wrong. The only problem I would see for some people would be the lack of customizable layout and themes. Great app!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse has become very unreliable over the last year. The app works fine on my Pixel 3, but so does the stock Android app. Trying to send and receive messages from other devices, such as my Mac or through a browser, is very unreliable. Sending messages fails 50% of the time, even though it shows the message as sent. Receiving messages fails less often, but often enough for me to lose trust in Pulse. I am looking for an alternative. The developer has been unresponsive.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Esteban Padilla,"MUCH better than the built in text function. I even paid for the lifetime version because I use the computer text function a lot. There are a few issues, though. 1) Has the tendency to resend EVERY text and photo I've sent over the past few years every now and then after a restart. This is mildly annoying at best and embarrassing at worst. 2) Doesn't really work well with smart watches and other smart devices. I tried it with a galaxy watch awhile back and was disappointed that it didn't work.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall it's a great app. It does the text, MMS, group MMS function perfectly well. Basic function for free makes it an outstanding alternative to Google messages. The one problem I have is that attaching multiple JPEG files to a MMS is too hard. I can do it sometimes, and that's too hard, and other times it won't attach multiple files at all. I may have to go back to Google just for that because of how I use text. The option to upgrade to end-to-end encrypted messages is a wonderful option but I may have to skip it.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's my favorite texting app, but there's a bug that's been driving me crazy. Pulse will never change the name of a contact, even if you change that contact's name in your phone's contact list. To change somebody's name I had to completely delete and reinstall pulse, and delete my entire message archive from the cloud. Edit: the developer responded and showed me a very simple way to fix this issue! Thanks!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This was a seemingly good alternative to the 'standard' text app but it got slower and slower until it literally appeared to grind to a halt. I have no idea whether it was because there were a lot of content in my primary threads, or perhaps because I seem to receive a lot of images in text. Whatever it was, it became totally unusable. Pity, I liked the layout and flexibility. I tried this again and LOST ALL of my text history when I got stuck in the GooApple loop of FORCING you to set a txt app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A great messaging app. A clean, simple, uncomplicated design that just works. And, it's free if you don't need syncing between devices. And, if you do need syncing, 10 dollars for life is super cheap. A lot of the complaints are tech problems that have nothing to do with the app. I almost never review anything, but felt compelled to review this app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Been using for a few months now. The concept is fantastic, but the refresh rate can be frustrating at times from the computer side (despite my gigabit connection and 2018 Macbook Pro). Roughly half the time I receive a message on my phone, Pulse wont pick it up for an hour or so. If that's fixed, it'd be my most frequently used app/desktop app. Great features on desktop - reverse order of texts, enter to send, etc., but lacking execution at this point in time.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It is good, but I wish it didn't automatically assign each conversation a color. I thought that assigning the theme color to all convos would reset it, but it didn't. Also I wish it would show the picture of the people you are chatting with next to the speech bubbles. That's especially important with group texts. I like the privacy options, though. All in all it is alright. Not yet perfect.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Pirho-omega,"The web version on chrome doesn't lose the '(1)' notification in the tab even after I've clicked and read the message. That's not a deal breaker though. Love the delay I can give texts just in case I messed up the wording it something. However... Scheduled messages didn't send correctly. I scheduled them to send each one minute following the other (900, 901, 902, etc.), but the first three sent all at once. Weird, but it's not a feature I plan on using. It's not a deal breaker.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall great app that syncs with desktop. 2 issues... 1. After sesrching for a person on mobile and then sending a text to that person, your position in main list goes to when you last sent that person a text. So you have to scroll all the way back to the top. 2. When starting a new text on desktop, it doesn't show the history of texts. So you can't see the last texts in case context is needed. Otherwise it's a great app with many useful features, such as pinning texts at the top.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love the fact I can see different ""themes"" for each person...tone and colors are super customizable for each person you text. I have a glitch here and there where it freezes so I have to exit app and then go back. Also I have to figure out how to change the keyboard apart of it because it's like default and it gives me autocorrect which I don't want. That's the reason behind my 4..maybe 4.3 stars because even though it's a darn good app, it's not 100% perfect.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,kara miranda,I love Pulse. I uninstalled it at one point trying to search for another app. But came back to this one. Then I bought the lifetime account. Afterward I discovered it doesn't sync with my laptop very well. I've tried to fix the settings over and over again an uninstall and reinstall in addition to refreshing. This does not fix the syncing problem and the ability to text all of my contacts.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse Kropf,"This SMS app is nearly perfect. The ability to pin conversations to the top of the screen is very helpful. I wish I could have both emojis and the Enter key on my keyboard at the same time. And I really like that I can mark a message as unread, but I wish it would give me a new notification when I do that. The other feature I miss has to do with deleting messages. Pulse can automatically delete messages older than a certain time. But I would rather delete them per convo when they're over 200.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app. Lots of quality of life features that are super convenient. Only three tiny issues which prevent it from being 5-star: 1. I wish the pop-up notification could display more of the incoming text, instead of just a couple lines. 2. There's a bug on both of my phones (both motorola) which causes the theme to change to white until I click on it, then it fixes itself. 3. I wish there was a semi-transparent widget theme, instead of just a solid color. Overall, these are very minor issues.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,App works sporadically. When working it's a joy to use. When it's not working it's a royal pain in the a$$. I've needed to delete and reinstall twice in the last week just trying to get it to send simple text messages. I may start looking else where. 10/23/2018 UPDATE...After some adjustments to the settings on my phone this app has begun to perform as I had hoped.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ron Spi,"Absolutely superior to the Message+ by Verizon. The app syncs immediately, allows for more personalized features and blocks unwanted text, and this is the reason I paid for the app. New features are added all the time and the developer is too busy updating the users regarding fixes. In the desktop version, attaching an image is a hit or miss. Double click on the image sometimes adds it to the message. Dec. 8, 2020 : the app now is free for all, and improved since my initial review. 4 stars.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"After having done the free trial for this one, switched over to Mood and stuck with Mood for months, and then coming back to the paid version, I can confidently say that this is the better of the two and, since they seem to be the top competitors right now, probably the best option in the store. It's streamlined, cute, and has a wide array of useful features (a web app that actually sends SMS messages and an option to delay sending for a quick proofread are standouts). Very much worth the price.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"10/2020 - I have been using this for over 2 years now. When I get a new phone, I have at times tried other texting apps, but I always return to this one. It runs the way it is supposed to, and has proven itself very reliable and very flexible over the years. I highly recommend it. 3/2019 -Wokrs the way it should, with a rich set of configuration options. Works very well on my phone, tablet, and PC, quickly syncing between the three. I have used other Sam's apps... I'm sticking with this one.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Love the app and that I can text from my computer. All the customization options are really great. Group texting is a breeze. Sharing pictures/screenshots/whateva takes just a few clicks. My single gripe is that sometimes when I get a notification from this app it takes me all the way to the top of whatever page I'm looking at. Usually not a big deal. But sometimes I'm like hella deep in an article and I'll have to find my way back. So yeah like 97% perfection. Try it out!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brenda Thompkins (Butterflydzines),"EDIT: Too many messages are not making it to me, photos sent to me aren't arriving either. It's not reliable anymore.I've been using Pulse for a long time and I love it. It's completely customizable and I especially like the option to blacklist unwanted texts; I was unable to that with my phone's default messaging app. The Private Conversation option is very handy as well. The app has always been reliable and I highly recommend.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really great app. 2 stars because randomly the contact pictures don't show. And the blacklist feature is kind of useless. You have to type in the number you want blacklisted. You should be able to just press and hold the number or numbers and select blacklist. Much better than the current method. Edit: I know you can open a conversation and select blacklist. But when it's a spam text including 20 numbers that doesn't work. I would like to be able to click a number in the list and blacklist it.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have been using the app for a few months now and LOVE IT!!! The options like pinning conversations to the top, categories and colors all make it so much easier to use and sort than other similar apps. But most of all, the ability to text from any device is great. I love it all and don't have anything bad to say at this point. I will update if that time comes... but I don't think it will. VERY WORTH THE COST OF A COUPLE OF CUPS OF COFFEE!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Isaac Cady,"I use it mostly because it has an AMOLED theme and I can choose the colors for conversations. Some other features such as delayed sending are nice. The ability to (pay extra to) access your text messages from any device is practically useless if you always have your phone with you—and who nowadays doesn't always have their phone on them? Not only that, but you have to use a web browser to access a webpage with a slow interface in order to do so.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Better than Google Messages except.for one feature. It doesn't have the ability to create audio messages. It works well with all features it does have though, which is more than I can say for Google. Unlike Google, the desktop client on my Macbook Pro works flawlessly. Every time. No glitches. No waiting for messages to connect and sync, even. Best texting app I've found so far. Would give it 5 stars if it offered audio messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have tried many of the SMS apps. Pulse is the best. Good performance. Very nice appearance out of the box, with simple, useful adjustments as needed to customize with your preferences.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I loved the app until the last couple updates. Now the conversation doesn't move up when I bring up the keyboard. I then have to back out to the conversation list and open the contract again, and then bring up the keyboard before I can see what I'm typing. I sent a bug report but just got a stock reply. I kept it for 3 weeks, but it's just too irritating on a daily basis to keep using it. I cancelled my subscription, and am looking for another app. This occurs on both the beta and stable release",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,So far I love it! One of the very few apps that works completely with my HTC U11 Unlocked (Verizon). It's so clean and I love being able to customize each conversation. Haven't tried it on another device yet but I look forward to doing that. The only thing I'm having trouble with is finding the quick settings. I want to be able go turn on and off driving mode without having to go into advanced features.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Clean, minimalist, highly functional design. Unfortunately, several key aspects keep it from becoming my new text replacement. 1. Hidden message list is out in the open. Since I sometimes pass my phone to others for business, I prefer knowing my private messages are fully hidden. 2. Autoresponder is not in the main list and must be accessed through settings. 3. Autoresponder is limited to a single one per contract, which can only be deleted and not deactivated for later reuse. If you don't need any of these specialized functions, however, this app stands as a solid choice.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Evan Mobley (amminadabz),"Loaded with all the right features and a clean modern aesthetic. Switched from Textra and I don't regret it. The online and cross platform sync is the big draw, and you can get it for a one time fee or a cheap subscription. I really hate subscribing to software, so you can guess which I chose. I recommend color-coding all the people in your group chats, but this has caused a bug in the windows app where it makes people the wrong colors.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I had grown frustrated with the Android messaging app as it constantly crashed and nailed to send messages. This app is crisper, easier to use, and allows for better messaging. if you want to use it on multiple platforms which is a huge benefit. Be prepared to pay a small premium for use on multiple platforms. I especially like how I can color code and truly customize each conversation. It's just a far superior app than what Google has put out.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Starlitzer X,"I do like the app... However, it won't send videos. I even try to send the videos straight from my gallery and it doesn't work. I've tried every way possible to send videos and nothing works. I know it's the app. I've had this app on 2 different phones, with the same problem. It shows that I sent the video, but it never shows up on the recipients phone. Once that is changed I will give 5 stars! (Android)",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is pretty much a great app. I like the fact that I can receive my texts on my tablet, and they tend to sync perfectly between my tablet and my phone. The only thing that needs some work done is sending messages. I receive them just fine on both my phone and tablet, but it can take a while sometimes to send a message. It will say ""sending"" for a good 5 minutes or so sometimes, and every once in a while, it won't send it at all but it will say that it was sent.",4

Other stock messaging apps always seem to fall short. This app is stable and easy to use. I rarely rate my apps but I felt this one deserved it. This one works great. If I had to critique it in any way I would like to see the time on my texts. I'm probably doing something wrong but sometimes I see the time of the text, sometimes I don't. But it's great overall.",5

Thank you for doing what no one else could seem to accomplish! p.s. I did disable the battery optimization.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I would have liked this app a lot except for two problems right off the bat. First off, to back up your messages, you have to pay a subscription fee. Secondly, the messaging part is almost perfect except you cannot add anyone to an ongoing group conversion. This is something I can do with my phone's own built in message app and often used. I'm uninstalling it for those two reasons. If those don't matter to you, it's a great app.",3

I really hope that these issues can get resolved soon!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sky Malone-Quigley,"Highly recommend it! I got this app to be able to customize each conversations ring tone that the new phone updates took away (which doesn't help if you need to separate business and personal texts).

Thankfully I discovered the Pulse app that not only allows me to assign custom text notification sounds, but also offers several more useful features.",5

You won't believe how much being able to pick your own colors for the contacts instead of picking muted pre-picked color swatches is a deal-maker or deal-breaker. That said, I keep trying to use this app. However, it's lack of support for keeping message up to date with the stock sms or having a sync option is a minor almost major deal-breaker.

When I changed phones, I was able to retrieve my old messages, which was really cool. They still have to work on showing the sent messages. They only show the messages received. One really cool thing about it is that you can schedule a text, this comes in handy on days I'm super busy.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,D,"This is the best messaging app I have ever tried. They usually suck or do nothing new. But this one is different with a beautiful interface, and equiped with great features like message scheduling, private conversations, and a unread message folder for easy access. Try it! You won't be disappointed! I don't think I will download another app again.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've used this app since I got my phone 3 years ago. Absolutely love it, I've never had any issues. Love all the extra features even on the free version. The only thing it's missing is the ability to change contact wallpapers. I use whatsapp when I'm in a no service area and really like that feature. Overall the only two features that would make this have everything you could possibly need. It's wallpaper and the ability to use it via wifi when in no service areas, if that's possible.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,mike rhoades,"I love this app. I have the paid version. It's nice to never worry about losing my texts if I have to replace my phone. Also super handy to be able to log in from any device. I've had the app for years now and honestly it's indespesible to me at this point. All my contacts are color coded, I use the folder organizing feature, it's amazing. And, to top it all off, the UI is beautiful and very easy to use. Best texting app out there.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,JoJoSinger,"Great app with great features such as scheduled text messaging. This is an amazing feature that allows you to text a contact and schedule when you want it sent. However, since the last update, group conversation names keep changing to default ones from contacts and I'm unable to show the contact's picture. I've used this app for almost two years and , with exception of the two issues, have experienced no other problems.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brooke Pestano,"Best texting app! All the features you wanted and didn't realize you needed. After trying just about every Android sms app out there, I finally found exactly what I needed! All your messages backed up (w/a minimal update fee), appearance is totally customizable, open to suggestions, great one on one support! The first one that after a year still hasn't had a bug. I will not look any further!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app! I enjoy the way the messages sort out by date and each messaging chat can be a different color. I appreciate marking messages as unread to come back to them later, and I'm glad I can schedule messages in advance. Just about the only thing I can't do is send or receive ""remarks"" on messages (👍🏼 a message, ❤️ a message, ❓ a message, etc.), but most Android texting apps can't do that (I've only ever found one app that can). So this app works very well, and I'm certainly enjoying it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bethany Miller,"Bright colored visibility is good, and it is nice to access from other devices. The message window that is being typed in stays low on my screen, and if more than a few words are used i can not continue to see what I am typing. It will not scroll up to make a larger type-in box. Is that caused by my phone or by Pulse? I have had a couple picture messages not come through after a sender claimed to have tried several times to resend. May have been error on their end.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe B,"Syncs well across devices. I've been using Verizon Messages+, but it doesn't sync reliably, so I have to manually delete. Pulse gets this right. I'd like to see more conversation options. Colors are assigned in group messages, but sometimes the same color to more than one participant. The sender's name isn't always underneath each message, so unique colors would be helpful. I paid for the permanent version, which I seldom do with apps; that was hasty, but I want the cross platform functionalit.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Like it way more than any other messaging app I've tried so far and the list goes beyond 10. I would like one crucial setting added to the swipe actions, specifically call. Was surprised it wasn't already a feature. It was probably my most used on others. I wouldn't mind being able to change the background of the texts screen to any picture you have downloaded and be able to change the opacity of it. Some the others I tried you could do this but didn't like their overall functionality like pulse",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Amy Charpie,No one can get photos I send and the file limit to send videos seems non existent. I have to resort to using Facebook to message so I'll have to get a new sms app soon! UPDATE: I've contacted customer service and I did literally everything they said. Tried for months. Most people can not receive any picture messages from me at all. There's nothing more that can be done except to finally go back to my default message +Verizon app. I never had any trouble with it.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"What I like about the app is that it is able to monitor SMS text messages on a non-phone tablet. Unfortunately, probably because tablets aren't supposed to send SMS messages, I can't send. Unfortunately, I'm not able to rate the app to it's fullest. I've given it an ""ok"" rating because it does more than what most expected it would do, and has given me at least the ability to receive two-factor texts to my tablet without having to have my cell phone handy.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aline Knoles,"For the most part it does what I need it to do for group texting. My only issue, and I find it very frustrating, is when I'm in the middle of typing a text and I tilt my arm just enough that it rotates my screen, everything I just typed disappears. Then I have to retype everything all over again. I shouldn't have to turn off screen rotation on my phone just for an app to not wipe my text in progress away. If this problem was fixed, it'd be great! I'd love to know if there is a fix.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,argon B,"it would be perfect if it weren't for a few annoying bugs dragging it down. for starters, i can't send gifs. the person receiving it will only get the first frame. secondly, i can't send text and a picture in the same message. if i do that, only the text sends, and the receiver never gets the picture, or even an indication there was a picture. finally, messages sometimes will still say ""sending"" even after they've been sent. if these were fixed, this app would be practically perfect.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It's so annoying whenever I receive a large body of text that not only is broken up instead of sending as one message, all of the messages are out of order and I have to play the guessing game as to which message comes next. I even changed the settings in the app, which still didn't fix it. Uninstalling. **EDIT: The developer says any third party app would display text messages that way, which is a lie. I've had other apps display them correctly. Just say that your app can't do that. 😒",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cassio Miranda,"Update on 3.19.22: After updating my phone and begin using swipe to return to the previous page, I don't like the app as much. The left swipe brings a list of menus. I think this should be moved to the top or bottom on the next update. By the way, I think it is time for an update. *********** Fantastic app. I have the paid version. Very clean interface with tons of features including blocking spam.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jobelly Welly,"It's a good app. It has a lot of useful features. I would've loved to make it my default messaging app except it seemed like it didn't store all my previous conversations upon installing it, because I couldn't search for messages that were over 10 days old. Also it would have been nice to be able to make the chat boxes smaller while keeping the font size the same, or at least being able to minimize the space between messages. I think that gives it a cleaner look. Had to uninstall but good app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Barb Seeling,I replaced the sms app that came with my phone with Pulse mainly because the original app didn't support a repeat notification. I like to set sms to repeat the notification sound every 5 minutes to be sure I don't miss a message. Pulse allows me to do that and choose downloaded notification sounds. It allows many features that I find pretty easy to use. I'm not tech savvy but I do like options and Pulse has worked well for me. I've had no issues at all!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Excellent with the premium version for being able to access and use messaging also on my computer. I have often wanted to move attached images to my computer, and this makes it easy. The only issue I ran into was that it failed to import all messages from my previous default messaging app. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it, this time successfully. It includes a long list of features that I like, including soldering and archiving. The developers are very responsive.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Maybe there's a setting I'm missing, but when receiving MMS I don't get any sort of notification that says ""picture message"" or even a pop-up and sometimes it even brings up an old notification from a different conversation. Notifications are sometimes inconsistent and rather than a pop-up, i just see the status bar indicator. Otherwise this app is fantastic!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I thought this would be a great replacement for Google's Messages (after they screwed it up with updates), but I can't figure out how to add a subject. I have to have this to send to iPhones, as they will chop a message into 10 parts without it. Ok.. I'll take your word for it as to the MMS, but I forward pics and texts all the time. I don't see a ""forward"" arrow pop up when I select a text. I only see ""share"" which means I have to select Pulse from a list of apps, then select the recipient...",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Amazing customization options, excellent control over the conversation view. Loses one star though due to a bug related to swiping away messages to delete or archive, where the action doesn't always get committed. Made developer aware of the issue but he did not seem interested in fixing it immediately. But to me, it's a high priority issue.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Curie,I've been using it for about a week. I really like the swipe to delete option and can't understand why Google give that option with their text messenger. The one thing I do miss is the ability to Auto copy when sites send you a text I need that a lot for logging into certain websites as a backup security. Google's text messaging ask you do you want to copy the text then you just paste it in instead of going back and forth. Would really like to see that option.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Pecora,I am really enjoying using this app. It works well and has great pro features. I find it useful for my business. I do photography and I can easily respond to my clients text messages from my computer. This is super handy when I have a lot of photo editing work to do and don't want to take time away to check my phone. I also make good use of the search within conversation when I need to recall details shared with my by my clients.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've always used apps from Klinker, all the way back to the sliding sms days. I even used to be a beta tester for many of them, it's just rather pointless for me to be one now. Smooth, fast, and beautiful. I just wish it had the ability to change the background to a custom picture, although I suppose that's a rather childish feature lol.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great texting app. Only thing I couldn't figure out how to do if it can do it, is skip the delayed send so that if you're OK with the text, you have the option to send it right away. Other than that, I like this SMS app as my daily driver. Also I don't see where you can search a specific conversation instead of searching all your messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jochebed Garcia,My current favorite SMS app. I have been swapping through SMS apps and this is number 3. It's easy to use and the UI is easy enough to navigate. Very customizable if you are into that stuff I like customization but there is more than I need here. I like are when I receive links to news articles or youtube videos there is a little preview which I find awesome. There is an option to pay for SMS access via computer/tablets. I haven't tried it but a nice added feature.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Diane Roberts,"I've been using this app for almost 2 years now. Occasionally I've tried other messaging apps, but this one still has features I like that other apps don't have. Lately I've been having a lot issues with sending pics and gifs (MMS messages with only text are sending like normal) to other Android phones as well as iPhones. I've tried clearing the app's cache, cleared the app's data and reset the app, deleted the cache from each and every app on my phone, and the phone's cache. Nothing has helped!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pulse is definitely my favorite sms app on the play store. I have used 4 different sms apps (including pulse) and i always found myself coming back to pulse. The interface is great. The customization is nice and not too involved. The ability to send texts from other devices is the best feature in my opinion. Overall, I am more than satisfied with this app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far this is the best messenger app I've found. I do have a few small complaints, though. Feature wise, it's missing a search function. Two bugs I've discovered are that it doesn't update contact names in group chats when you add contacts to your phone, and sometimes it will continue to say a message is sending even after the recipient has received it and responded. The color feature can get somewhat difficult because it makes you assign colors to a chat instead of contacts. This means that in group chats, the contacts can not be assigned specific colors and do not match to their individual conversations colors. Still, with Google's messenger removing any ability to choose colors, this is likely the best messenger app on the market.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Wayne Shelton Sr.,"Love the ability to text from a browser when I'm unable to have my phone which is most of the time. Love that you can color code your contacts ina group chat but they never keep their color, the colors always changing and that's frustrating. Now during the holidays, I am not receiving group photos. Not sure why, but feeling left out when family is commenting on a photo and I'm in the blind. Oh by the way, I paid for the lifetime subscription, because I thought it was the best option available.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Wanted a message app that worked well on a PC desktop. It does. With my Chomebook, I install the app and it works too, of course. I like the quick key to be able to toggle on and off the ""drive mode"", the ability to create folders and assign certain contacts to ""private conversations"" requiring the password (or fingerprint) to access. Simple and clean interface with enough customization options for my taste. Two things I really like: the web/pc interface works really well and the quick key is customizable to allow you to write anything like an ""out of office"" message letting people who text you know you're not available to text back. Great app. Thank you.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I'm really liking this. I can use SMS across all my devices with my main phone number and it works great. It is much more reliable than Hangouts and also looks nicer with more customization. Hangouts is free, but I was missing some notificatons, so I dumped it. Pulse does cost $6 per year ($11 for a lifetime license) to use across multiple platforms, but at least it works reliably. I'm sold! It'd free if used only on your phone.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cameron Gilbert,"Been using this app for a while and mostly love it. I picked it for its web/PC ability which works well most of the time and makes it so convenient to text. I'd give 4.5 if I could, only because the web service does have frequent hiccups where it doesn't sync in real time, and because the contact update has always been an issue, with some numbers still showing the phone numbers instead of the contact name. But overall very happy with it!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The app works great in my Android, but seriously fails on BOTH of my Windows 10 machines. Have been in contact with support multiple times, regarding issues where the windows app freezes, and support has not found any solution, and then proceeded to ignore me. It's a shame, because I paid full price for two licenses for the app... one for me and one for my husband. The whole reason I bought it was specifically for cross platform communication.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryan Pocock,I love the app. I love being able to schedule texts. I love being able to get my texts on all my devices including tablet and desktop. Problem is that MMS stopped sending out. So group texts or media (photos) won't send. This appears to be related to the Sprint Tmobile merger. But it is also an app issue. My other messaging apps work (most of the time). Pulse does not. So I have to switch back and forth. Pulse support simply pointed to FAQs and said too busy to help. Not OK for PAID app.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rick Saletta,"I like some of the features they included in the pulse app. Unfortunately, the app is completely unreliable. I send messages from my phone and they don't reach friends and family. The desktop interface is convenient but if you respond to a message on the phone, the response is not visible in the browser version so again, you don't receive all the messages which makes it completely useless. Very disappointing. NO, I do not have time to quality test your app. Do it yourself.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dustin G.,"Overall, it's not bad. The issues I had were the persistent offers to use the paid desktop service, the apparent lack of an ability to lock individual messages (which is handy when you want to delete the contents of a conversation but leave a message to hold the conversation ready), the scheduled message system is clunky, and that my pictures stopped sending at one point and didn't resolve. Maybe those aren't issues for you. In the end, I decided to return to my previous app of choice.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love that I can transfer my conversations to a new phone when needed. I paid for the upgraded version to so and it's great. The flexibility is outstanding though and I'm still learning what it can do a couple of years later. When you swipe a conversation, it archives it so that if you accidentally swiped one you didn't mean to, you can recover it. Of course, if you want to permanently erase it, you can do that from the archived screen. All in all, I thoroughly enjoy it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Xu,Can you add the capability of blocking the sender from a group message. Recently have many spam messages like that and there's no easy way to block them from within Pulse. The popup window turns out to be a feature for Samsung phone. It just somehow no longer works with pulse as it used to. The developer returned my email really quick. Highly appreciated.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrew Edmiston,Love being able to text from my computer! Mac App has a few hiccups but may be because I'm on an older OS. I like the option to view unread messages by themselves. It would be nice to have the option to still show the notification badge icons even after swiping the unread messages from the notification center. Not sure if that's possible on Samsung or not.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frank Bertucci,Works consistently well across all my devices which is really what I was aiming for. There are some limitations in file size but otherwise no issues and it's super fast. UI looks great and is easy to use. Hope they can keep developing new features as time goes on. For example linking to the call app for calling from a message would be great!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,James Lakko,"The messings is awesome, good customization options. Wish I could add a background to a conversation though. Love that you can sync with other devices. The syncing is not perfect, especially wish there was a dedicated iPad app on the app store, but I will get around to installing the workaround iPhone app. Also the Wear OS app doesn't seem to use Bluetooth paired with my phone, it seems to need WiFi.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bruce R,"Easy to use. Free of bugs. Works well with all of the many included features! When my phone recently died, all of my messages which had been saved in the cloud automatically transferred to my new phone when I installed the app and signed in to my Pulse account. Keeps getting better with each update! I moved to a new phone and new Android 10 operating system. The app works well and having the app made the transition very easy.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robrit Johnson,"I enjoy it for basics, like texting. Pictures, GIFs, and any media are a total crapshoot and tend not to work, even on a solid connection. Additionally, I use my car Bluetooth feature when driving so I don't endanger others, and this app does not appear to work with it. My phone's messaging app would receive messages and notify me, and then read them aloud, this app supposedly has a Driving Mode, but it does not notify me or work with my Read Aloud feature. Overall, not bad. But not great.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Toomey,"I've literally tried dozens of texting apps. This is the best, period. Mute a conversation, instead of a specific contact, block by phrase filters to limit spam texts, individual contact notification options, sync across devices, and lots more. I've been using the paid version for 2.5 years now. It's consistent and reliable. I don't understand the recent bad reviews, I've had no such glitches. I love this app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Pam Kilmer,So far I love it! I have been searching for a long time to have a messaging app that connects with my phone and tablet. Finally found one and the price was great. 🙂 I still love the app except when someone sends me a video it is horrible . Anyone know why this is? I might have to get rid of it and find another app that works for videos . ☹ My 2nd review: Have been using it since May of last year. Have been having one issue but Pulse is working with me to get it figured out. 🙂 Great app. 👍,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I find this app very useful. I have several communication devices and this app gives me the ability to see my sms messages across several devices. Allowing me the opportunity to be more efficient and organized with my responses. Only minor issues I encountered so far is that, when I respond to sms via phone, Pulse displays both numbers in text. Also somethings it doesn't mirror texts across all the devices. Even so, I would recommend it as a useful tool especially for the busy people.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Lean & Mean. Just dropped android messages, which is bloated at 90MB. Pulse on the other hand isn't and it's fast too. So far, so good. Yeah android is missing stuff. Pulse can send a quick message from notification drop down. Or hold the widget for a couple of seconds, and the option to send appears. Very helpful for work when things are hectic. We'll see. 111019, Sunday, 0556: great, great app. for work I need to attach photos (less than 300kb) fast, which pulse permits me to do.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a great messaging app full of all kinds of features I didn't even know I was missing. Very user friendly, customizable and unique.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim P,"It's great to be able to text with all my devices, including my desktop. I'd give it 5 stars but my pulse crashes every day or 2 on Samsung Galaxy pad and I have to reopen it. Also, for some reason when I try to attach a file I'm not given the ability to attach a real 'file', only pictures, emojis, etc. Not terrible but a small pain. Overall, great app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Amazing SMS app. I initially downloaded it because the default Samsung app was terribly slow. Pulse is superior to any other SMS app I've used over the years due to it's customizability. You can schedule texts, delay texts, group message, and mute conversations. My only criticism so far is the calling feature. Sometimes when I want to call the person I'm texting, it will call a different person in my contacts, not the person I intended to call. I highly recommend this app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jason Bull,"This has been my text app of choice for a few years, and I've since paid for the full version. I first downloaded it after looking for an app capable of scheduling messages to be sent on specific days and times. Other features have since appealed to me above other apps such as customizable conversation tools, the option to mark messages as ""unread"", pin favorite conversations, view unread messages only, and more. I also no longer have to use a separate app to back up my messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pros: Great app, fun, and useful. Lots of customisation. Cons: Would REALLY like to get rid of ""Today"" ""This Week"", etc... so all messages are together and not separated. It can be a bit buggy at times. I've had issues with conversations staying in 'Private Conversation' folder and randomly moving themselves back to regular convo folder. I tired deleting my account to make sure convos would delete off server and when I restored with same email/pass my past sms could be restored. May not have waited long enough though, not sure. Sometimes when desktop app starts on startup the window is blank white screen. Have to restart app. Other thoughts: Top left box is empty (name/phone number) would like to put an avatar or something. Overall: This is prob the best sms application for android/Windows users! I previously bring up some issues but in reality the issues haven't been too terrible to deal with. Also, Luke seems to update the app quite frequently and fixes things along the way as well as adding new features. This application is truly the way to go!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I downloaded the app because the built in text messaging in my phone was just bland. This app allows you to customize colors giving it a warmer feeling when you open it. Plus, I find it to be easier to use. I rarely have problems with this app, and Ive have had it for over a year. The only issue I have ever had with it was sending messages, but that is more than likely my service than this app. Last but not least, it does not have ads attached to it! I would definitely recommend it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app gives you the functionality the OEM apps don't, the ability to change font and size, color, etc. I could not even read my text messages on my new phone because of the color scheme and I couldn't change it. If you want a text messaging app that puts you in control, with plenty of features, yet simple to use, Pulse is the way to go.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Derrick,"STAY AWAY! It was great, until it wasn't. I spent $65 on the lifetime subscription of the Text/SMS app. I loved the ability to text people from my computer, tablet, and phone seamlessly. Then it wasn't great. People started to not recieve text/multimedia text. Then I didn't receive their text. Then now it's just a luck of the draw if I can communicate with my friends, family, and coworkers. I regret spending so much money on this app and wish I could have a refund.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Simple, affordable, support this dev! I wish it was a tiny bit more customizable and the fluidity leaves something to be desired, but overall you can't beat this app! Pictures do not restore from an old backup but that's ok. I use the desktop app and it's wonderful (the one time fee blows any competitors out of the water).",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,LayZGames,"Amazing, no problems whatsoever. Amazing interface with easy to learn tools. Edit: I have been having issues with the quality of pictures that I receive. Yes, I have changed the max size to the max option, still fuzzy. Would appreciate it if you guys could look into that, thx and keep up the good work.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jack Murphy,"Needs more features. Some way of skirting the issue of getting messages from iPhone users saying ""John loved ""[your message]"""" would be awesome if it's possible. Pulse suffers severely from a message duplication bug, where two consecutive messages say the same thing until the conversation is refreshed. If you've experienced it you'll know it is different from receiving a double text from your carrier, the bug is clearly an issue with Pulse. I've used Pulse for years and highly recommend it.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,So far so good. I like that I can schedule texts to be sent at certain times when I know I will be too busy to remember. I even schedule texts I send to myself for reminders. Update: App will tell me I have a text message and when I go to look there isn't anything new. Also I really like having the option to lock an important message to help prevent it from accidentally deleting but this app don't have that. So you only get 3 stars.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app has great features, but group texts, links, and pictures rarely get sent or recieved. As soon as I downloaded a new app this was fixed. I bought the lifetime subscription as well. This was a waste of money as it only gave me a few more features and I will be uninstalling the app do to the previously mentioned issues anyway. These issues need to be fixed.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Almost perfect! I picked an Android partially for the fun experience. I have all my conversations color coded in messages. Then the update, and suddenly I'm back to a boring, sometimes confusing messaging app that reminded me too much of iMessage. I was thrilled to find pulse. The web app works wonderfully. I love the folder/structure in the app. I can even pick accent colors! 😍 Basically, I have to thank Google for forcing me into a much better user experience with Pulse SMS than I've ever had. Two MINOR things, unless it's user error on my part: would love pics in group texts next to text bubbles, and love to be able to open links directly. (Seems I have to use the upper right dot menu to say open in chrome--UPDATE: TURNED browser as Luke suggested and it's working perfectly). Otherwise thanks for all the other features I didn't know I'd need!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like that conversations can be transferred to a new phone, but I'm disappointed about paying for the Text From Anywhere version. Also, I thought we could assign colors to people in group messages but it now seems to randomly assign colors each time you open the app. It's disorienting when you're looking for a message from Bob and his messages are blue one day, and now Becky's messages are blue. Consistency would be nice",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Searching does not work on the desktop version and this is where I do most of my texting so I need to search on the desktop version too.  This behavior is intentional and you can read about it by searching the word ""search"" in the help documents. It states there is no plan to change this.  I also really would like a forward to my email option like MightyText as I spend a lot of time in email and it is helpful to get copies of texts there.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Removed one star because now whole threads are not showing up in the desktop app, even though I had it open and would have liked to use it for a longer SMS conversation. The contact doesn't even show up in my contact list even though he does in the default messaging app. I really like the interface, but have been having issues receiving messages on the desktop app even though they show up in the mobile app. Haven't missed any messages, it is just weird that those messages never show up in the desktop app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,T. Stark,"I've been using this app for over a year, maybe two, a couple flaws make mediocre. I primarily selected this app for its scheduling function. Great for not forgetting someones B-day, or a message you want to send someone but not in the middle of the night. Schedule the message and 'file and forget'. With that said, as the 3 star rating represents, it's just ok. It looses points for these couple reasons. 1. If you are in a group chat, and typing a message, in certain cases (I've yet to figure out the exact circumstances), if someone in the group sends a message, the message you are typing will be erased as you type. Doesn't happen every time, but enough that's a recognized 'threat', to me. 2. Editing messages more than a couple lines long, when they are in the 'scheduled to send' folder are a royal PitA. You can't see the whole message & therefore can't easily edit the message. The poor work around is use the 'copy/cut...' function. Move one of the "","" to the location that I want to edit it. Disable the 'cut/copy' function, once at the location, and I can edit. PitA. 2B. After editing the message there are ways to leave the message, that you don't get a ""Do you want to save"" option, so you end up loosing your edits. For core sms functions this app is good enough - nothing special. The sms app that came with the previous version of Android was cleaner in it's implementation overall and with scheduling, but the scheduling function was removed for some reason with an update, so the reason for using this app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robert Brend,"Love it. Having the web app is awesome, I probably send over 50% of my texts from my computer, rather than phone. The only complaint is the contact sync to the web app. It often cannot find new contacts or cannot start a conversation with a contact that it cannot find so I end up sending the 1st message through my phone, then the sync works great. The password/fingerprint protected ""Private"" messages section is an awesome feature, too.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Laura Chalifoux,"I love this app! I use it on my phone, tablet, & Windows 10 laptop. Sending and receive texts on whatever device I'm working on is such a huge convenience. I lots of customization features, and extra conveniences like a Quick Share option for sharing content in Android without having to open the Pulse app. But the main reason I switched to Pulse is I can easily see when I receive a group text, so I'm less likely to embarrass myself with an inappropriate reply to the whole group. Excellent app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Open-source, stable, fast, customizable, with great desktop PC integration. Definitely my favorite texting app. A couple features I would like: Ability to compose long texts in a larger space such as a separate pop-up window. Also when a friend texts me from a new number the only option Pulse offers is to save a NEW contact; there is no option to UPDATE existing contact. Other text apps have had this feature for years now.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app and far superior to other texting apps, though it is not without flaws. I use it daily on both my laptop (Chrome browser) and on my cell. Makes saving/searching texts a breeze, no issue with storage, etc. Main complaint is that if you have a lot of contacts, it simply will not pull up the ones you regularly use on the web app, even after refreshing of contacts. The mobile app works fine, but for example, if I want to text Tim Alexander on the web app and start typing ""Tim A"" nothing pops up. Tried everything. If I get a text from Tim I can reply, no problem, and his name shows up, so it's obviously connected to my contacts, and it works just fine in the mobile app, but on the desktop, no funcione. Small gripe about an otherwise excellent app",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,craig watson,"While I've enjoyed using post for several years on a variety of phones but I've upgraded my phone to a Samsung ultra 20g and the app doesn't work as well as a useful mother phones will actually I should say it doesn't work well when you can try to send messages off of your PC while sending messages from the PC it's really clunky it doesn't work as great so if you're thinking of upgrading to a Samsung note 20 g I would think about it twice. update after tweaks from pulse, seems to be working fine. thank you guys.. will keep you posted if any issues.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Edwina May,"Finally! A messaging app with no ads, and sychs my android tablet w/ my phone! I tried every app avail. but none worked. For my needs, pulse is the best and worth every penny of the lifetime subscription! Costs less than 2 months worth of the others. UPDATE 4/14/21:. This app quit syncing with my phone several weeks ago!!! I've tried every setting possible and it doesn't sync, send, or receive anymore. The app is now worthless on my tablet, so I've lost my money and going to uninstall.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,cydonius99,"Very awesome SMS app. It's feature rich and highly customizable. Just the other day, I had to dust the cobwebs of the stock messaging app to turn off emergency alerts due to their unreasonable frequency and irrelevance. I have been using Pulse for so long that it felt like going back to an old house out in the country with its barebones basic atmosphere, drab interior, and lack of plumbing. Pulse is just vastly superior and has been a top 5 app for me for quite some time.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sujan Bryan,"I've tried every text app, but this is the only one that met all of my needs. I especially love the scheduled texts so I don't wake people up, the ability to mark texts as unread so I remember to respond, and the versatility of the format. The automatic response, both general and per contact, is amazing! Pulse is utterly the way to go. And all for completely free. Thank you, Pulse devs!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"ALMOST perfect. This app has everything I could want in a messaging app. Except that video and sound clips do not send, regardless of the size. I've tried to send dozens of videos and recordings to people, and they show that they've sent, but nobody gets them. Fix this and you'll have my 5 star vote",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Works fantastic so far and I love the scheduled texts. I've been using it frequently for about two weeks now. The only minor issue I've had is periodically I try to share a pic and get to the send text screen and there's no picture to send. At that point I just click the add attachment icon and it will upload the picture to the text screen just fine. Very minor issue very great app.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"No annoying ads, clean UI. :) :it would be great if the customization for colors for bubbles and conversations was easier to select. Right now it's really vague what it actually affects. Maybe have it like Mood SMS where you can pick the specific text and bubble color for you vs the other person. Other than that this app is now my preferred app for texting. Edit :quick bit of feedback. Please reduce the sensitivity on the swipe gesture for deleting threads. It is way too sensitive.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse is intuitive and reliable. When Android Messages kept crashing I switched over and haven't looked back. The only thing that kept me from rating 5 stars is that the web app contact syncing process is a little complicated and doesn't seem to always work. The vast majority of the time I haven't had any issues.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Agent Tomcat,"Update 5/24/21: this app still doesn't have the ability to save all or some images from a message at once (instead of one at a time or auto-saving everything in the background) or in fact just the ability to select multiple images, or the ability to forward an entire message including images (not just the text). These are pretty basic features of an SMS app, but hey, the devs did manage to make it take 10 minutes just to initialize and optimize the app upon installation, so that's something.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"By far my favorite SMS. Elegant and simple design that just works. Has modern features without a bunch if bloat. I like the backup and cross device capability. Only complaint I have is aesthetic. The interface constantly reassigns colors to different conversations, which can be disorienting when new conversations are introduced or the app is closed and opened again.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Very good but needs work. Too few font size settings & choices is an annoying problem. Main prob is, unlike Messages+, for new msgs, does not have a persistent pop-up notification, in the middle of the screen (over other apps as well on locked screen). Why is it that no SMS/MMS app has the ability to jump to an external text editor for writing msgs, with basic text editing features AND, above all else, uses the full screen to display the msg you are writing and has a separate font size setting.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,The Swami,"This used to be a fantastic app and service to use for texting from desktop as well as phone. Unfortunately, ever since Pulse was acquired by Maple Media and transferred over in about November 2020, they have completely messed up the app to the point it no longer functions for Desktop/Chrome Extension. I'm sure they'll reply and say 'oh that's not how this is supposed to work/etc'. no kidding. we all know that. the bottom line is it DOES NOT WORK any longer for that functionality. So if you are looking for something to send/receive texts on Pulse using your PC via Chrome Extension, read the reviews like this one and look elsewhere, because this functionality has not worked in 2 months now.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Finally! A messaging app that does that it should and functions flawlessly. You don't need internet to receive or send pictures, there are no ads, and the interface is sensibly put together with very customisable features. And you know what? An app that works this well for free makes me want to pay for it to promote it. I think I'll purchase the computer messaging, just because.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It was great to be able to backup all text messages to the cloud, switch to a new phone, and then be able to download all those conversations to a new phone. 9/23/2020 Update: Still an amazing app. The biggest convenience is being able to use the web version, that allows me to use a full desktop keyboard. Much easier to type messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Paul DuVal,"Excellent app, and a perfect Android SMS alternative to the standard Samsung SMS. Tried Google Messages and it kept crashing. Others either didn't have all the features I wanted or had too many ads. I like that the function of custom text notification tones is enabled, which is not an option with most other apps. Also like message scheduling, pinning texts from contacts, custom interfaces for different contacts, and being able to ""title"" group SMS.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love the customization, except the forced dark blue background. For real, though it's there best customization out there. This messaging app is also super fast and never crashes. I love it. One star short of perfect, mainly because the integrated camera is distorted on my Galaxy S9+. Actually, I'm gonna bump it back to 5 stars; there are a lot of really good features other apps didn't think of.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Fairly Useful I thought I'd use instead of Android's default, hoping for a step up alternative, but it's simply a basic message app. My biggest gripe is how it separates your text messages with people from your photo/media messages, splitting them so that you have two message ""sections"" with everyone you message with. Too much to keep track of. Also, not reliable with identifying phone numbers as known numbers",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I like all the options they give you to edit the style according to your preferences but I have 2 things I'd prefer in this app. First, it would be nice if the image of the individual you were texting was alongside the texts they sent you and second, it would be nice if the app uploaded *all* of the texts, not just the past week.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sebastian Coeme,"I really had high hope for this app as I love the functionality to perform over various platforms. I was very close to suggest to my employer to purchase multiple accounts so that I would be able to communicate with my team effectively. As I type this review, The web app on my pc is YET again stuck on a loading screen. On top of that the contact list does not populate correctly and I forced to create a draft on phone before I can type it on my pc. The concept is great but the quality of the software and server could use some work. I give this 1 start because it has lost my business, disappointed my expectation, complicated reset functions, lack of connectivity. 4 reasons, 4 star deduction.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've been using this app for several months now. I have enjoyed it so much that I bought a subscription for my wife's devices. It is clean, simple and works on just about everything from my PC, Chromebook, tablet, and phone. The function of being able to delay my messages is a feature I use regluarly for work and not wanting to forget to send a message or thought but not wanting to send it early in the morning or late at night. With the FCC changing the way SMS messages are thought of its time to seriously start thinking of using a non-stock messaging service and this one of the main contenders.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jeff Hall,"This app is really good and I love using it. I love how customizable it is with color schemes and rules and it is pretty dang close to Apples messages system across devices. However, I give this 4 stars because I have found several bugs/glitches using it. Those examples are: even though I have edited the contact name and saved it, it still shows the previous contact name saved. Rarely messages shoe as sent twice or show they are removed. Over all I still think this app is great to use.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,CLE Momma,"I have always loved this app and paid for it. But the amount of frustration this app gives me with photos and media.. I can't handle it anymore lol. Photos only send to my contacts about 25% of the time, majorly compressed if they do arrive. I constantly have to ask if people received a photo I sent. If you're someone who sends a lot of photos.. this app may not be for you. I do love this app, the color changing themes are great. But the function is low.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Gergetz,The main reason I use Pulse is because it has a browser-based web access to be able to send and receive text messages from my windows computer. That's massively important to me and the vast majority of apps that claim to do that stink at it. I'm only giving this three stars though because contact synchronization in the web app is unreliable. Klinker really needs to work on that. Also a minor mark against it is a wonky copy function when trying to copy text from past messages on the phone.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is more about the paid feature of sending and receiving messages on other devices. It used to be good. I used to love it, it was great getting and sending messages on/from my computer. But now, messages don't show up on the computer, the pulsesms site at times just doesn't load, and more recently, I could send a message and it won't actually send until about an hour or 2 later. And it isn't like my phone was off or anything, after I started noticing this, I would have my phone in hand, PulseSMS open, and use the web interface to send a message, and it just wouldn't send. Then an hour or more later, it would finally send. Really disappointed that I paid $10.99 for something that doesn't even work right.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've used this app for a very long time and have always loved it. However, for a few months now, some of my messages come in VERY delayed or not at all. Many times, pictures that are sent to me won't download or show up. I uninstalled Pulse for a week and used a different app and didn't experience any of those issues.

xyz.klinker.messenger,S Servin,"Update 3/2022: app has become unacceptable. Grammatical errors, adds words, randomly sends. I switched to a different app. Exceptional! I was looking for a good but simple messaging app. Pulse is great. Allows me to delay messages for a few seconds, schedule messages and use the microphone for messages. It's really good, not at all quirky, no issues or problems.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"The app is great. Very well-made. Everything is streamline and colorful and easy to use. ******The one feature I don't like about this app is..... when you delete messages in most texting apps, it delete all the messages from that person.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Danielle Ross,"EDITED: the last few weeks have been pretty buggy. Messages won't send until I clear cache and sometimes history.

It works from my desktop, multiple phones, my tablet and my watch.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"For $11 one time fee, you can't go wrong with this app. I just love it so much. It made complete sync among my Note 8, Galaxy Tab S4, and Windows PC. No delays on any devices. SMS and MMS are synced flawlessly. It also supports Korean, so that is huge plus for me. Multi-line messages displays fine. For the person who uses calls and text messages for comminication with clients just like me, this app is a must-have. Whatsapp, Kakaotalk, and Line message apps are good, but not all of my clients are using 1 app, so I have to go back and forth with 3 apps. Therefore, basic text is still the best place to communicate and store the conversasion for all of my clients. Now those conversasions are synced among all of my devices. I can't be happier. Thank you.",5

I'm on a new set of phones and have been experiencing the same issues that I had previously blamed on my old phone. I used to be very impressed, but the PC app still crashes; the Wear OS app doesn't always sync; and notifications are a disaster especially in later versions of Android. Bubble messaging issues. Might have to make my own.",3

I tried other texting apps that weren't satisfactory.  This is a great app.  I love that you can set repeating notifications, so I have uninstalled Light Flow. I would have given it 5 stars if only it had the option to insert Bitmojis into it when you press the attachment option.    Update: Changed the keyboard to GBoard and was able to use Bitmojis.   However, I realized that I could only set individual contact text notifications tones for the current conversation.  When the conversation is deleted, so is the individual text sound.  I added SMS Popup so I can permanently assign a different tone for each contact. Update: SMS Popup stopped working, so I am on the hunt for something else. I tried Mood, which was good until I realized that the individual contact alert sounds don't work when the text includes other people.

I wish there was more customization on vibrations and sounds like textra. The only thing I really hate is the search function on the web is just terrible. It can only search 75 conversations. The developer knows this and has no plans to change it. I wish there was an option to be able to search through all my messages even at the sacrifice of ""privacy"".. whatever that even means these days.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So very good. Loved the app right away and already signed for device sync. I really hope this service sticks around and continues to improve! Not sure if android allows it, but i would love if all phone calls could be handled by this app, and sync across devices as well. (Apple does this on ios and mac for example). The device sync and automatic SMS backups are amazing, and definitely worth the very low price! Many thanks to the developer!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Libby S,Update. My only complaint is the web interface that is required for use on iPad is a tiny bit better but still hard to use. Original One thing to be aware of is that this only world's on an ipad with their web application which is very clunky and slow. You can see your messages and even send one eventually but I try to avoid using it there. But on my Android it is great and it's fine on my Macbook,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I was having so much trouble with Google's messages for the web on my computer. I would have to log out and log back in after sending or receiving a message from my PC. It was frustrating, as you can imagine. After trying many things suggested, I decided to try another messaging app that offered the ability to work from my PC. As soon as I downloaded and started using Pulse, my problem was solved. I have been using it now for 5 days without a single issue. I am extremely satisfied and so grateful that I found it. It makes managing my messaging a breeze. And, the PC and phone parts of the app are beautiful. They're just a pleasure to use. I give it 5 stars!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,RJ Dunn,"Pretty good. But, I wish I could add conversations to multiple folders. And I wish the folders were one click away. My biggest annoyance though is that I can't easily send text to multiple people individually, but that this setting has to be changed in global settings. There are lots of good SMS apps, this is one of them, but none have compiled all the right features in to one. What I like: I can name group convos. It has good auto response features. It looks and runs smooth.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This ap does what it says in real time! I test it from time to time with my phone and tablet side by side and I'll send a text on the phone and BAM! It pops right up on the tablet! The same when texting from tablet or web. One improvement? It needs to be more behind the scenes when changing phones so they all stay connected. I couldn't sync messages after getting new phone, but could continue to send from all they just didn't show on the others. Very confusing until I got into the help FAQ.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is awesome. I got tired of Google Messages dropping connection with the web client constantly. Pulse is a lot more stable in that regard and has WAY more features than Google Messages. I love the scheduled messages function, and the UI in general is just great. This is the best alternative texting app I've found. Used it for 2 days and was sold, bought the lifetime license. Keep up the great work!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is a great app if you are concerned with other apps invading your privacy using the default app. I have been using it without issues or concerns. It has simple color schemes that are customizable for each contact as well as notifications. To have the ability to backup and text from another device other than your phone requires payment. I really like this feature because I am able to see messages while I work on my computer or tablet and respond to them without pulling out my phone. Very much like WhatsApp(Facebook) and Hangouts(Google), but without Big Brother watching.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,lee perez,It has everything ive wanted from several different messengers in one. This IS the most complete messenger. You can even message from a computer which is great in case you ever forget your phone somewhere. The only thing I don't like is that you can't put a picture on your conversation backgrounds. Being Android phones are all about customization I feel this is kind of important for the texting experience,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dow Wilson,"Really enjoy this app. It's perfect for having access to texts on my computer as well. The interface still needs a little work. It would be nice to be able to create groups in a contact list for single clicking availability. Texts with video seem to also be a problem for the web app, but works fine in mobile. Overall, I recommend this app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"With more and more messaging apps eclipsing sms, it is still nice to have an app that allows you to access your SMS messages through means other than your phone. I think that, for now, the fee associated with this service is still worth it and when I paid for it the feature was a game changer. Now, though, I question if it's niche is enough. At the very least, the UI is simple and beautiful and it offers something other competitors don't. Seems like a 5 star app to me.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I have had the Pulse app for several months now. I've tried other SMS applications and this is my favorite by far. I have the paid version and It syncs perfectly with my desktop and laptop. I would recommend to anyone who has a desk job that would rather type their text then use their phone. It works fine on my phone I'm just faster typing than actually texting.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Hoppy Sparkles,"Just downloaded it on a rec to go with my Samsung Watch 3. Not impressed so far but it does at least share messages. My complaints are that there isn't an icon that shows up on top of everything else in spite of allowing it to be on top and when I have a link in a text eg Petsmart or Joann, the link is broken and only goes to a page that simply says, Joann or Petsmart. There are also some other settings I would like control of but can learn to live without. After a month, I may go back to Mood.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jason Hudson,"I think it's a good app. Dislikes: I don't like the steps needed to log in if you can't remember your password. They backup everything but I would still like to be able to save everything to my own file on pc. I accidentally made 2 accounts, first was a 1year subscription, 2end lifetime subscription. Would be nice to join the 2 together. THE END",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"A superb app. The ability to define text templates and modify them after they've been selected is incredibly useful, at least to this professional driver who needs a large inventory of such reusable texts for airport pickups for different terminals, etc. First class and well worth the pittance they charge for a lifetime subscription. Would be nice to have the ability to report incoming texts as spam as one can do with the native Android texting app, but perhaps that will be added at some time.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jean Roth,"Update 1/13: More issues sending photos. Many never go through. Messages on Mac often appear as pending ""sending."" A wishlist item - I wish I could mark texts as ""liked"" etc. Just paid subscription but looking for alternative bc the photo issue is a problem. 12/20 Love being able to text across devices. However, I've been having lots of issues lately with the app not refreshing to show new messages, and photos that often don't go through. Certain media can't be sent as well.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Amazingly powerful app. Never have any performance issues, is very responsive and simplistic and is decently customizable. I bought the lifetime subscription to text from any device, and I haven't had a single issue with it. I am not regretting the purchase and I definitely see myself using this service for a long time to come!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Rush,Absolutely the best SMS app. Loaded with features and very solid. I especially like the feature that allows you to set a delay timer before the text is sent ... time to read over and catch any last second mistakes. I have mine set for 10 seconds. Also like the ability to schedule a text delivery. Great app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jesse Stevens II,#NAME?,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,•Gefroren •,"It used to run perfectly fine, but now I can't see my entire message history (for example, messages that go back to August aren't there anymore, and they stop after a few weeks. When I check on the default messenger on my phone, they're still there. Its just that pulse doesn't show my entire messaging history now for whatever reason. Hopefully this bug can be fixed, as this app works well otherwise. It doesn't duplicate my messages or bug out other than by what I described! Fix this bug please",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,BR Cope,"Great and simple texting app with loads of features and advantages. It's very user friendly and intuitive. The text conversation features for links are a great aspect. Most importantly, it is open source and private. Signing up for an account is worth it because it is very inexpensive considering the extra features. Plus, messages are automatically backed up. Love it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jon W.,"Maybe I Am Missing Something... I can't seem to find a way to set individual notification sounds for each contact. Also, the very misleading setting, Sound Effect should be called, Sent Message Sound. Even more annoying, is that sound and it is either on or off but can't be changed. The rest of the app seems pretty decent though. I like it better than Textra and Android Messages. It just needs to be a little more customizable and look a little more polished to get a 5 star rating from me.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,RYAN SIMMONS,"Paid for the year subscription from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. I got it primary so I can use windows to text and synchronize to my phone. I thought my subscription just ended and didn't give it another thought as it stopped working about a month before subscription actually ended. It would say login error saying my subscription ended. When I got charged for the next year, I contacted them on the 23rd about it. No response. So I canceled with google about 4 days later and got refunded. Thank goodness google allowed for a refund. Go an email by Pulse on the 29th that said I canceled and they could not help. I am not the only person that has complained about the login error. The windows app has a lot of glitches and does not always send the text when you hit enter and does not synchronize very well. I would give the app a 3 star, but because of slow response from the developer, it gets a 1 star.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rod Hill,"Works pretty good for the most part. Lot of features are available which increases its usability. The only issue I have is attaching multiple pictures to a text message. It may be me doing it wrong but usually when I try to tap one or more pics, before I tap the next pic, I'm back to the message.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Seth McDonald,"Love the app. But eventually started dropping the quality of videos I sent, then pictures and videos stopped sending completely. When I switched back to my old default messaging app my pics and videos went through no problem. This is a big enough problem that I have to stop using an app that's otherwise great. Hope it gets fixed.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"app works prett well most of the time on the smartphone side. First issue is that this does not support a native ipad app, something I think the website kind of misleading about when it says ipad support. Second issue is that the cloud sync has been awful for me. I have about half my messages that don't sync to the cloud and are only seen on my phone. Third issue is that if I use the google assistant to send a text, the text does not show up on pulse anywhere.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"For me this app is like the iMessage of Android. everything just works really well, including the online syncing of SMS messages. Google messages is ok for a free alternative, but it's not even close to updating messages as quickly without issues. I'm thinking about buying this but when the free version is good enough to switch.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I really like the integration. I use it on my tablet and phone. I'd really love more customization, however, especially with look and feel. I switched over from textra which I used for a long time and it was free. I payed for this awesome app for the integration but again would love customization on the level of textra. Definitely would earn 5 stars after that.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Au. Ch.,"If you have an issue with your account, don't expect support to ever contact you back. I think they want people to lose their paid features and make you re-buy their new subscription model or pay $100... Ever since it got bought out I've been having issues with the app, I don't think the original developer is working on it anymore, or anyone for that matter. You're better off using a different texting app that can support computer access. It's a shame because this was my go to SMS app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It works ok but missing some functions other apps have. It is a little clunky. I'd like to see the windows platform include a choice to have a popup remain on screen until I acknowledge it. I sometimes dont see texts until later because the notification only stays for a few seconds. As for clunky the windows app on my desktop takes forever to open and select a text.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Billy Willoughby,"I was looking for a replacement for the stock messaging app. This was the first one I thought had a chance. My biggest complaint with the stock app is the fact that it over compressed my pictures when sending via MMS, and the other Androids in my family don't do that. This one while it has a web interface, works when it wants to. It will actually tell me it sent a message, and my recipient will never get it and later when I check my phone it never shows up on my phone. I can't trust it.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Jeffries,"Better than the default texting app, but not without its own issues. Some of the integration into the OS is not ideal, but I think some of it is due to Android making it harder to integrate (send via menus in other apps, etc). Worked better on my previous phone (LG V20) but not so well on my Pixel 3A XL. Still better than the native app tho.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Really like the features. Sync between devices and backup is wonderful. Nice to talk on the desktop where I can type much quicker. And Luke Klinker is wonderful when it comes to needing help. I needed assistance a few times and got things working almost immediately. Of all the apps I use. Pulse is preferred for texting. Have had it for several years and dont plan to switch. I like the dark options the most aswell as its easier on my eyes and keeps the light away.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Missing for me is background photo customization. That's not a deal breaker, but it would make the app elite for me. I also didn't notice assigning messaging sounds for individuals. Perhaps I missed it. think this app is phenomenal. Especially how I can get texts on other devices. Allowing me to turn my phone completely off to charge sometimes is worth getting the alone. I'm extremely impressed.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Susan Paul,This is a really cool app. I like that you can schedule; it's super convenient. One area for improvement — being able to share media with a scheduled text; this hasn't worked properly for me on the free version. The images aren't included when the text is sent. Overall it useful and I would recommend it.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is amazing. Allows archiving (clearing up the inbox without actually deleting messages), which is a pretty basic feature all sms apps should have but most don't, allows scheduling of messages (including group texts). Also texting from PC for a reasonable one time fee. Only thing I would add is, on the web messaging, make a tab itself change as a notification that a new message has arrived.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Razzano Family,There are a lot of things this app can do that many others cannot. I like that you can pin important conversations. I like that there's a Web based version. I like that you can schedule conversations for a later date... but there are differences between the interfaces that I wish didn't exist. UPDATE: Much of the above still holds true and I wanted to add that contacts syncing doesn't always work which is very frustrating. I did a re-sync of my messages which then cleared all my settings!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tracker Scout,"One of the best out there. I love that I can open it on a browser on pc and share links, photos, and text, and receive text. I wish though when sharing a YouTube video that it would write the name of the song along with the image, like many messaging apps do. Is great it does show an image/thumbnail preview of video/song though. I love can pin important people to the top, and love that you can call someone quick with button above text when texting someone. One of the best SMS apps out there!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Olyver Thew,"It works very well, and is relatively customizable. You can schefule messages and archive them, block numbers or mute conversations. Also use gifs, and other various media messages to send. I do wish i could change the background in each text log or set personalized message notifications for ppl, or change the color of the message bubbles. Overall great working app, had no issues.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve Day,"RARELY rate apps, but had to in this case. This app WORKS! It works just about perfectly across all my devices. Others like this were missing the boat big time! The developer takes the time to respond to each message as welll, so you will get the best help possible from the source! GET IT! UPDATE: thank you for resolving the issue of not being able to use any web browser to access.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris topher (Computer Chris),"Fantastic app. The watch Gear OS could be faster starting up and should be better at claiming Default SMS status. But overall, very useful when juggling multiple devices. Suggestion box:  Failed messages should stand out more and have a separate notification category. One marked clearly as important or critical. Perhaps even have their own category in the side bar menu, along side the private & scheduled folder list.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Anthony Agu,"Terrible. I can't send message to more than 10 people. I bought this app so that l can send messages to large groups. I have uninstalled and installed the app. However, the problem still persist. The app has great features but in practice, the app is not working for me. I have contacted support severally for help but they have not been able to resolve the issue. What is a message app if the app can't send message.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nat,"I really like this app, but I wish there was a way to turn off thumbnails for videos I send- edit: this app isn't working properly nowadays. photos don't send properly, often not at all, and I can't switch to a different app because it causes a bug in my default messages where every photo I have ever sent to any contact RESENDS SIMULTANEOUSLY. this is a nightmare.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,MM Ahmenatu,"OMG! This app is on Fire! Download quite a few scheduling apps that had crazy ads embedded in the messages being constant with busy screens. Although it's only been 24hrs, but everything the app promised is there and more! I can actually schedule a message to emails. I like the way this app emulates my original phone texting interface and makes it easy to use within seconds. Lastly, I like the option to have messages organized by time sent! Must have app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nancy Williams,"I like Pulse EXCEPT(!) that, because it only shows the first name in a group text I have more than once accidentally sent messages to groups when I intended only to send them to individual people. This is dangerous and potentially very embarrassing. After doing that one too many times, I switched to Verizon's app, which makes it much easier to see that a text was a group text. But please fix this problem and I'll come back because otherwise I like Pulse better.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jaque Elf,"The concept is great but the application is lackluster at best. Doesn't sync consistently or accurately across devices, seems to lag often, hit or miss in sending pics or links...i started with a month to month subscription so i could have real world experience seeing how well the app performance is across multiple devices. Currently, i don't think i'll be upgrading to lifetime because it doesn't work well. I'll give it one more month to see if it improves before i cancel subscription & leave 🚶",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This is almost perfect for me as user coming from the iOS environment. Only thing missing I'd like to see is a time stamp on ALL messages sent or recieved.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Krystal Geddes,"I loved this app at first but as soon as I started paying it started messing up. I wouldn't receive messages or recipient wouldn't receive messages then it just stopped working and as soon as I open it, it closes and says ""pulse keeps stopping"" yet I continue to be charged every month even though I have explained it to the creators and asked them to cancel.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Omar Romero,I've owned this app for at least 2 years. It is simply outstanding. Great customization options. I don't bother to try any other SMS app. The ability to use it on a computer through a web browser has been invaluable. Lately every once in a while I will not be able to send pictures. The text is sent and received but not the picture. Uninstall and reinstall will work to fix the problem for a few weeks.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nicholas Ferrari,"Seems great. Not giving five stars bc it's too expensive. And if you don't pay, it shows you an annoying overlay asking you to upgrade. I don't like ads, and I don't like subscription models. The one-time purchase price is insanely high. But as an SMS app, it's awesome. Although I wish you could change the font color and the color for your own text bubbles in conversations.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rachel,"Great texting app! Very easy to use, great customization options, and I love being able to text from my computer. I do wish it didn't have the ""quick send"" feature for sending photos since it actually adds an unnecessary extra click when selecting how I want to send my photos, but that's literally my only criticism. Edit: The quick send feature for sharing photos now shows up as a separate option, must have been a Google photos/Android OS update!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brodie Gullic,"(12/8) Lifetime Membership has a bug where it does not recognize anymore. I reached out to support and they tried to resolve the issue, but they have not managed to fix the actual problem. Other than that, I love the texting application.

Fluidity and cleanliness of UI are two points of emphasis for me and my view of an application, and this one surpasses my expectations. Fantastic and responsive dev only adds to the experience. My only complaint is that I do occasionally miss MMS in this app that are otherwise received in the native app or Android Mesaages. I have tried MMS APN settings for my carrier, but to now avail. For this final point alone, the app loses a star for 4/5 overall.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Vincent N Erica Shaw,"On the both sides of the messages, there's wasted space on the Surface Duo, so it's a small column in folded mode. When in book mode or tablet, it still has the empty space, but looks on enough because it's so large a canvas spanned across 2 screens. Also, assigning messages to folders should be doable from the main screen when selecting multiple messages. As it is, it takes far too many clicks when buried under menus, over many messages.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alex Isabel,Terrible Bug. I used to love this app. Got a lifetime subscription years ago but now it just causes issues. Whenever I uninstall the app and it goes back to my default Samsung messaging app it automatically triggers text messages that get sent out to everyone without my permission. It's terrible I had to factory reset my phone to stop the texts from going out. The issue never happened until I started using Pulse SMS.

Glancing I can tell easily what I hadn't read yet. Cons: If u could create a thicker line for send delay. Its pretty thin, And I missed one with the glare. And appearance falls a tad behind Textra's I don't care about that cuz it's good still",5

Pulse SMS has a desktop component which can be used cross platforms, supposedly. I have a Surface and I recent was assigned a Macbook Air for my professor duties. Now, at least once per week, it seems I'm having to ""Refresh"" my account because the password I know I set a week ago is correct, but one or more of the desktop apps won't log in using the credentials. Because of its ""end to end"" encryption, the developer says they cannot simply provide a password reset because they use the password as the encryption key - that is not acceptable. There should be simple way of resetting the password and decrypting the messages. I don't know what it is, but others seem to make it work despite high-level security.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Steve DeBow Jr,"Used to love the app then I tried looking back at an old message that was no longer able to be loaded. Only a few months seem to load now. Not sure if this is due to an update or not. Main reason for using the app was its ability to save all messages. Basically a pay version of kik, messages disappear after they reach a certain (unknown limit)... As far as I can tell, the app is headed in a downward spiral. So buyer beware. This issue is still not resolved after numerous updates & reinstalls",1

The only complaint I can come up with is that a text will occasionally say ""sending"" on my laptop, while it had already sent on phone and watch.

xyz.klinker.messenger,W TF,"Best SMS app I've found. I originally thought that the app was choosing strange proper nouns instead of common words (""Nevis"" instead of ""before"", ""Rast"" instead of ""that"", etc.) Developers say that that's caused by the keyboard, not the app. Fortunately, you can choose to remove the prediction of words you don't want. Over all, Pulse SMS is pretty intuitive as far as sentence structure and prediction.",4

If you want to be able to send and receive text messages from your browser, tablet, or a windows app, this program is excellent. Highly recommended",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Pretty good, has a scheduled text feature which is why I use it. However, after an Android update it starts re-sending very old messages and pictures (MMS). We are currently out of the country, an android update installed and my fiance just received a dozen photos from up to a year ago. It's concerning but also at international rates. Who else is receiving old text messages? I have no idea, there is no indication it's even sending messages. It has even done this at 2 AM.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,(Edited #2): The MMS function has stopped working. Recipients are no longer receiving images sent. (Edited) It is a great app with browser support so that I can easily communicate via text without having to have my phone next to me. Customization is simple and it works well. Thank you dev for getting back to me promptly and I enjoy this app very much!,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick Santy,"2/1/2021. Ok, Finally working as designed. I'm satisfied now. Support was very helpful. Thanks guys. It is awesome to be able to send/receive texts on my phone, desktop, and tablet. Great app! Disregard the following: 1/25/2021. I wrote that more than a year ago. Now it doesn't sync, messages are delayed, msg's sent are not received. I have been trying to resolve for days. I am very disappointed, so much so, that I will change messaging apps. Goodbye Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jon Kotowski,Pretty darn good. Bordering on great. Nothing to lose a star over. I put it on my phone because it works well with my Galaxy watch. Only things that I wish it would do is let you adjust LED color notifications per person It says you can't because of a Google issue. But I have other text apps then do. I wish there were notification icons for different contacts. And the window where you type your text is smaller than I would like. Still - very good!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Haikaz Dermenjian,"Overall great app definitely worth the price tag. But, after several months of use I have to admit this is by far one of the most buggy apps I have ever owned. Web interface and phone SMS app go out of sync A LOT !!! Meaning you cat text on the web but on the phone it wont show up so then you are not sure did it go through or not? When you text same text duplicates on the phone although it's just one line. You send a text and it just does nothing but sit there. Just to much headache and sadly I need to uninstall. I think worst part was reaching out to the dev and not getting any response at all. I get he's 1 guy but these are major issues. A lot of potentical just to many bugs can't deal with it anymore. Fun while it lasted. Note 8 user. Updating previous issues I had with my Note 8 I found the issue. A) Main issue was Verizon sending texts to from Android to Apple users. B) Note 8 is just to slow and buggy to use with this app. Now I'm not sure if Verizon ever fixed the issue or not but I did open many tickets with zero response. Long story short after moving to T-Mobile and upgrading to Note 20 all my issues are resolved and I'm a happy camper. Love this APP and I use it daily! Thank you dev and sorry for bad review earlier wish I knew this when I wrote the 1st one. Cheers",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Morris,I've been having issues with my Pulse app for the past 2 days. I've had no connectivity on my phone or desktop apps for periods of time. I've also had issue with browser app at the same time to confirm it's not any of my devices. I currently have more significant issues with sending messages. Receiving messages is much more consistent then sending currently from my mobile phone. The desktop app and also the browser app and extension do not send messages at all currently. Is there something going on with the system or my account? I tried to perform an account reset and that was unsuccessful also.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Darryl Franks,"Update: Upgraded from 2 stars to 5! It turns out that my issue was with myself! My devices were not synced because I never set up my account properly. After deleting account and creating login info I'm now able to sync data between phone, tablet, and laptop. FYI; you DO NOT lose data when deleting and creating a new account. I've tried several SMS apps over the years and Pulse is the best choice!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,danred99,Best app I've found for text messaging. Discovered it when looking for a way to backup my messages outside of the standard google backup system. I only use it on my phone and not across my devices as it's designed for. Would be nice if I could easily add additional people to a group text that has already been started.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Roedema,"I'd happily used this app for about a year and a half. It's certainly one of the better options for desktop text messaging. However, I've gotten annoyed with some messages not syncing or appearing out of order. Though I'd paid $10.99 for a lifetime membership, I'm now testing out the free Your Phone desktop app and Your Phone Companion mobile app from Microsoft, as well as the web versions of Verizon Messages and Messages for Web from Google.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alvin Mast,"This is a mostly good app. There are some bugs in ""private conversations"". Sometimes it will get get ""conversation list"" and ""private conversations"" mixed up. (If you don't use that function it is irrelevant to you) Otherwise the Android version is good. The desktop version for Linux doesn't have a resizeable window so that is a downside.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Okay so I'm leaving my review at 3 stars but I'll add more specifics. The app is pretty much perfect in most areas but lacking in others. The integration between using it on your PC and on your phone is pretty much flawless. There's decent customizability and the flexibility to use it on your PC is awesome. I think the app has a lot of potential for growth. Unlike Textra, Pulse does not support iOS emojis as a customization option. As silly as it sounds, everyone knows that iOS has the best emojis. And I think if an app like Textra can incorporate them, Pulse should too. Especially given the fact that it's main goal is to emulate the ability imessage has of sending texts through your PC. Add support for this and include more customization and I'll give it 5 stars easy and buy the app outright",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Bryan Sloan,"Fantastic web message integration with no battery drain! Great that you can search for emojis by using the "":smile:"" coding. The phone app is fast, and well laid out. Feature Requests: - Roll up the menu options on the web interface to put the conversations closer to the top. - Add GIF search to the web interface. - Spread out the web layout a little bit so it expands most of the screen rather than just the center. Great work!!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Came back to Pulse from Google Messages.  Messages on the web is a great idea, but not implemented near as well as Pulse.  MotWeb was all the time disconnecting and would not be able to send/receive messages for a time.  With Pulse i have a great responsive desktop app i can use on Windows while i'm at work.  Pulse also allows me to text on devices that are not as Google friendly, such as Kindle Fires and Linux, etc.  As an SMS app on my phone, it works great and the feature and customization set are second to none.  I've especially made use of the ""delay to send"" feature.  It has allowed me to catch would-be unfortunate miss-types.  For all these features $11 is such a great value.  Look at the details of the app, everything is honest and straight-forwardly detailed for you.  No hidden costs or surprises.  In the world of the app store that is a refreshing concept.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I got this app as a stopgap when Verizon Messages+ bugged out. Pulse works just fine, though more control over the notifications would be nice (double vibrate and you can't change it?). Biggest, most looming issue - NO iOS VERSION. I understand that's not the dev's fault, but c'mon. What's the point of ""syncing between devices"" if it can't sync to half of all devices?",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Curtis Kinsler,"The design of this app is amazing. The MMS issue has been apparent for years (during the original developer days) with seemingly no resolution. Maybe it is the ""carrier not delivering"" issue, doesn't matter as it's still an issue that doesn't happen when using another app. Until that is fixed I cannot recommend, or use this app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrea Yun,"I love this app, but I can no longer send videos over text. No I used to be able to, but haven't been able to for months. I've tried to reinstall and to send small video files, but to no avail. Otherwise awesome app. Editing to minus one star because video is still unavailable to me. I might have to go to a different app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is amazing, it beats any other app I have ever used. They should honestly have some of these features as a purchased add-on, this app does absolutely everything for free and it does it better or equivalent to everyone else while combining any setting of 2020 you could want. Archiving? They got it, swipe left or right, dark theme? Defaults on my device, very easy to change and customize. For those who want privacy, well that's in here too with a secure area.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,V,"I've used this app for years and have paid for subscription. I usually love it, but recently it's been constantly crashing and seems to have issues sending and receiving MMS messages, and sometimes these issues cause my whole phone to freeze up. I'm not sure what happened, but I wish it still worked like it used to!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Good free app, and I really like that it's ad-free. But I'm having a glitch with colors randomizing in group chats. I've submitted the bug on the GitHub issue tracker, it just hasn't been fixed yet. Great app. The random colors is a bit distracting, though, so I've switched back to the app my phone came with.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far absolutely wonderful. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that I haven't had it long enough to see if there is something that annoys me. This app is very visually appealing. The lay out is wonderful; it is like your email and has a folder to archive texts. You can set up repeating reminders to people through texts. You can customize each contact, both the colors and the notification sounds. It also uses the whole screen on your phone to display messages.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Roger Asbahr,"Really a nice app. A breeze to use, backs up and rebuilds your text data easily and offers many useful features. And now it's Oct, 2021, two years later and I absolutely love this program. Has so many very useful features and it works so reliably and smoothly. Backs up and restores your texts easily, works simultaneously on multiple platforms. Give yourself a gift and go with Pulse.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cherish Grabau,"I paid for it, but I wish I hadn't. The app usually works fine on my phone - I don't receive all of my texts, but I do get most of them. However, the main reasons I bought Pulse were to read/reply to texts on my Samsung Galaxy Active watch and my iPad, and unfortunately most of the time neither of those features work. My watch receives notifications but doesn't allow me to read the text, type a reply, or send a new text. I get the notification and have to dig out my phone. The web page (Chrome browser on my iPad) doesn't let me respond to texts and only sometimes lets me read texts, and not all of them are listed. I'll keep giving it a chance, but I'm probably not installing it on my next phone.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Bascom,Great stand-alone sms app. Good dark theme. Vibrant colors. Customization is superior to Android's native sms app. 4 ⭐ for texting on other devices. I randomly need to text on a browser. Key word: randomly. 99¢/month is pricy for the one or two times I'd need this feature. $36.99 lifetime membership even more so. I've only had the app a few weeks. I'm not sure I want to spend that much money. $5.99 lifetime instead of yearly and I would have done it. For now web.whatsapp + copy/paste = success,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Really liked this app, and it didn't suffer from some performance problems I was experiencing with stock android messenger. I've since switched back, however, as I frequently run into an issue where I don't receive some group texts, leaving me with a partial conversation and no indication that I'd missed any messages (other than the conversation seeming weird). This makes it absolutely unusable for me, as I need to be able to rely on receiving all messages.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kris Wood,"I decided to purchase the ad-free version, on the recommendation of a friend. I love being able to use it on my desktop AND my phone, even at the same time. The desktop version does limit the size of pics, and if I am frequently sending pics, it starts getting a little glitchy, but I found that if I completely close the window and re-open it, it seems to get rid of the problem.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I love this app! I came across it trying to get my Samsung Active 2 watch the send and receive texts. It works really well with my phone and the watch, too. The only problem I have with it is when I've just sent a text and leave open the person I'm texting, expecting a response soon, the app does not notify me that I have an incoming text from that person. I have to remember to exit the person's name that I am communicating with in order to be notified of the next text. It's just an inconvenience that I need to get used to.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app met my three basic criteria. 1. It allows blocking of numbers and keeps a list of the blocked numbers. 2. It has a good, interactive widget that I can put on a home screen. 3. It allowd you to easily see the time each individual text was sent. As an added bonus, it is free with no adds.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick Snowman,"Great if you want to schedule messages. Also has a great feature to set a delay of several seconds, which you can adjust in settings, to avoid those OOPS! moments when you accidentally send a text before you're done editing it. Simple and intuitive. My favorite SMS had by far.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Near-perfect overall, but Pulse cannot delete an individual message from a conversation--it deletes from Pulse, but message remains in the stock app (tested on Android 7); a major flaw for a dedicated texting app that will surely be fixed soon. Would like ability to use the color wheel to choose specific Base Theme day/night colors to override the current white/blue-green static combo, and to change the color of the app icon. Uninstalled for now; will try again later. Keep up the good work, dev!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dasi,"I used to love this app. But I lost my password & used the password reset option. I've tried so many times. I never received and email to reset it. I contacted customer support & they sent me the same link. I emailed them and told them that it doesn't work. I didn't get a response except for the ""Rate your support you received."" I opened another ticket & nothing. It's frustrating. I don't want to lose my messages & block list- especially when I pay for this service. I'm disappointed with them.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Enid Gertmenian,"I had been using Pulse because it offered delayed send. Recently, I had to reinstall it to get the desktop version to work on my iPad and after doing this Pulse completely screwed up my contacts. Names are mismatched with numbers and, as had happened before, it sent random pictures and very old text messages to random people in my contacts. Extremely dissatisfied and concerned this will affect my business. Update: same HUGE problems, unhelpful bot responses from ""customer support"". AVOID APP!!",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Marsha HT,"I am just trying out this new messaging app. So far it's pretty amazing, nice interface and love the customization. However, there is one thing annoys me is the interruption. For instance, I was texting with my sister. But I won't be able to text until I read her incoming message before I can continue. It literally stops me from texting, so I was force to read her message first before I go back to my texting. Very annoying when new messages keeping popping up asking me to ""read"".",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Z G,"Struggles to sync with my laptop sometimes. I resynced but it caused some data loss. Otherwise my experience with the app has been amazing and I reccomend it highly. This is my default messaging app and I could not be more satisfied wirh the powerful services, flexibility and good-looking user interface it provides.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Book Of Oz Ozzy,"Solid text app but needs: to be easier at selecting personalization of text alerts/unique sounds of who texts you can be done but is convoluted; Specific Text msgs that can be locked (doesn't archive);option to add confirmation of deleting=>too easy to swipe+delete-at least there is an undo button that shows up for a bit. Love ""out of office"" option, pinning important contacts, auto change to darker nighttime colors option, you can use other keyboards, etc",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dominick Thompson,"The best sms experience I've found on android. Feature rich, but not without bugs. There's some scaling issues on the windows 10 app (fixed now! 😊), an image resize problem that occasionally irks me on web/pc platforms, some missing contacts when texting from other devices, and occasionally a de-sync bug that sends old, failed messages. No other app I've tried has matched the usability and features of pulse, so I will continue to use their platform, regardless of occasional glitches.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall it is a pretty good app, simple and well fuctioning. The only downside is that there is no way to search text within convetsation. The ""Search"" option will show up only in the top main page. Once getting into individual conversation, that ""Search"" option is gone. Hope author could fix that, then it will be a perfect app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Medium Chungus,"Subscribed for PC access and scheduled messages. Now the default Message app handles that, no problem. I dealt with the images not consistently sending/arriving. With the clumsy sync stutter when I'd switch devices. The constant ""this image is too large"" when I'd try and send *nominal* screenshots over pc. Finally pulled the plug when several of my threads just up and disappeared today. Not archived. Just gone. Meh.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I wouldn't have love to give this app 5 Stars I really wanted it to work. Unfortunately too many features for me don't work, possibly cuz I'm on Oreo, or maybe it's cuz I'm on a custom rom I don't know but the default messaging app for Android does not have these issues. The biggest issue I have is group messaging in the settings is enabled to message as a group however in reality it is sending individual messages and I triple checked and it is enabled in the settings but it is still not working. Second of all when I go to change the ringtone it changes just fine in the settings but when I receive a message it remains my default notification sound again and issue. Other than that it runs really smooth and I was really hoping I can replace Android messaging because Android messaging does not run so smooth. But I suppose I will keep searching.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It has some syncing issues with my comp - I have to go through the whole delete your account sync cycle at least 2x a year. It isn't great with group messages.

I was happy to pay for the pro version.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It does everything you expect from an SMS app and more. Everything is working good so far but the only recommendation I have is to have an option to remove the timestamp from the conversation list. I know that I texted someone today or last week, I just don't want my conversation list cluttered with different timestamps of when I texted someone.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Design is great. Simple to use and has nice customization options. I definitely like this app better than the one my phone came with by default. No ads is the biggest plus for me. Only complaints I have is that there's no pop-up short cut to reply to messages and keep a conversation open like with Messenger. Also, sending gifs is weird. It makes you send them separately to a specific person when ideally I'd like to just tap on the one I want to use in the convo and then confirm sending it. I haven't had this app for more than a week so my rating may slide up or down by half a star but it's definitely a 4/5 from me",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,slappyrats,"I love this app, it syncs my texts from device to device flawlessly and the scheduling message feature is so amazing!!! But my password got changed and my account was deactivated when I bought the lifetime premium. I contacted the developer to get my account fixed but he never responded and I don't want to pay the price for it again even thought I love the app. It works great but there is no help if there's any issues which really sucks. Hey! It got resolved! The app remembers if you purchased it when you make a new account somehow. I would 100% recommend this beautiful app :)",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brad Barks,Great App. Seamlessly syncs texts between my phone and tablet. All texts that come to my phone show up on my tablet and texts sent from the tablet show up on the phone. The phone works the way it normally would. Like the feature that allows naming conversations.

Private conversations sometimes wont open, have to click back and forth between inbox and private box a few times.

After using this very well-designed app for a week I happily paid for a Lifetime Membership (it's only $10.99) for myself and for my wife. I did so because Pulse SMS offers features I have been wanting for a LONG time, such as: (1) The ""Repeat Alert"" option under ""Notification Customization"" in the ""Customization Settings"" area that can be set to remind you every minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or hour . . . that you have a text message you didn't notice and haven't read. (2) The ability to easily find any ""Unread conversations."" (3) A wealth of other no-charge features that make the app a clear winner. (4) And lastly, if you pay for a monthly, yearly, or lifetime subscription—the ability to install and use a slick desktop version on Windows, macOS, or Linux. The desktop app alone made it well worth the price of admission.",5

I love the options, the look and functionality. Thanks guys for making a product that I could easily see stands above the rest.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,This is exactly what I was looking for. I am texting from my tablet and my computer. I can pay a one time fee to cover the cost of great features and not do a subscription. Little nuance characteristics that are really neat like coloring of individual text exchanges. Author responds quickly to questions. Great program.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"very happy to be able to text on my tablet. Emojis could be more consistant, but no big deal. I also like the fact that I can get an answer when I have a question. June 11, 2019. update: I don't understand why some of my text conversations show only the phone number, and others show only the name. It didn't do that initially. Very inconsistent.And today none of my texts are being received, even though it shows sent. I'm not receiving texts, either. when I send, it says""sending"" takes 4 minutes.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It is excellent. I love the fact that I can use it on all of my devices. I don't need to grab my phone to do a verification on my desktop. I had a glitch a couple of weeks ago where I could not send screenshots or media. I uninstalled and reinstalled and things now work fine. it's on my list of nearly perfect apps :),5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Edit : I have the paid subscription, and the notifications on my computer do not always show up, especially while my phone is turned off. Great messenger app, very sleek. However, crashes require I uninstall and reinstall, and I wish the colors saved for contacts added after the app is installed and that changed contact colors update the colors in groups.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've used this app for a few years. My favorite part about it is the web client. Recently, some of my messages never get delivered to my recipients, sometimes I receive messages, but a section of them disappear later, and finally the web client stopped sending, receiving, and syncing consistently for me months ago. I'll try to back up my messages offsite and delete them from Klinker, and see if I'm simply experiencing the upper limits of this app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"(1* just for attention, will update after this is addressed) within the last few updates, group texts are incredibly laggy. It takes a solid 4-5 seconds to send the message after hitting send. Normally, that wouldn't be an issue if it was done in the background, but it has been freezing my phone during the process.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I was enjoying using this app very much before It upgraded and stopped working. All of a sudden every time I wanted to send a text message, it refused and gave the error message that the text had failed to be sent. I switched back to another app and all the messages worked perfectly. It's too bad that we were not given a choice about whether or not we wanted to update the app that was working so well. I'm sorry to say goodbye to an app that I really liked. I did send feedback to the author.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Fricano,This is a fantastic text and SMS app that integrates well across browsers as well as phones and tablets. Back ups are included. The only frustrating thing about this app is the VERY clunky scheduling of future texts. Textra does it best but overall I like Pulse better in day to day use. If scheduling could be improved this would be an easy 5 Stars! Edit. The new update has dramatically improved the scheduling experience! Kudos! Thank you. Continues to be a great SMS experience.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jack Butler,"I think Pulse is one of the better SMS apps for Android. However there are a few drawbacks that really annoy me while using this app. I love the fact that is has the compatibility to run on pretty much all operating systems, but it doesn't work very well. Every time I send messages, it hangs. It is almost easier to just pick up my phone and do it from there. I really wish there was a fix for this and I have reached out to technical support about this before and was unable to find a solution.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Great app love it and it's the best messaging app I've come across yet. Although one thing I found irritating is that when I sent a message to my partner with important private info it didn't get sent. The numbers in the information ℹ entered and attempted to send were darkened out from the rest of the txt. Not sure what that's about. You could still see the numbers but they got blocked out for some reason.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Overall a decent app for text messaging. I like the fact there are no ads. Did go through a stretch where i wasnt receiving my text from anyone. Was able to send them but wasn't receiving them. My connection was good, no issues with phone service on that end. Spoke with my phone company thinking was on there end but came to the conclusion after investigating it was the app. Had to uninstall and then reinstall the app. After uninstalled everything has worked fine since. Overall a decent app though",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Draco7153,"I can honestly say after using this app for 3 years it is very much worth the money, super useful when you're on the computer and a great sms app overall. My only complaint is that when I save an number that I have a convo with, the convo tends to take a good while to start showing the name instead of just the number. Never hindered my experience, but frustrating when I save and go back. Awesome app nonetheless",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app, it just works. I've tried Android messages for the web several times, kept signing me out. Pulse has consistently worked for me, keeping me signed in on phone, home and work desktops as well as my tablet. The interface is simple but also customizable, finding a texting app that works well and lets me use my phone as well as multiple devices has been a fruitless quest until now. I've upgraded to the life membership.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Impressive overall, intuitive ease of use, and the cross platform support means everything to me for keeping in touch with friends and family, including quick access for emergencies. Thank you for this! I almost immediately purchased the lifetime app. My one request (please!) would be for the app to be available in the Amazon store for Kindle Fire.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,aTina Webb,"I love Pulse SMS. I use it on my phone and appreciate having access to it on my PC. Managing my texts, forwarding, copying, delayed send for those you realize you don't want to send, archiving, groups that I can name and on and on. The best feature and the reason I use Pulse rather than what came preloaded on my phone is the reminder notification that I have a text I have not read. I have contacted the developers a couple of times and they were responsive and helpful. Great app, thanks.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"As an alternate messaging system, it has the tendency to give the appearance of receiving random pics from random contacts. Even pics that were viewed but never saved to my phone. Even if the thread that contained that pic was previously deleted. How's does that even happen?? I then have to check my default messaging app to see what pic was actually sent. Fix this immediately. There is a glitch in the matrix.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mary Kennedy,Had another Messenger and it kept stopping. Looked for another and found Pulse. Yes!! So far so good! Been using off and on for almost 2 years. Still the best so far. Have some trouble with Group Texting which is paramount for me. People don't always get the text. However l still like it above others. Update: Looking for a great App... You found it. I absolutely love this App. Worked the glitches out of people receiving texts.. operator error. You can't send group texts back to back. Wait.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Dotchi Latham,"I love this app. I can schedule text messages, put messages in folders, and make messages private so no one else can read them without a PIN. That's the major reasons I use the app. Plus, I can use text messages on the computer which comes in handy from time to time. Definitely worth the .99 I pay a month for that feature. I highly recommend this app",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"So far, I am quite pleased with this app, especially at 112 mg! This has the features I was used to with my previous longtime app. However, that one took up 3x the space! I was stuck mostly uninstalling, going back to the stock text program, then reinstalling. NO dark modes in this Android! Not even in developer options! I use an older 8g J2 Prime. Way less storage than my old Android 4g, bummer I lost that phone! (As long as I have an unrooted phone with removable battery!) This allows all the color adjustments, nice dark backgrounds for my eyes! Sends larger pics and videos. Plenty of customization options! So far, so nice!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Harlea Maria,"I really love this app, I feel like it's missing some things like being able to change background as color & picture, being able to add more then one in folder, change color on bubble only, have unknown folder, being able to send messages to people all at once without them being in a group. maybe more customize things. Other then that this app runs beautiful & I'm loving it a lot. I gave 4 stars because what I said I hope they get added in soon or make it more personal & customize to this app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Love the ability to customize each contacts color! I used to use Android Messages for this option, but they took it away with their recent update. Pulse is easy to use, has a clean look, and offers a lot of other options that other text apps that I've tried lacked. Thanks for a great app!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I've misplaced/forgotten/broken my phone so many times this is a godsend! i can access the same messages any time from any device. I'm able to send an SMS on my laptop and it looks like it's coming from my cell. When i switch over phones i don't lose my whole message history - I just download the app and it's like nothing changed. Titally worth the one-time fee for lifetime subscription, which is what I did.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,M R,"I downloaded this because I could not get out of a group chat, and muting the conversation in other apps didn't keep it from appearing in my text list. Pulse was the perfect solution!!!! Easy to use, clean appearance, and the private folder was the perfect place for the aforementioned group chat! Super happy!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"everything about the app is great, except one thing. when it comes to text messages even though I'd receive the notification, when I open up the app I sometimes don't see the actual text sent to me. which is weird. so I'd see it somewhat in the conversation list, then I'd have to guess what they said when its time for me to respond.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rita Baudo,"Bad!. Synced well. Worked really well until this week. Then it stopped working. It was taking 4 hours for someone to get my text and some never got it at all. No place to contact anyone at pulse. Tried to uninstall, then reinstall. Other things. Nothing work. Really frustrating! If you are reading this, pulse , would love to know how to reach you and get some help!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great app, only one that I have found that you can drag a picture into and click send, also can mark unread after reading and much more. 2 things, I can't seem to get the lifetime to do anything once selected, it just goes away and is like to see a choice to send group messages as group or individually please, but still the best app that is usable at a computer also",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,The tablet application puts conversations that are private on the phone back into the regular list on a daily basis. It is only on the tablet that way. But still It allows anyone with my tablet to read those conversations. It also is difficult editing a scheduled text as the top part of the conversation is full size and ur keyboard stays full size.. Leaving a very small window to see what you're editing,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Swann,"Really love this app. I love the scheduled message feature. Wish it was just a little more advanced, though. For example, it would be really valuable if I could set it to repeating weeks and then go in and modify specific scheduled texts without messing with all of them.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Doug Ward,"After three requests to tech support with no response, I believe I have to give up. When installing on my tablet, I get a message saying I already have a primary device, do I want to replace it with this one. Seems like the answer is No since the primary device should be a phone and not a tablet. This also seems like a simple fix from tech support. I have tried options under the 'Danger Zone' by refreshing and also deleting and recreating the account. Perhaps there is no response because I wanted to confirm there was nearly an 80% price increase in the last few months and I questioned the cost. I really wanted this to work so as to be able to text rom a phone and tablet.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Snack,"I noticed that sometimes when I would send MMS the person I was sending it to would never receive it. I switched messaging apps on a whim, and all the stuck messages that failed to send before were sent out. People were flooded with hundreds of pictures from over the years. I do NOT recommend this product.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Ryan “Sketch” G,"This app has quite a few features and functions that I find to be either helpful or fun, however the app gets locked up when trying to open a link/website in some texts. Its also no very easy to mute texts from and individual or group. There are a few steps when their should just be one. Otherwise, I solid alternative to messages or message+",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,"George Maxwell, DC","I like the app and the options it has for customization. It is a little slower than other similar apps, most notably when opening the app and sometimes when switching between areas in the app. It also occasionally freezes for 5 or more seconds. I've tried the app on various phones and Android builds with similar results.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"It works great! However, I do not like the fact that you have to pay a dollar a month to be able to do your messaging on your computer as well! The Google Android messaging app does the same exact thing for free! However, that app crashes on my phone constantly that's the only reason I even downloaded this one!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"This app is ok, I think textra is significantly better. It has so many more options for customization. The textra quick reply screen shows you much more compared to pulse, marks your message as read, and dissmisses the notification. The pulse quick reply gives the same experience as Hangouts. Keeps the notifications intact after you respond, forcing you to swipe it away after hitting send.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Decent messaging app.  However, I lost a conversation with no way of recovering.  Unfortunately, it was a conversation I wanted keep that had almost 2 years worth of discussions.  It just disappeared after tapping the notification to go into the app.  no swipe to delete since you have a chance to undo that.  I had no chance to undo it and therefore lost numerous important conversations.  I paid for the app to get the backup feature but what I failed to realize is there is no point and time recovery for that.  Its realtime, along with the message removals.with no way of recovery.  That's not really a backup and should not be called backup.  Calling it message backup implies that you can recover which you Can't.  This feature should be called sync since that is it's only purpose.  To sync the current status to any device you are logged into.     UPDATE: Hence why I said ""I failed to realize that there was no point in time recovery"".  My main issue was the fact that deleting messages give you the undo button, but due to a bug I lost 2 years of a conversation with no option to undo or recover that conversation all from simply opening the app via tapping the notification",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It's ok but a little clunky. I don't like that it sends emojis right when you click on them. It also often has a delay. It says it is still sending on my end but the other person has already received the message and replied. I only use this app because it's the only way to connect text messaging to my Samsung smart watch with my Pixel phone. Otherwise I don't think it's worth the money.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Scott Bennett,"Really good app with a lot to offer. Scheduling messages for different times is really nice since I work graveyards. I almost gave it 4 stars because the UI is pretty bland, but as far as offering a lot of user-friendly functions, it's far and away one of the best messaging apps it there. If they could just offer a little more graphics on the UI side, it works be perfect.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Peggy Herdlicka,I do like this app it has great emojis. I also like that I can put the text messages in folders and invorder of importance. Would recommend. *update* not as happy with app as before. I had to get a new phone and completely changed the format. I'm trying to see if I can fix it so I'm leaving the star rating as is...for now. Fingers crossed.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Soar -,"Deleting SMS or MMS in Pulse SMS app does not actually delete the message on the device. That's a big bug that makes the app almost useless. Also, it started nagging to buy a subscription. If it does that again, it gets uninstalled and added to my online list of nagware. UPDATE: I'm surprised by the response. This is a known bug that was reported OVER 2 YEARS AGO. The previous developer, Klinker, chose not to fix it, so the bug still exists. Please read your own bug report site for all details.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Walt Tramontana,"It doesn't even auto block spam texts, and their website said it was free, yet as soon as you open it they try to lead you to 'purchase' ... I don't do bait and switch. If you have additional services to offer, great, but let your used click on the feature and then offer a purchase. I don't like pushy marketing and now I don't trust your app having access to my messages either. Uninstalled.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Thompson,"Great App but doesn't work with Android Auto. I've used Textra for years and I got a new phone so I looked for a new SMS app. I found Pulse and love it's features. Message backup and messages appearing on other devices or computers is great. The down fall of this app is you can't use it with Android Auto. AA will receive messages but when you ask to play the text message, AA will tell this app is not supported. Maybe in a future update Android Auto will be supported.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kimberley Morris,"THE Best sms App! Works across all my devices, but isn't Wifi dependent. Sends from my phone on 2g as well. Group texts work well with people on iPhones, which Android texting would not do for me. I love that I can send texts whatever device I'm using. I don't generally keep my phone in my room at night, so it's great that I can see on my tablet if my kids are texting me. I've not had any of the issues I've seen in other reviews, except the keyboard in landscape mode is awkward.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Great cross platform text messaging app. It could use some more features for contacts. The app should sync contacts more than once per day, have options for how often. (time intervals or everytime a new contact) It should be able to add new contacts on any platform and have them sync to phone. (new contact from email and want to text them via web/windows? You must first add them on your phone then resync)",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Golova Phone,"So. I like it. But it does things awekwardly. For example, scheduling sms takes too many clicks, the saved sms is located in a weird folder and does not appear in chat history. Thescheduling button is hidden too many clicks away. Why not make Swipe action call a contacts. New SMS also takes too many clicks. When you write something and forget to send and come back to that chat in a week and delete whatever was not sent - the chat goes up the filter. No way to Lock a selected blurp.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Edit: Had to lower my rating. After a few months, I finally had to uninstall and suffer with stock app. The uninstall triggered ALL of the unsent texts to push through the stock app, over 50+ texts resent to contacts. Awful! 11/11/19: When I first started app was great! Now, my MMS messages aren't being sent or received, group texts are spotty, I know the system is receiving the images because I can see the file in the stock messaging app. I've searched and searched with absolutely no solution.",2

The app is very customizable. I finally found the app I was looking for!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I have the 11 dollar version and it's great! I love the customization and the texting from anywhere (which is far superior to Google's implementation since I don't have to set it up randomly/every 30 days). I love the light weight programming: when my S7 was getting older, the Google messages app would take a minute to load, this app did not have that problem. Even the free version is better than most messaging apps. Excited for rcs implementation.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gloria Smith,So far it is working great. I appreciate no ads. 11/5/20...I guess I spoke too soon. Now the app does not notify me with sound and notification dot. My phone only vibrates. I have went through the steps to set it. I was having problems with my old message app and this was the reason for getting a different one. Now I have the same problem. It is so annoying when you have to keep checking for messages. Helpppppp!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,Pulse app works great across Android devices. Its support for OS wear allowed me to connect my TicWatch Pro. Multi-number support lets me text from mobile number and Google Voice number. The compose text feature was not intuitive enough for my 9 year old to send a message on my behalf. Will be interested to learn more about archiving and accessing the archive. Happy to have the app.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Norfrey,"I've been using this for a couple of years now, got the lifetime subscription, and am very happy with it as opposed to the built-in message apps from individual phone carriers. I needed something that would also be available on my work computer screen so that I could answer work-related texts throughout the day. Notifications come up on the phone and computer screen, so it's easy to keep up with any communication. All in all, this app has been just what I needed!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jose Pico,"This app works great, all the time. It is very easy and reliable. I tried Tablet Talk but found it to be awkward and difficult to set up.

The visuals are similar: a simple color scheme which you may edit via hexadecimal and apply individually or univerally. The premium access allows you to sync with applets for Win, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Chrome browser, Firefox, Android tablets, and online. I find both functions vastly superior to the native Google Messenger equivalents in terms of functionality and reliability. The developer also has remarkable detail in the help section.",5

It is easy to use and minimizes the needless waste of time in replying to or deleting messages quickly. Its notification tab is very useful and a time saver. The only negative, which has nothing to do with the app, is that the developer seems to be a little curt in his replies to others' reviews, which makes me a little weary. Maybe a PR person would be helpful from a customer retention aspect.",5

It works really seamlessly on all those devices.

xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Solved my issue of having one phone number for all text messages. Better than ANY SMS forwarder on the market! I sent a text to my friend from my work phone, and he saw it came from my personal number, and he immediately asked: ""How did you do that?"" Knowing the messages are fully encrypted makes me very comfortable using this app. Considering this is a one person development operation I am amazed at the quality of this app. I am not knocking it for this but your primary phone has to be on for the app to work and I understand why. I think people should be aware of that. I bumped this from 4to 5 stars based on super fast response and learning everything I need was there! Here is what I asked about Whyly four stars? 1. I would love to see partial text copy (maybe I am missing something). 2. Every number in a text I click on only gives me an option to call the number. For example, if I get a pin for multi-factor authentication, I would love to be able to copy it and not just call it. Those two items listed above no way drive me away from using this application.",4

It lets you theme the whole app, individual converstations, it has always worked with no hitches even when my phone is off. Well worth the price. The only reason that I am not giving it five stars is there is no button to pull up emoji's when using a physical keyboard on a tablet. On a phone its right along the top of the keyboard and it looks different than the samsung texting app or textra like I used before so I know its programed into the app. If I shut off my keyboard the tablet looks just like the phone but when I connect its keyboard theres no way to get to the emojii keyboard. Fix it and I will update it to 5 stars hands down.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Best SMS app! Could it be possible to add an easy way to type special characters like ""ñ"" or ""é"" on the web app? I've seen native apps like MS Outlook implement this, for example, for ""é"" you'll press CTRL + ' then the letter ""e"" in your keyboard. Mozilla Thunderbird has an add on called Zombie Keys that adds this type of functionality as well. This kind of feature would make Pulse just perfect for me.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Industrial Lightworks,"Ok so I switched from Textra to pulse and I absolutely love it! Textra didn't have a search option which I truly needed. Also there was some glitch that didn't allow the big emojis to work and I really liked those. Pulse is easy, super customizable, from personal notifications and sounds to special colors of bubbles for each person! I also name all my groups and give them their own notification tone so I don't have to check my phone to know who is texting me. I love it!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,chris keller,"Well, I really liked this, for about a week. Then it stopped working on my laptop. Every time I try to log in now, I get a security message saying: ""You cannot visit pulsesms.app right now because the website uses HSTS"" Whatever the hell that means. I sent two emails to support and have heard nothing. I tried a couple of fixes through web search and they didn't work either. Too bad, I really liked it when it worked. Still works on my phone, but I need the same SMS on both devices, so I have to uninstall that now. Bummer.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christopher Anderson,"I liked the app better in the beginning. Now, sending and receiving photos is next to impossible and receiving can be unstable. It's disappointing how this app is failing now. I'm missing texts from family and friends, photos are not being sent, it's going out. Time to look elsewhere, I have it a shot.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jevonia Martin,"I do like this app but I've noticed that multimedia messages do not come through if the data isn't on so if someone randomly sends a picture to you for example, you'll never know since it doesn't show up at all. As small as this may be, it makes me want to switch to a different app that at least acknowledges there's a multimedia message waiting to be downloaded. Please review & rectify this & I will update my review up to 5 Stars.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tessa Gilmore,"Used this app for months, loved it. Woke up one morning, all of the sudden was recieving no notifis. No vibe, noise, or banner. Only way to see new SMSs is if I opened a convo. Still got notifs from all other apps including other sms apps if I switched the default. I don't know what happened, phone didn't update during the night, no setting anywhere was impeding notifications. Tried restarting the phone, the app, cache clear, reinstalling, switching default SMS. Nothing, unfortunately unusable.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tim Shaw,"Love the app but just missing 1 silly little thing. A way to enable a badge showing how many people each text was sent too. This is texting 101 guys and makes it so I cannot even consider your, otherwise, awesome app! Would be 5 stars but for that simple, yet important option. Knocked off another star, seeing a list of thumbs up replies from a group I sent to, with no way to HAVE A NAME Next to them makes your app absolutely of no use to me. A real shame… I really wanted to use your app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Close to 5-star. Feature-rich, customizable, assign specific colors to people, text from computer, scheduled texts, backup & restore, more. The -1star problems: usability related, too hard to see phone numbers for people, impossibly bad for group texts, save images/media clunky, no persistent left column for conversation list-- far too much backing out of existing conversation, folder implementation good on phone app but terrible on desktop. Missing features: create or select video message",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Awesome texting app, love that it works on any platform, can get my text messages even on my linux computer. I bought the lifetime subscription and am glad I did. The only feature I feel it lacks is a driving mode that could auto reply with a message. Would be nice if you could turn that on and off manually and also set certain Bluetooth devices to use it automatically.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I left the stock android messaging app because I craved more customization. Pulse gives me infinitely more control. Changes are made at the contact level, so each conversion can be personalized (which is crazy helpful if you have multiple contacts with the same name and you only give a cursory glance at who you're talking to). A great app!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Josh Anthony,"I will change this to a higher rating once they fix whatever is causing media messages to be very unreliable. They send, but only occasionally. It says sent on my end, but the other person never recieved it. Great app overall, but this problem is making it hard to use.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Installed, set up account and began using as my default sms app. Instant issues with phone locking up. Tried reinstalling, refreshing account, everything I could find in the help documentation, but nothing worked. After restarting phone, it would work for a few minutes then lock it up. Biggest issue is it starting causing the phone to show no SIM cards, only way to get back on the network was to reboot again. Good looking app, but I think there are still bugs to work out. Running a new phone with stock Android version and memory is not an issue. Be that as it may, will not run on my stock android phone, unless the developer has another suggestion.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,It has been smooth and seemless between my phone and computer. Very nice way to backup messages! The only issue is there is no way to export your messages to use with any other app. All messages can only be viewed and managed through their app and interface tools online.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,TC Gompf,Excellent all around. Also good on Windows PC. Edit: essentially looks horrible on the big screen of a Samsung Galaxy Zfold-3 even now five or six months after the phone is released. I've tried to go back to it because I liked it a lot in the past but until they make it look good on a big screen... forget it.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Greg Balint,"I've loved using this app for years now, however there was an issue that came up (resolved now) where their website and desktop app became unreachable and non-functioning. Still a great app, but might need to think about your needs and the fact that this is cloud based for the multiple device functionality. Would be great if they offered a self-hosted option.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mary O'Rourke Sullivan,Works very well! I do a lot of group texting on my Samsung and unfortunately the preinstalled message app split those reply text into separate conversations. Very confusing. Pulse enables the replies to remain in the original stream and for that reason alone I give it the highest rating. Easy to use and does what I need it to do.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Devon Black,"Update: I might have flown off the handle when they were down, coincidentally at the same time I was forced to update, which made it seem worse than it was. They have acknowledged a number of the issues and fixed the technical ones, I didn't see those announcements before. Restored to 5 stars. (still researching privacy situation) Update: some shady company called maple media now owns this. RUN AWAY! bad security certs, probably other issues. Current desktop app is not working, maybe because of the bad certs. Existing user credentials no longer working so you can't even open a ticket or sign in. Maple has bad reputation for stealing personal data anyway, so skip it! --------- Very few problems works as described. I can't function without it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Frederick Brown,"Reliability waning. Unfortunately, I cant depend on this app anymore, particularly for MMS texts. My app shows a message, sent with a pic attachment, but the recipients say no attachments. True for single recipient or multiple recipients. Very logical/easy to use app, unfortunately, I cant rely on it anymore. CN nolonger recommend. June 13 Reponse to Pulse Reply. In response to your suggestion to reach out to Pulse support, I already had , and none of their recommendations solved the issue",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Like it but with issues. Composing a text from notification, or scheduling a text the composition screen is a scaled down pop up. Should not be the case. Composing and selecting Groups takes foreveeeeeer to load, same with all contacts. Need to have a tab for starred contacts in addition to Recents. Good overall. Fix the above and great!",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Moore,Best thing about Pulse for me is seamless and fast integration of contacts on the web interface. I start to type a name from my contacts and it immediately appears. Much faster than the competition. I also like the clean phone app design. I ding one star because sometimes logging in and resetting passwords can be a pain.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Andrew Mierzwiak,"This had been my trusted messenger for the last few years, but I've been just running into too many issues sending/receiving images and videos (just missing entirely from group threads). I found when switching to the native messenger people started getting media I sent, and I started receiving them again. Should that get ironed out in the future I'd switch back in a heartbeat.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tammie Shea,"Update: I have contacted by email several times now. Do we want to have this conversation here? I think it would be better if you used the contact info I provided via email to resolve this? I've had several ""we've done some updates... try again messages."" What are the updates? What is the problem you're trying to fix? I hate feeling like it's me, not you, but actually think it's you, not me. Original Message: I have been a happy Pulse lifetime subscriber for years. Unfortunately, over the past few weeks something has happened with the service and it is completely unreliable. Texts sent through the web app in Firefox take up to 27 minutes to be sent or received. This is beyond disappointing, and I will be moving on.Giving two stars because when it worked, it was great. I hope whoever has it now (no longer Klinker) will work out the issues.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Murphy,I have love hate relationship with the app. I use it for multi platform support but it has weird quirks. It says I have a new msg when I send a link to someone. It can't handle drag and drop in windows for links. It's poor at synching between platforms even when I got the manual synch button. If I read on windows it won't mark as read until I read on phone sometimes. Ant seem to start minimized in win. I get lots of duplicate text issues I didn't get with default android. Needs more polishing,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,jorge moreno,"Good app, needs improvements and more extensions. Scheduling of messages needs much improvement. Synchronization process, Group management, contact information should include more extensions for notes or other apps that support notes and email integration, Android and PC versions. More side by side integration to other popular social media messaging apps. For long messages there is no warning feedback. ...etc...much more. please improve more, better and make it irresistible. thanks.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"Android Messages became super laggy and took forever to send messages. Even after deleting my the messages saved and clearing cache, etc. Downloaded Pulse and I had zero issues. Sends messages, even MMS very fast. Lots of personalization issues which is awesome. I wish we had the option to replace the letter icon within a chat to be someone's contact photo. Other than that, amazing app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,"I used to love this app! Still do for the most part. But for the last month or so I have not been able to send/receive images. I've checked image vs carrier size limit, data being on, etc as said on the help page. I've even reset the app preferences. Gonna have to try another SMS/MMS app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,A Google user,I like the ability to custom color each conversation. I like being able to pick contacts to the top. I would like to be able to lock specific messages to prevent accidental deletion. I'm still testing out the ability to text from my computer and tablet and will probably purchased the lifetime upgrade.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Patrick & Lana Schweitzer,Has worked flawlessly and is deserving 5 stars. That said I wish there were a tier that adds bidirectional support. Meaning the ability to use either number to text from. EDIT: I've dropped 1 star for losing all my texts. It said my password was wrong and wouldn't pull it back down. I appreciate the 0 knowledge stance but at least give me an local export of I want it. I could've saved all my data before wiping the account and starting over. Still love the function but would love added features.,4

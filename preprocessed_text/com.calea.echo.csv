com.calea.echo,Shaunna 7,"Love this app, it's very easy to use and personalize. My only complaint is since upgrading my phone the personalized notification tones for each user only work if mood is up on my screen at the time the text comes in. Edited 10/25/22-new update totally screwed up the app. If do don't allow the option to monitor phone calls you can't use the texting option. Looking for a new app. üòî",4
com.calea.echo,Tiffany Strodthoff,"March 2020- Loved it for quite a while. In the past 4 months its only gone down hill. Despite updates and attempts to diagnose issues, the help page doesn't exist anymore it still doesn't work as it should. Wanted to try and fix the problems but looks like I'll have to find a new app now Update 7/2021 continues to get worse. Wont send texts, while still receiving them, can't run diagnostic 10/2022 WORSE YET! Can't see anything in chat list. Have to manually look up a contact or read their msg!",1
com.calea.echo,Keith „ÄéTalos„Äè,"This has been my SMS app for years. I bought it and even recommended it to others. Unfortunately, I cannot to that any more. All the recent updates have each reduced the quality of the app further and further. It is sluggish, tries to show ads when it is paid, won't directly send pics from the camera, and now it won't even open. Unacceptable!",1
com.calea.echo,Autumn S,"I have used Mood for years and with several different devices. I've never minded that they had advertising on it, but this most recent update has made the advertisements huge, and it now massively lags and is halfway unusable. I even considered getting lifetime premium thinking that without the ads maybe it would work better. But I literally can't even get through the purchase premium page without it having an error and not being able to buy it. Now I have to find a new text app ):",2
com.calea.echo,Whitney Turpin,I have had mood for a couple of years now. And I had the premium service. Until you updated your app in 3/22.  And it kicked me off from the premium service.  And now I cannot get back on.  It says that there is a problem on your end every time I try. And NOW... you're update today has ads all over the pages.  Which I absolutely hate.  Which is why I paid for the premium service to begin with.  If the problem is on YOUR end you need to remove the ads until you FIX THINGS!!!,1
com.calea.echo,Wesley Cook (Caerdivon),"Every update there's something different for me to complain about. Previous update was issues with double notifications with the forced overlay (which was able to be fixed with an obscure setting). Now, with the most recent update the app lags *HARD* if its open for more than a few minutes, requiring me to restart the app after each text message to be able to comfortably send it without the application lagging behind my button presses by 1-2 seconds. This used to be a great app, what happened?",1
com.calea.echo,Jessica Gillette,"Had used this app for years until a couple of months ago when it became so glitchy and slow I was forced to get a new messaging app. You guys had something great and then ruined it with a bunch of massive ads that slowed the app down and glitch out. Too bad you won't learn from your mistakes (and no, I won't buy anything from you because it still won't work).",1
com.calea.echo,Annette Groseclose,"I loved using this app for years. However with the most recent update it's become a terrible nuance. It will not allow you to turn the bubble popup feature off, it freezes and locks up constantly and is super slow. I finally got rid of it. Wish they would have left it alone the new updates ruined the app.",1
com.calea.echo,Aaron White (Aaron),"I like the customizability but I am unable to upgrade to premium. I need the premium version for use with my Huawei GT2 Pro watch. Ergo, it's of no use to me. Because it's the only messaging app that works with the watch, the watch is less useful because of the app. Extremely frustrated. I spent 45 min trying to figure out how to give this company my $14.99. It could be an issue with my very normal Android phone but I highly doubt it. Now I need to send the watch back. So thanks a lot!!",2
com.calea.echo,Eric Mcdow,"I have been using more for a long time and have referred many of my associates. This last update is absolutely horrible! Sluggish, freezing, or just completely not responsive! In addition I paid for premium service that was taken away with this last update. I used to love mood. But at this point very disappointed. I hated the last update with all the overlays after calls and text!... just go back to the Original mood I was using 5 years ago and leave well enough alone please!",2
com.calea.echo,Lavelle Hall,1. After the most recent update text are taking way to long to go through and some are not sending at all. This is non-negotiable. 2. There are still a lot of blocked out emojis. 3.Now the app's notification isn't showing up on my watch when new text come in. This feature is the most essential part of having a smart watch. Not being able to receive notifications on my watch makes this app's rating a negative 1.,1
com.calea.echo,Serg Eguiarte,Update: Mood Customer service was fantastic in responding and found the issue was with my settings and not the app. Thank you! The app doesn't notify me of incoming messages. The sound alert is gone. What can I do to fix it? I've tried everything and I have the paid version.,5
com.calea.echo,Christina Goodnight,"I have been using this app a long time and am a premium user. I can't use this app anymore. It's excruciating slow and laggy, when I pull down on messages it slides over to contacts. I can't even type a message without it being so behind it's so slow. It freezes up. I won't be using this app until they fix it back to how it used to work.",1
com.calea.echo,Hillary Brown,"Used to be the best messaging app ever. Hands down. I even bought the premium. I still think this could be the best but I keep running into problems like two separate pop up notifications with no way to pick one or the other. This could probably be resolved easily enough, except that notifying support through the app fails to go through. Every. Time.",1
com.calea.echo,Dean C,Loved this product for years. Actually a paid user. The interface and private box were very good. But through each of the last two phones I have transferred this app to it has been excruciating to send or receive mms photos and messages. I've tried multiple texting apps with no issue on this subject. No one at Mood seems to be able to correct this and for the first time in over 10 years I'm changing apps.,2
com.calea.echo,Kayla,This last mood update has been terrible. My messages are slow to respond to and slow in receiving.. I have to close the app constantly in order to send messages. Please provide a fix for this. It's getting annoying and frustrating. It takes me about a minute to text a message and another to send. I sometimes also have to open the app to receive messages.,1
com.calea.echo,Ken B,"Just as everyone else has said, Mood was excellent over the years until the three most recent updates over June-August 2022. Now you can't remove the bubble, you will get multiple notifications for a single text, it stalls, and the notification that normally appears on the app itself alerting you of a new message and the message count, has disappeared. Definitely time to find another app if they can't get this fixed!!!!",1
com.calea.echo,Blondie33 Delong,"Since the recent update your app is super laggy & unstable!!! I can't even write a text most times, without having to completely close the app & restart it. Or the message gets deleted before I can send it. I have used Mood for many years & have absolutely loved it & never had any issues with it. Now I am going to switch to a different messaging app. Please listen to all your costumers reviews & fix these problems!!!",1
com.calea.echo,Mike Savenelli,"Had to remove due to a recent update. A new call monitoring feature called After Call takes over the phone app, adding nothing useful, and you cannot fully disable it. It also adds more ads during and after phone calls. You cannot use the SMS app without this feature, nor if you deny the app access to phone calls. I'm disappointed since this has always been an excellent sms app, and these new features are both unnecessary and unwanted.",1
com.calea.echo,KS W,"I did use Mood for years. Quirks, let it go. Downloaded it today. Unfortunately none of my sent typed texts appeared, only the response texts. I tried Mood settings, my own phone settings, no change. I uninstalled, reinstalled, no change. It's still my all time favorite, except it's non functional. If the bugs are fixed, I will definitely reinstall again.",1
com.calea.echo,Kelsey Isenberg,I have had this app for years never had a problem until now. It has become very very slow. I cannot even text anyone without waiting for mood to catch up or going back several time to correct what was actually picked up out of my text. It misses every other word of so. Getting frustrated and may have to find another option,3
com.calea.echo,ShayComposed ‚ÄúShay‚Äù,"Love it!!! I was skeptical on download at first, but going through all the options and customizations I've found it to be way better than the default apps that come with any phone, no matter what phone. [[ July 7, 2022 update ]] The only issue I've found recently is the App glitched (after immediately updating the App as per usual) all my texts got wiped. It was a great thing I synced and did the ""Backup/Restore"" features' process. That was there only thing I experienced kind of querky. üíØüîí",5
com.calea.echo,Donna Fick,A few years in and it has become annoying and increasingly difficult to use. I truly don't need my phone (used as a phone) linked to everything in the universe. I don't want to give more permissions. I don't want an app to tell me it needs to be more intrusive so it can serve me better-every time I make or receive a call. I don't understand why it tells me 'call started' even after a received call. I'm tired of having to swipe in multiple places to get rid of all the notifications received.,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I rarely send a review on anything but I had to say something about this. I've had the app for a little over a year. I liked that you could customize it, it was fun. BUT NOW, there's ADS! Nobody wants to see ads in their texting app, something you deal with having ads; internet (fine), games (fine) not in a texting app. It really doesn't help that's its placed at the top. Very disappointed. Currently looking for A different app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"üò° This app used to be fantastic and had a lot of great features for the user to enjoy, especially the themes! However, that is all in the past now, as this app sucks more with every update that's made. üòî Every time I send a text, I get an error saying, ""failed to send"", even if it actually did send. So, there's no way of knowing if it's actually sending or not, unless you call the person you attempted to text to see if they received it. It also takes forever to download photos; like hours. üëé",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've been using Mood and enjoying its features for some time, but after the recent update, I've switched to a different SMS app. Like others, I'm not okay with the new ad placed at the top of my message list. I expect ads since I don't have premium, but the ad is badly placed and loads after a delay, which often results in a tap on the ad instead of my top conversation. On top of that, my messages don't seem to send reliably with this update - the wait cursor just spins for minutes at a time.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Publishers help! I LOVE this app and have replaced my phone's original SMS with this! HOWEVER, I can unfortunately only give it three stars because not all the time, but too often, my text messages don't come through until I've clicked on & opened the app. No I don't have the app hibernating, it is very much on in the background. Sometimes it alerts me without having to open the app, sometimes it doesn't. And frankly, that can be quite an inconvenience when people are trying to get ahold of me!",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I've tried about every messaging app out there and wasn't satisfied. For one reason another they always had some feature missing. this app is so comprehensive and has every feature I want. Even some that I didn't know existed. The settings are laid out so that if you aren't tech savvy you can still figure out what you want and if you are tech savvy It offers an advanced setting menu. LOVE the group text versatility.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I have just noticed an issue with this otherwise great app.  Whenever I go to send a multimedia message, typically a photo, the app disconnects from WiFi......even my home network......and then sends it over cellular data instead.  I didn't select this and I can't figure out how to de-select it.  If I can't get this fixed, I'll be discontinuing use of this app because I don't have unlimited data on my current plan and don't plan on getting it.  I would have rated it 5 starts if not for the aforementioned issue.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"perhaps this App doesn't work well with the Galaxy. The app froze constantly and caused my phone to lock up at least once a day. I like the graphics and the features. However, sending group messages is a hassle. The app would freeze and no new messages would come in until I either shut down the phone or deleted the group chat. I contacted the company twice and explained the issues, seeking a solution. They did not respond to my messages. I uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Overall, I like the app. Occasionally, I receive messages days after they were originally sent! That's beyond annoying and problematic. Update** It's a few months later and I'm STILL having the same problem!! When I go into assistance, it doesn't showing a ""warning"" button. So as far as I know, there isn't an infering app. I'd update to premium if I thought that would solve the problem! Love this app. Truly don't want to change to something different. Any help would be appreciated!!!",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Works great - sometimes. No ads which is great. A lot of customization, also great. I like the design and layout. However there is sometimes a long delay in sending messages. And I'm often not receiving any messages unless I actually have the app open. And yes, I have checked the settings. It's the app thats glitchy. When it works it's great, but it lags too often and I had to move on to a different app.",3
com.calea.echo,Nick Pizarro,"I have been using Mood for years now, so I eventually bought the full version. However, Mood seems worst now that I bought it. If I reply to a group message, my response is sent out as an individual text to all of the recipients in that group; my settings are not set to do that. Additionally, the app seems considerably slower. Attaching photos from gallery to a text doesn't work; it only shows a gray box in the photo preview. The app is updated, but if these things aren't fixed, I'll be leaving.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"My new phone wouldn't do group messaging w/o sending individual text to each person in the group. Which I don't want. Neither the phone carrier or the phone co. could figure it out. So I downloaded this app. it works great! I would give 5 stars but it doesn't seem to send my pdf attachments. When I asked for help for this and another issue from the ""support"" I got no response. But for texting, group texting, and sending pictures it does a great job!",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like many of the features, but I'm having a problem. I've sent several messages to ""support"" and haven't even gotten a response, just an acknowlegement that I sent it. When I use my voice to text feature, which I prefer to use most of the time, after I stop talking my message is duplicated at least once. As a result, I have to go back through and edit my message before sending it, or look like an idiot for sending the same verbiage repeated several times in the same message! Time to replace it",1
com.calea.echo,Brad Sharp,"By far the best features of any SMS app available. However, I'm having horrible problems with receiving messages on Android 10 and 11 (LG and Google phones). Delivery is often delayed until I unlock the phone. Which defeats the purpose of instant messaging. Also, the chat heads feature only works about 10% of the time. I've been working on solving the problems for over 6 months and multiple devices. All settings that could affect delivery have been addressed. Mood doesn't appear to have much in the way of help. 5 stars if these critical issues were addressed. Until then only 2.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I used to love this app. It was by far the best the SMS app out there. But some recent updates have caused the app to go to üí©. The ads were a negative because they said it would always be free but I could live with them since the rest of the app performed well. But now it is slower. Freezing up. Not sending notifications when SMSes received. Sometimes I can't click into a contact to read the message. I gotta crash the app and let it restart for things to function again. Fix it! üòïüò°,2
com.calea.echo,"Dr. Karen Clark Scott, PT","I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've used this app for years. I love the customization options and ease of use. But support is lacking. I've probably sent 10 support messages over the years and may have heard back once. In the past month, floating notifications stopped working. Messages often fail or take 5 minutes to send. I hate to leave but I need something more reliable.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,some interesting features but after paying for the full version and using it for a couple weeks. it is too automated and has some limitations. for example pictures have to be sent as links if too big. also too many features that aren't relevant to professional users. noisy and cluttered UI. wish i could get my money back. my mother had the same feedback. also no web or browser based texting. i was hopeful but that hope is gone.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It pains me to leave this review. I have been a long time user, but recently the app has become unusable. I could handle the introduction of ads, but soon after my multimedia texts would not send, and I wasn't receiving texts until I would open the app. Then in an update, mood would sneakily send a link for recipients to download the app anytime I sent a text. I couldn't even see it on my end. This has since been fixed, but the other issues persist. I wanted so badly for this app to work again.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Better Before. I've had this app for a couple of years and loved it for texting. Then they updated and made the phone call so weird. After a call, you get this weird screen. Then I just updated again and now I have an ad at the top of my messages screen. It is started to get annoying to constantly see ads on your screen. Or have to see anad every time someone calls.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,The app updated this morning and I haven't been able to send text message since. It looks like it sent but nobody is receiving them. I still receive messages but I can't send them. I even tried rebooting the phone. PLEASE FIX SOON. UPDATE: Thanks for fixing this app. This is my favorite app for group texting. You can change from mms to sms easily. You can also add or delete people from a conversation without having to create a new message thread.,5
com.calea.echo,Justin Luttrell,"It used to be really good, but lately I've noticed the incoming messages get delayed. I'll open the app and see like 3 different messages from different people pop up in less than 10 seconds, as if they'd been stuck. Also, as of whatever update prior to June 23, 2021, now every time I get an incoming message, I've noticed my phone WiFi will disconnect a few seconds before I see the message. EVERY. TIME. It's really annoying and I've emailed the support team, we'll see if they actually respond.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love this SMS application. it has a ton of features and customizations too. it also doesn't seem to take a lot of ram so your battery should be fine. I have a huawei mate 10 pro. it has a big battery anyway. I am experiencing a problem. when opening a message, the application at times closes. once opened, it doesn't do it for awhile. still this is annoying because your whole message isn't saved. please fix this. I'm on 8.0",4
com.calea.echo,Carrie R,"I am beyond frustrated with this app. I've used it for years, with the occasional glitch, but it's been pretty reliable. Lately I get no led notifications. My phone stays on mute, so that's the only way I know if I have a text. It seems there are general notification issues from other reviews, which is a huge issue! Please fix this, we need to know that we have messages!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Horrid since update. Yesterday I got a pop up telling me I needed to update the app so I did. I've been using it for years with no issues. Since the update, no message I send gets delivered to the recipient. It shows on my end as sent, but they never get it. Then suddenly the message is just gone as if I never typed it. Unfortunately I have to uninstall and go back to stock messaging since that one isn't having issues.",1
com.calea.echo,Angelica Nagy,"I have used mood for years and have never had a problem, until recently. It's easy to use and the media options are great. Except I can't seem to send pictures through the app any more. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Reset my phone. Gone through my system settings, everything I can think of to do, and still can't send pictures. And since that is something I tend do a lot, It's very frustrating and I'm seriously considering using another app.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"So many customization options, even in the free app, it's crazy fun! The chat options and all the help this app gives you on making sure you have your SMS & MMS settings correct, and help if they aren't working. And all this in the free version. When there are ads, which seems infrequent, they cover about half the screen usually you can just hit the back button & they go away. The only suggestion would be somewhere to get little tidbits of information about what certain symbols and such mean.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"*UPDATE* I still like this app. It is one of the best apps... However, there are still some blinding flaws. If you receive multiple pictures at once they come in blurry not like if you just received one. Also, contacts that are in the private box do not remain hidden when texting. Their notifications pop up like anyone else even when the private settings are in place. Now after the update almost every message is getting flagged as a failed message to send. Things aren't getting better.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This app was phenomenal. The customization is great and you can edit almost anything you want in terms of speech bubbles, background, themes, etc. The recent problem it's having is my text messages are coming in hours after they were sent to me, and some of them are time sensitive due to my job. For now I've had to switch back to my regular keyboard because i absolutely can not have that happening. I see others have the same problem so i am hoping it is fixed soon.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This is the perfect app. However, the update they just pushed today adds a gaudy, in-your-face lime green banner up top for advertising purposes (that when you tap, restarts the entire app). There isn't any way to turn it off, and the text on the banner says it is specifically there for new features specific to this app, so it's just sitting there as a frustrating placeholder for no reason. This ain't it, chief. I guess it's back to Textra for me then.",2
com.calea.echo,Sonfa Lovings,"I use to love this app, but after the recent update, I've had nothing but problems with this app. I no longer have sound with my SMS notifications. Went through all the settings to ensure they were set correctly and still can't receive sound notifications. It's a real pain to have to constantly look at my phone to see if I have text messages. Will have to revert back to the original messaging app. This one has becoming useless.",1
com.calea.echo,Danaii Davin,"I've stuck with this messaging app for over 2 years, before finally uninstalling it a few days ago. It has increasingly gone from slightly glitchy, to all out technical instability in that time. The biggest pro with this app is it's clever aesthetic design. When looking for a replacement for this underwhelming platform, I was hard-pressed to find anything that equaled up to it's customization/options. But that pro can only last so long when you're missing a good chunk of your personal messages.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Notification Sound Gone I used to love this app due to the fact that the black theme is easy on my eyes. It's flawless when it comes to searching through messages, themes, and how everything is displayed. BUT, suddenly I can't get a sound when I receive a message. It's infuriating. I'm not the only one, I have read a few with the same problem during this same period. If it's not fixed soon, I'll get another apo.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've always been relatively happy with this app, having used it for a couple years now, but as of late not so much. Pictures I send, only show as the last one sent, even when clicked upon. And I no longer get the pop-up or heads up notifications despite having them enabled. I'm not a fan of the random color change of my contact bubbles either.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like this app, except almost every day the app will freeze up on me. I won't be able to open a message and/or send any messages. I ended up walking away from my phone for a bit and when I finally come back up it, it'll be working. It seems like if you're trying to do more then one thing, this causes an issue with the app. EDIT: Uninstalling this app. I keep having to restart my phone due to this app being overwhelmed. I can't send a text and receive one at the same time.",1
com.calea.echo,Samuel Barr,"I've been using this app for years. This past year, I saw ads in my inbox. No problem, I was happy to purchase the premium version to remove the ads and support the devs. Today, however, I started getting ads as push notifications from mood out of no where. I paid to get rid of those, but apparently it doesn't matter. There are plenty of other free (and ad-free) messaging apps out there.",2
com.calea.echo,CJ Kadar,After I got a new phone I started finding issues with mood. It's only gotten worse with updates. There is NO customer support. The buttons are just for show. I haven't been able to receive any images sent to me and mood claims it's because of my phone's battery optimization (which doesn't even have an option to optimize mood or not because it's grayed out). I just tried to switch between messagers and now I can't even open text chats in the app and can't figure out why.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I have been using this app for over a year now and within the the past 2 months I've had issues with an app update. Now I get the ads banner on top of my list of messages which is distracting and now all of a sudden, I can't send messages!!!! I've deleted and reinstalled this app twice and it keeps doing the same thing......NOT SENDING MESSAGES!!!!! So to hell with this app!",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've been using this app for several years and generally been pretty happy with it until recently; other reviewers cover most of the other recent issues. The most recent update reset my custom notifications, and crashes the sound picker every time it tries to open it (i tested the picker with other apps and it's only this one it crashes with). Between this and all the other recent issues, plus the ads, this is kind of the final straw. I think I'll be looking for a new sms app.",1
com.calea.echo,Sara Barrett,"I have used this app for a couple of years so when the ads started I didn't hesitate to upgrade to the premium version. Unfortunately, for several months now MMS messages consistently fail... Both sending and receiving. I've sent emails and haven't had a response. In reading the reviews I see this is an issue for several others as well but I have no idea if it's being worked on based on the replies. I'm disappointed because I paid and am now forced to find another app due to the MMS issue. :(",2
com.calea.echo,morgan moore,"I love this app, but since the last update I have not been able to send or recieve pictures messages. I've check all the settings and email for help. No response. If I'm not able to fix this I will unfortunately have to change apps. Which I don't want to do since this app fits all my customization needs and keeps it all organized. Outside of the MMS issue this app works perfect.",4
com.calea.echo,Cazador64,"After months and months of the app only vibrating when I received messages, or in most cases, not even getting a message until I opened the app itself, one of the updates finally fixed it. But now, again, less than a couple weeks later, it's back to the same issue of only vibrating instead of ringing, and not receiving messages unless I open the app. And no, it has nothing to do with the Do Not Disturb slider. I will be moving on until it gets fixed.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to love this app - but have been experiencing more and more problems. I really loved how customizable everything is, but have been getting three notifications per text (two from my phone and one from mood, with quick replies that I have turned off!) I miss this app but I hate getting three simultaneous notifications. Reached out to support 20 days ago and haven't heard anything back. Would love to go back to mood once these issues are solved.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Was working great. i even purchased the app. Recently I tried to change some of the settings and every time I did, it would get a blue tint on the list of messages. Only way to get rid of it was to reset to defaults. I did that and now I can't find where the setting is the have check mark when someone reads the text. That feature is extremely handy.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Unfortunately, I had to change my rating from 5 stars down to 1. The fonts are no longer working... I get a download error for some reason. Also no new themes have been added in over a year when I was told there would be new ones coming soon within the next few months. Also (again)! Whenever I try reaching out to the support team, absolutely *no one* responds back anymore. It's a dead shame because I really loved this SMS app. I'll just uninstall it and move on to chomp or GO SMS Pro now.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Worked well in the beginning.  My only complaint was that the sound notification within chat was a short bleep.  Customization of sound when the app is closed no longer works, just another short beep as well.  Very easy to miss messages.  I've set it up to hear the sound notification through headsets as well, but it never came through either.  Pretty unusable now.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be a great app, had it for years. All of a sudden it's been useless. I turned the caller id feature off because it's a nuisance & it still comes through. In order to see the separate chat list messages I have to close the app completely & go back in because there's no way to get to the other lists once you've already chosen one. & now I get absolutely no text notifications. I won't know if I have a text until I open the app & new texts have been sitting there for hours. Uninstalling.",2
com.calea.echo,Annie Singer,"I've been using this app for years, and at some point they added a sneaky new call feature. It claims to add caller ID, but all it does is track calls and mine data. I did not agree to this. I keep turning it off (which is hard to do, and set up with so many skeezy dialogue boxes) but it turns itself back on every time. It has an option to ""delete your data and content,"" but this link is broken and always says it failed to delete. This is not what I want from a texting app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used this app for a while and it was pretty good. However since the last update group texts are no longer working. The app just keeps crashing over and over again if you try to open or write a group text. I submitted a ticket via their ""Assistance"" function in the app, but no response was provided after several days of waiting. Had to de-install and look for a different messaging app. Sad that they can't get that fixed and that the support is so poor.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Love this app but there's no simple way to view a contact, as a result there's no way to set a contact as a favorite unless you edit the contact and hit save because apparently the star doesn't show up during contact edit. That's just weird to me. No option to mark messages as unread. When searching for message context it'll find and highlight it but it doesn't include the remaining text messages so essentially you don't know where in the conversation what you're looking for exists. So stupid.",4

It was quick, I could group text, send pictures and videos. Recently I have not been happy with the app. I cannot get messages unless my phone is unlocked, which is not ideal, and as such I do not get notifications to my watch in a timely manner and I cannot open pictures from anyone else. Really disappointing.I hate the ad placing. Forcing us into premium?",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I haven't gotten calls yet, so I can't say anything about the caller ID. The customization is great, and party mode is a cool idea I haven't seen anywhere else. The only thing that bugs me so far (and it bugs me a lot) is the app icon itself. It always looks like there's a notification. Why do so many SMS apps do that? With all the customization options, I'm surprised you cannot change the app icon like you can in Textra.",4
com.calea.echo,Kate Patton,"Originally, it did everything I wanted. Now, it still does most of what I want but with the last update it now has extremely intrusive push advertisements. Not only intrusive but also disruptive. This needs to be taken care of.

Update: Thank you for your response, that fixed the issue.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,freezes like water in Antarctica. Was good for a while. Really enjoyed it. But now it doesn't seem to work well at all. Could be the last phone update or the app. Not sure if the app is compatible with the update. What I do know is that it freezes a lot and I don't get my txt unless I open the app. No notifications on phone or watch anymore. Fix bugs or see customers go elsewhere.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used this app when I had my moto z2 play, as the default messaging app was absolutely unbearable to use. and let me just say: I LOVE mood. the customization features are incredible, along with the built in animated emoji and gif support (which I have never found in any other downloadable MMS app). the only thing that ever bothered me was how huge the notifications are in landscape mode. I play a lot of high-speed reflex games, and often times the notifications would block up half of my screen.",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"this app is great!! it perfectly gives me the look and feel of an iPhone without really having one. my only complaints are that you should be able to name groupchats, have the contact picture show up next to the name right above the chat, and most IMPORTANTLY be able to adjust the space between text bubbles in the chat. the bubbles between the sender and the recipient are too close together. please fix, otherwise great app !!",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I've been using this app for several years and it was working JUST FINE until you did whatever you did in the last few updates. Now all of a sudden I get 2 notifications, one from my systems and (thankfully) the floating notifications. 5/31: I give you credit for fixing the double notification & the tone issue. But you still didn't fixbthe chathead issue. which was easily the best feature. Very Disappointed.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"the app was good until they installed caller ID. I can't turn it off, I've missed several calls because now my phone doesn't ring when someone calls me. I went into the app to turn off all caller ID settings & they keep coming back on after I've swiped to turn them off. I'm very upset about this so I'm going to have to get rid of it. there's no privacy with the caller ID either. a picture of the person calling pops on your screen then when you hang up the last text between you shows. not good!",1

Each new update breaks more and more features (emojis, notifications, etc). Strike two. Now I'm getting ads in my notifications via this app?? Unbelievable! Banner ads within the app are one thing, but popping up outside that is an absolute no-go! Uninstalling this garbage.",1
com.calea.echo,Lori Warden,Loved this app for years. I love all the customizations. But the last update in the update today have caused a lot of issues. Lately I never get my texts on time. I may not get a notification for 30 to 45 minutes after a text is actually sent to me. Unless I have the app open and I'm actively using it. The most recent update has caused my group chats not to function. Once I select all my contacts to send the text to the contact selection window just stays open. I can't actually send the text,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Ever since the update my messages will sometimes not come through until I open the app and they'll all come streaming in at once and out of order. I have not changed any of my notification settings or power settings and it looks like I'm not the only one with this issue. When it worked it was great. It's practically useless right now though. I'm uninstalling in the meantime.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Loved it initially on my new Galaxy S9 but I can't get the different notification sounds to stay. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. I think the tones are different when you're looking at a text than when your looking at the list of contacts you've been texting. I want the sound for that contact to stay the same no matter where I am on the phone.,3

I bought a new phone, thought that would fix the issue and paid for a lifetime subscription, now it's freezing up again and not sending texts for hours or until I open the account. I've tried troubleshooting. Don't waste your money on this app until they get it together.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I've been using this app for years without any issue. All of a sudden about a week ago the sound on notifications stopped working. I've tried adjusting all the settings and app permissions and nothing helps. The only way I can get a notification is by using the vibrate option. This isn't helpful unless I'm very close to the phone. I love this app but unless I can fix this problem I'll have to switch to something else. I'll change my rating back to 5 stars once this issue is resolved. UPDATE: Still having problems with sound notifications AND now my text aren't coming through for hours. No texts and then I'll open the app and they all start pouring in at the same time but they're from hours ago. According to the reviews I'm not the only one having this issue.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I normally love this app. lots of customizations. however, lately it had been having issues. Like ""telling""me I have a new message, and I don't. It's an old message that says you have hit download button to view it. It's always one that I previously saw already. If you can fix this, I'll give 5 stars, If not, I'm cancelling my premium subscription and find another app because it's very annoying.",4
com.calea.echo,Hanna Castle,"*Edit* Did not change any settings, notifications are set to default. I used to be able to even set to have custom tones to different people, that haven't been working for the past 5-6 updates, but now I don't have any sound what so ever! From the look of the reviews, it seems I'm not the only one! Again after the update, the notification sounds stopped working! I love this app but not being able to set the notification sounds to my liking is a big negative for me!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I loved this app. But after androids latest update the chat bubble has started to act up. Before when someone texted you, you could click the bubble and text through that if you didn't want to open the whole app. But now when I do that after I send the message it closes the bubble right away. It's annoying since that was the most convenient function of the app. Even if you change the setting to keep the bubble active, every time you send a message it will instantly close unless using the full app.",3

Im missing message notifications and dealing with crashing. I love the features of this messenger and hate not using it. Other than the bugs for my Galaxy 8+, this is a really awesome app. Took away a star",4

Showing notifications when they are none, not showing notifications when there are new ones, resurrecting old notifications that had already been cleared, displaying texts out of order, etc. I don't know what happened but I absolutely do not recommend this app in its current state. I'm currently searching for a replacement.",1

Now on regular texting, it constantly says it is still sending or that it has failed even though the recipient has already responded. I can't ever tell when a message has actually sent. Customer support has been useless. Hate to have to switch, but looks like I do.",1

Updating review: I don't know what the developer has done, but now every time I finish a phone call (never use Mood app for calls), the screen goes to Mood with an ad. I use my phone for Waze a LOT bc I travel for work. Every time I finish a call I have to exit Mood to get back to my navigation. This is frustrating and annoying and potentially dangerous.

Instead, it just tells you that it's too large. Yet I don't run into this problem with other messaging apps.",2

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This is my favorite app. It has so many settings that are both stylish and extremely useful. It has no ads, ever, and it's premium is so cheap for the yearly plan ($5) that it's a treat to have. Not only that but it responds and looks a lot better than my default messaging app, so overall I hope whoever made this app never gives it up or turns it into a cash grab. It's honestly perfect where it is in my eyes.",5
com.calea.echo,Yolanda Stratton,"I use to really like this app, but every since the update I am unable to attach pictures through the app. And I'm unable to download message tones. I use to be able to download ringtones and message tones, but not anymore. Especially for my private messages. In the contacts, it doesn't allow you to set a message tone. Im very disappointed with the app now",3
com.calea.echo,Dakota Hobday,"It's okay, gone downhill. I used this app for years but recently, the loss of stickers and most emojis has really sucked. Some basic emojis don't even show up anymore, only as 3 dots. Starting to get ads but not as many as others. Images sent to me crash sometimes. The customization is amazing and I love it, although I'm sad to have lost the option to have extra fonts as it crashes my phone otherwise. I'll be forced to leave, I think :/",3

Custom text tones do not work and if I try to change a text tone (currently only Pixel text tones are working) the app crashes. I used to love this app. I even purchased the premium. Very unhappy. I have been hoping for an update to fix this but nothing. I've have play thru headset off and turned off safe mode. Nothing...",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I liked this app enough to buy a lifetime subscription, despite that filling in contacts for a group text was clumsy. But now it's constantly bugging me to turn off WiFi! Why??? I don't have unlimited data, so turning off WiFi and forgetting to turn it back on can be a big problem. I went back to Google Messages, which doesn't seem to mind WiFi being on.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It's great. Allows custom tones and text bubbles. Doesn't do regular ringtones but it's just for texting. Contact colors are customizable. The only drawback is that if you are writing a message to someone and someone else texts you, the message gets sent to that person instead of who you were texting.",5
com.calea.echo,Kilika765,"Okay I'm done with this app. Ever since they started incorporating the ads the app just doesn't work properly anymore. Text messages don't always send, missing texts, always glitchy where I have to constantly keep closing and opening the app, etc. This app used to work FLAWLESSLY, then once they start making money off the ads the app goes to hell. Makes no sense to me. There's way too many issues that have been goong on for months now that it's obviously not going to be fixed. BYE!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to be great, but after the update a few weeks ago, it's been inconsistent. Exhibit A, I sent a text 10 minutes ago and it's still loading to be sent.

I love this app and want to keep it, but will uninstall if this continues.",1

I hate to complain over one detail when everything else is great (and I do mean great) but the DoNotDisturb notification only has one option and no way of allowing individual notification sounds.

Plus, if you disable drawing over other apps you are locked out from even using it at all. Only options are to change settings or quit. Yeah, real flexible, huh Word of advice: forcing stupid half-baked and unasked for ""features"" on your users will drive people away from your app. Idiots.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like the app, it gives me a variety of customization options. Which is exactly what I love in an SMS text. But one thing I love more is smooth and cohesive functionality. Whenever I get a popup message from the app in my notifications that one of my friends texted. I usually like to send a reply to them while not actually being in the app. Sadly, whenever I write a text outside of the app, it never sends, then fails to send. I also have to wait for the text to fully send before closing the app",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Wow. surprisingly great texting application. I really liked the features and flexibility with this app. However, I wish that the name and icon would change and appear a bit more professional.

com.calea.echo,Stephanie Smith,I have enjoyed this app for years until recently. I am no longer able to reliably send pictures and I am one to send a lot of pictures. The MOST annoying part is that sometimes the app will indicate that the pic failed to send when it really did. I have no way to know either way so ultimately I end up bombarding someone with the same pic OR they never get it at all.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love the feature where you can hide the private messages, but the app gets hung up to much. It freezes a lot and I have to go in and force stop it to get the message to go through. Lately when I send pictures they just get hung on my end, but appears they are seen on the other end. The person will comment on a picture even though on my end, I still have moving dots. Update 1-23-20- Fix the hangups..I have to force stop a lot with this app.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I used to love this app. So cute with the custom themes, love the ability to set custom colors and alerts for different people. But this latest update has me wanting to uninstall it. Big ad banner at the top of the screen, very intrusive. A bug where it looks like your texts are still pending but they have been received (because you get a response). Three texts deep, still showing as pending. Turned off Head Notifications months ago & they are still on. Never replied to my bug report :(",3
com.calea.echo,Courtney Hipp,"I've had a lot of ups and downs with this app (""breaking"" when updated), but when everything is working correctly (as it apparently is now), this is my review: Fun and easy to use, lots of options in the free version, little to no ad intrusion.

com.calea.echo,Bill Johnson,"This app used to be the best for instant messages, but it has deteriorated. I have tried to send support requests from the app and it fails with an ""unspecified error"". I have tried to contact them by Facebook messenger, and they don't reply. I have noticed in the Facebook comments that many people, including premium members are unable to get replies to their support issues. The app used to have a setting that allowed a chime to be rung on the hour. However, that setting seems to have disappeared. I had turned this on a while ago but now want to turn it off, but can't yet it continues to chime. Sometimes it chimes on the hour, but sometimes it chimes randomly so it is no longer working properly. This is one example of how things have deteriorated. I used to rate this app 5 stars, but no more. Too many problems and no one replies to support requests. I will delete it soon and use something else.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Was great while it lasted. In the past few months I started having trouble getting message notifications while my phone was locked. They would all come rolling in when I unlocked my phone. And then when I started getting some random caller ID/unknown caller messages after a phone call I got very confused because this is supposed to be a text messaging app. It just got to be too much trouble so I had to uninstall it and now everything is working how it should be with my notifications and calls.,2
com.calea.echo,Travis Royer,"Been using this app happily for years. Now as of about 5 days ago, many of the emojis are not working and just display three dots in a circle (wether I'm sending or receiving). I've tried everything up to and including deleting everything and reinstalling, and problem persists. Contacted cucumber support, but no response as of yet. App updated about 10 days ago, and I suspect that is when the problem started. Hope something is done soon to fix the issue, or I'll have to find another app.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Best I've Used. My only peeve is if you have to open the app instead of using its popup window it takes a little while longer that way. Love the features and customization and I really like that you can enable the popup and reply from there or choose from a list of customizable quick replies. I've gotten so much use out of that feature.,4
com.calea.echo,E Mazing,"I had this app for years and loved it. After an update in late 2021, text messages started showing up hours after they'd been sent. The most recent update only made it worse. More times than not, I don't even get text messages. Group messages are the worst. If I even receive tgem, they come in as an individual text then populate in the original group message. So I get double the notifications and nothing shows up in the order they were sent. As of today, I'm deleting this app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"TL;DR: great unless you use a smart watch. I love the customization options of the app. It works great on the phone. But when there are multiple messages, the notification changes from the message content to ""2 new messages"" until you drag the notification. The problem is that it does the same thing on Wear OS which completely defeats the purpose of having a smart watch if I can't read the message. Incoming texts also don't vibrate the watch when every other sms app seems to just fine.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Super personable and versatile! Edit. Deleting 2 stars from initial 5 star review due to 2 separate occasions when messages just stop arriving through Mood. I send a message, which doesn't even confirm as sent, and replies just don't happen . Fortunately, messages weirdly arrive via my phone's standard messaging app, which isn't set as my default, so it won't let me reply unless I switch it back from mood. So twice now I've had to reinstall the app to get it working again. Hassle.",3
com.calea.echo,Shannon Baz-Casper,"I love this app - the customization options are great! Unfortunately, the app underwent a recent update that makes it buggy and it no longer shows me when I have new messages. Even more curious is the fact that I keep getting errors when trying to renew my Premium subscription, and because it's expired, I'm now getting ads. I've emailed Mood support but have received no response. How can a company run when users can't pay them?",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I'll be honest, I love this app. It actually lets me send group messages, I love the themes feature, overall it's a very enjoyable experience. I started having issues when it began managing my phone calls. Not hugely, I just had no desire to be redirected to my messaging app after calling someone. Easy fix, I just removed their permission to access my calls app. And now I'm not allowed back inside the app without that permission. Not a huge issue, but enough to convince me to find a new app.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like the app a lot, I was having a hard time with messages app crashing and happened upon this. It's been a lot of fun to use, however when I create a group message with only two other people it always separates the responses (even when turning the group message on). Three or more people works fine, I would really just like the two person group message to work.",4
com.calea.echo,Al Mag,"Awful!!!!! App suddenly decided it had to be the default message app...which it already was! It completely locked up even after several reboots and only decided to work if permission was granted for it to take over the device's display and give itself priority over anything else on the screen, regardless of what other apps were running. Try driving on a highway with a Waze map that's suddenly blocked by stupid texts you can't hide or ignore. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Do not install!",1
com.calea.echo,Rita Austin,I deleted this app because lately I haven't been able to receive notifications when the setting is on. I also can't stand the ads I've been getting. I can't do anything without it poping up. It can't handle group chats bigger than 4 without having me receive them completely out of order or freezing and restarting. I have another issue where I was checking for a message and a notice came up about a free trial almost being up and having to pay later. That's not what I downloaded this app for.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,So Bummed. I have had this app for a couple of years now and have absolutely loved it. But in the last month I have had nothing but issues and crashes. Double texting. No GIFs. Failed messages. Closing and restarting the app. My friends are annoyed and so am I. I have reached out 2x through the app and also on FB messenger and no response or attempt to help me solve this. I want love this app again but I'm going to have to dump it if I can't get support. COME ON MOOD!!,2
com.calea.echo,kate barber,I have used this app for a few years and used to love it but since the last update I am so annoyed and beginning to hate it. Now I am unable to use the quick compose feature. I turn it on and it works for maybe 2 minutes and goes away. I have tried to change settings etc. and nothing works! Also any emoji i get does not show up it comes as a random circle with 2 dots. If those issues don't change soon I will be finding another messaging app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Uninstalling until the caller ID function is removed or you have the ability to turn it off. Multiple complaints of this feature and the developers/support are just telling users to turn it off when you can't, it just re-enables everything you turned off.

When activated, the font size can be adjusted in a message chat using the volume up and down buttons!",5

People text me but I don't see them hit my phone until I open the app. Two is this caller ID thing with after-call info and no way to disable it. It says it's disabled, but still operates. Annoying as hell. These need to be remedied or I'm going to look for another comparable messenger.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Used to love it. But now the ad driven version has replaced the initial free version. In a market that's flooded with messaging apps, this seems to be a self inflicted, totally unthinkable move development.

I tried quite a few alternatives to the Android message app and this is the absolute best one.

Today I sent out a text message that was supposed to go to each recipient individually, but it went out as a group message. Anyone who knows me knows that I HATE group messages. No one wants to receive a random text at 2 am from some unknown persom replying to a mass text. I specifically chose the option to send to multiple people and receive individual responses, and I got group responses. I just uninstalled.",3
com.calea.echo,Kimberly Powell,"Absolutely used to love this app. It was the best app for blacklisting, scheduling, customization, secret mode, and basically everything. Sadly the new updates force unwelcomed changes, having to post even the smallest of clips to YouTube, where other apps allow you to send them. Pictures not being able to be sent. I have had to download the textra app for all clips and pictures. It's sad really. Even the basic messaging phone app allows better picture and videos to be sent. And now the review",1

No other texting app I've used needed all this maintenance.

There are better apps that show your messages, don't kill your battery, and actually work correctly.",2

com.calea.echo,TeenyStudio Flicks,"The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see.

I'd love to know when the texts actually come through, not 6 hours later. I'm on a Samsung s10+ I'd really love to see this bug fixed asap or I'm going to have to try another app. Thanks.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"It used to be a great app. Now not so much. Notufications don't pop up on screen, not even the head notidication! The screen doesn't wake up when a message is received. Customer support non existing. I wanted to pay for the subscription, now I'm glad I did not do it! I gave it two stars because I still like the app and is between the best SMS options but you should fix issues!",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Just downloaded this app a few days ago and it was working great, purchased the lifetime license then a day later all of my messages are stating failed on my end but the receivers are getting them. Some ppl in my group chat started sending me individual MMS downloads that would fail. Checked and adjusted all the settings to try & fix the issue to no avail. It has gotten so bad I removed it. I've sent support emails with no response. I want a refund!",1
com.calea.echo,Tee,"No way to disable this stupid Caller ID that takes over your screen after every call. It's interfering with my job because I use my phone for work and GPS and the Caller ID keeps popping up over everything. It shows its not even enabled in settings but yet still keeps popping up. The toggle to turn it on and off doesn't even work. Thought maybe switching it on then switching it off would work, but it doesn't even toggle and it isn't even on! Idk why they won't fix this.",1
com.calea.echo,Teddy J,"Extremely disappointed by the recent addition of notification ads. I don't want you sending me random clickbait garbage while I'm not even using your app. Not to mention, the notifications are set up in a way I can only assume is deliberate to make it unclear what app is sending them - the app icon is hidden, no mention of Mood in the text. I'm willing to put up with a lot but this is genuinely shameless and I'm not accepting it - been using the app for years but this is an instant uninstall.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This app use to work great on my last 2 devices. Since I have installed it on my new phone, it has been terrible!! The MMS messages won't download, and my photos won't even come up when I am trying to attach and send them. What is going on???üëéüëé *UPDATE* Both of those settings were checked multiple times, and it's still not working properly. I am no longer using this app!!!",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I ‚ù§Ô∏è this app again (they fixed the receiving issue!). I like all the customization options & the msg alert sound notifications for different contacts. I've been using for about 9 months; so I've had time to form an opinion based on performance. The only time I've had an issue was 2 updates ago when the sound for received msgs went away. Luckily after complaining by many of us they got it fixed. I definitely don't like my back up msg app!,4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Last update ruined app. I can no longer send/recieve texts. My notifications stopped working. I have been using this app for years and then it stopped working. I have a S10+ and I would love to keep using it if it started working again. This seems to happen everytime you guys do an update. It's so frustrating.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Anyone can help me with my notifications? I used to have the edge light working, plus the notification on top(like a bubble) not the icon. Now all of a sudden, I just get the icon at the top left, edge lighting(enable) doesn't show, and the notification bubble doesn't show. I cant seem to figure it out. Any help will be appreciated!",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"After the last update, none of my individual notifications for texts are working. I have submitted a ticket through their website, and no response at all. It has worked perfectly for the last year or so, and I love the app, thus why I bought the premium version. But this may make me go to another one if not fixed soon.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Too many issues with this app. One day it downloads photos, the next it doesn't. I'm always messing with the SMS MMS trying to find its sweet spot so it will be consistent. I've yet to find it. I switch over to my basic texting app that came with my phone to view any photos received. So I've needed two messaging apps to handle the job. Today I'm finding one texting app that will do it all, then I'll completely uninstall Mood. Buh bye.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Tried a lot of different messaging apps and I always come back to Mood because I love the features: the secret/private folder that you can even secure with a finger print (securely hidden for those private chats with contacts), all the customizable features it allows, the different themes you can choose from, the huge selection of backgrounds to choose from or choose your own, and much, much more I could brag about. One of the best for the price compared to competitors! Great app! üéâüéâüéâ",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Been a big fan of Mood and have used it on two phones now.  But recently I have only started getting texts in bursts.  Texts sent several minutes to hours ago won't come in until I get a bunch all at once.  Since I use my phone at work and also have a teenager, not getting texts in a timely manner is a big issue. Until this is resolved, I have no other choice but to move to another app.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Well I was enjoying mood, I think the stickers they provide are hilarious and liked the layout... But then it started with this caller ID pop-up AFTER every call- why? It's just one more thing I have to close. What is the point of that! And then this new update brought a super annoying ad banner at the top of my texts! And I've had issues with group texting forever--I wouldn't get messages for hours after the conversation happened, and a jumbled out of order. Deleting and finding a new app.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Ever since the update on the 19th I don't receive sound notifications or head bar notifications. I've uninstall/reinstall, soft reboot and hard. Nothing. Then the update on the 24th didn't fix anything and I've tried everything.

Until then you get 1 star.",1
com.calea.echo,Sarah Callaway,"No longer works, used to be amazing. Fun & great features but now emojis come through as circles with 3 dots, pictures wont send, shows 'mms failed' and half of the time gifs don't send or receive. I have to open the app to see I have an MMS, then it downloads showing the current time not when it was actually sent. I deleted & reinstalled, edited every setting in the app and my phone but still not working. Go to app for years but moving on, will try again in a few months. ü§û devs I ‚ù§& need this!",1
com.calea.echo,Greg Kollatz,Used to be great. Has become more and more intrusive and annoying as the app tries to increase advertising. Also this is a text message app but it started to try doing stuff with phone calls and is annoying and hard to trust. I uninstalled. Might be better off with a paid app that just does what you want with no interference or unexpected new behavior.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Have used this app for years. usually love it. however lately, I'm not getting notifications until I actually open the app. I hit the icon and all.of a sudden I have 30 messages, all coming in at the same time. something isnt right here. I've read the other reviews and tried all of the fixes listed in the developer comments but still only notifying me every so often.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love this app! It works flawlessly on my Samsung S8. My messaging with TMobile will NOT work correctly, and this gives me a GREAT work around. It works with DIGITS, so all comes thru to my US Cellular phone. It has this great option to convert MMS into multiple SMS if you need to, and since the tmobile network will NOT send my MMS correctly, this is just PERFECT! THIS is my business phone, so this has really saved my bacon! The emoticons really emote, lol! I'll never go back to their built in app. Haven't tried voice and file sharing, but I may put it on my kindle just to see what happens! Thanks guys!",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Very detailed customization experience. In that I think this app has no equal. However, I have a problem where larger texts I send or receive show up as multiple small texts and for the life of me I can't fix it. Tried contacting the developers several months ago and still no answer. I had a 5 star review before that happened, but since they ignored me I'm kinda ticked.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,This application was cool at first. I really enjoyed the fact that I could customize it easily and the emojis are cool. BUT. At one point the MMS stopped working. Can't send/can't receive. I emailed them 3 times. Absolutely no reply. I find it disappointing but the lack of support is enough to make me uninstall it. Was fun while it lasted,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"There are alot of fun qualities to the app..great emojis and customizations and looks available. But there is huge wonkiness with MMS. For me, it makes it unusable. pictures often don't come through when someone sends them, it throws a weird MMS error..and some messages are completely lost or missed. What in the world. I finally just switched to another app and everything comes in fine. Not sure how many things I missed while using Mood. The lack of MMS reliability is a deal breaker for me.",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Will change to a 5 star when they put back the ability to receive notification sounds. It happened after this last update. I have been using this app for about 3 years now and I love it! I love the practically limitless customizable options, but I hate that I don't receive text notifications anymore. Was the best now not so much. Older version was better. Update 4/26/19 just lost the floating notification function. Fix both and 5 stars is yours",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Got to love it for a while anyway :( I downloaded Mood because I wanted to customize my interface (s) for texting. But as everyone else is saying, this new app with the ad banner really ruins it. In my case, the phone is undeniably MUCH slower waiting for that banner to load, so trying to open any text, let alone switch between a few in a minute, is very unreliable and irritating. I'm gonna have to uninstall at this point. I was holding out but I'm done putting up with all this lag for an AD!!!",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,I loved Mood because I was able to have the chat head notifications that didn't show a preview of the text (without turning the preview off). This worked great because I didn't want the messages to pop up on screen but I was still able to read them on my Galaxy watch. Now chat heads don't work and I have to allow all content to be displayed once received (not cool when showing someone your phone and a private msg pops up). Please fix this!! I have to use another app now.,3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This does what all text apps do, and it does that very, very well. What makes it even better are the customizations. You can have it as plain and utilitarian as you might want, or you can make it look and feel exactly as the builder in you wants to construct it. If it made it easier to see all the names and numbers of group text participants, I would be ecstatic. (I keep another app on my phone because it does this one thing better) But I'm never giving up Mood. It's just too good to let go.",5
com.calea.echo,Nicole S.,"I used to love this App, until the last few updates. I get double notification windows which are super annoying, there are emojis missing from before (just shows a circle made of yellow dashes), and now I can't send a video without needing a YouTube channel?!?!? Are you kidding me??? Guess I'll start looking for a new text app if these things can't be fixed.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Final Edit: New update has solved the issue, thank you! 1 Star until you fix sound notifications. This is the second time your update has caused this issue. Every other messaging app works just fine. Yes I've forced closed, yes I've rebooted, yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled, your app is currently failing and clearly I'm not alone. Edit: Yes i checked ""play notification through headset"" as you suggested, no it did not work.",5
com.calea.echo,AKA e-chollie,"I have used mood for years. In an auto update a couple of days ago, it has completely changed its appearance where the text is the same color as the background on the chat listing and i am apparently unable to change it. Also, it has hijacked my phone. I have a phone app, as all androids have. I do not wish for a text app for redundancy of phone operations. Because this has all happened without my consent and i cannot disable these changes, i have decided to uninstall my premium mood app",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I LOVED this app until the latest update. The caller ID feature is unnecessary and interferes with me answering my phone, making me miss my call. I don't need it to pop up with a notification about who I just spoke to on the phone... Just stop. Remove the caller ID feature so I can use the awesome app again. Thank you for updating the feature. I updated my review. üòä Now that I can turn off the caller ID, I really enjoy the app!",5
com.calea.echo,Joseph Clark,UPDATE: 07/05. Some issues have been resolved but now the lifetime membership is gone and you can't resubscribe. Also the app has become completely unusable. It has so much lag that it takes so long for the keyboard to respond while typing. Everytime they update it just gets worse and more unstable. 2.3e in May was awesome! This newest update is so bad that I have to go to a different app. Please fix the severe lagg and the paying for your subscription issues.,1
com.calea.echo,Kim Chapman,"This used to be my favorite texting app, but l have deleted it because it has so many problems. I was receiving the same text 5 times, it took forever to send a picture (if it would go...I sometimes would get a ""failed notification"" but my receiver had actually gotten it). I was also receiving messages about 15 minutes late. I've tried reinstalling and it would work for a while and then fail me again. I'm a premium user...sorry I spent the $$$. Needs LOTS of work!",1
com.calea.echo,Cheryl-Ann Kashiwamura,Updated 8JAN20: This app is very frustrating! It constantly sends my messages way later than wen it was sent. It won't send the messages until I open the app so I never know when people actually text me. UNINSTALLED APP! NOT WORTH THE HASSLE! The app keeps sending me messages with a link (that you can't even Google) without a phone number attached. Obviously I'm not stupid enough to click it but I would like it to stop.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Textra incoming messages has no notification sound. A few years of this was enough so I searched for an alternative. Sure glad I dug in and searched to find this Mood treasure that the sound works along with jewels that Textra don't have. I been set free. What I don't like is the microphone icon right next to the send off message where I accidentally hit many times. I'm hoping one day to see it there no longer. Thanks creators!,5
com.calea.echo,Amanda Bower,"Have had Mood for years and I'm a lifetime subscriber. I love it...HOWEVER the last few updates have ruined a perfectly good app. Texting window for the caller pops up after every phone call and texts are stamped with the time they were supposed to be delivered, but they're unreliably delivered minutes later. I shouldn't have to check my app multiple times in order to get my messages to come through...ended up going back to my stock messaging app until they fix their issues.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Honestly the best of the third party apps out there. BUT. Customer service through their support email is non existent, so I'm left unable to send pictures taken by my phone camera, and videos that are sent to me through this app are low quality to the point of being unwatchable.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"The customization options are great and I enjoyed using this for quite some time. Then suddenly, I was getting texts *hours* after they'd been sent to me and it was causing problems so I switched back to my stock messaging but kept mood on my phone. Randomly started being spammed with stupid texts. The most recent one was about buying books or something. And I know it's coming directly from something related to mood, because it's not showing up in my stock messenger. Deleted.",2

However, I cant seem to find an option to remove the quick reply menu from the status bar on top, and still be able to use it in the drag down menu where my notifications are.

It just simply does not work any longer! Its performance is very laggy! It doesn't respond to any selections I try to make which includes trying to compose a message! I had uninstalled it & reinstalled it 5 times--setting it up as a new setup! But no change! Please repair this!",1

I can only see downhill until they fix these 2 issues. Done with the app.",1

Like, right away! It's super annoying. Update: 7/17/20... The newest update causes the notification icon to stay in the upper part of my phone until I actually tap on it. Even if I swipe it away, or even go into the app and read the new text, that icon stays there until I tap on the actual notification. Pretty stupid.",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I love this app. However it stops receiving incoming messages and images randomly. Today I got 4 images that were suppose to be sent with text early in the week.

MMS are not staying grouped into a single thread, now, and get broken up into 3-5 separate threads, with each containing some messages from the original thread. I have also started receiving random notifications, with no actual messages showing up. And, more and more, people are sending me text messages that I never receive. Also, the new ad bar is terrible, and no one responds to the numerous e-mails I have sent for help.",2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Absolutely loving this app! Great themes and customization options, as well as fonts and custom gifs! Only issues I've noticed are the ""assistance"" zendesk server being down and notifications are grouped to the app, not the message, so the moment you open the app it clears all the notifications, regardless if you've read the message or not. Love it though!",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Mood Messenger is so cool. I'd give it 5 stars, and love it even more if i were able to change the background for the chat list, use custom fonts (other than pre-installed), if i were able to see the recipient typing, and I were able to see when my messages were ""delivered"", and """"read"" (just like iphone users).

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"This app, while fairly high rated, added a number of extra advertising screens to the process of answering and ending calls. Why a texting app would screw up phone use is beyond me. Anyway, before I installed Mood I could answer the phone with 1 click. After, it took multiple clicks & other gestures to get the phone answered - sometimes it switched over to voicemail before I could get the thing answered. And when ending a call it would bring up an extra screen with unwanted data and ads.",1

It has its uses, and it's easy enough to close if I don't want it up, but what's really annoying is the half page ad that's on the screen every time it pops up. It blocks like half the texts. I would gladly pay for a premium version to remove the ads, but there isn't one so I am considering uninstalling.",3

You have to manually clear them.",3

You can customize any aspect of your messaging - chat list, keyboard, fonts, colors, backgrounds, ringtones, etc - & each individual chat can be unique in appearance & ringtone. You can lock messages, block numbers, password protect & has tons of extras - like GIFs, Drawing, Games - even features I've never even looked into.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,They have double downed on the ads. I will open the app and then sometimes wait over 60 seconds for app to load. Then after the app loads it takes a couple more seconds for the ad to load. Which consequently actually will cause all of your text message threads to drop a quarter of an inch. And if you don't time it right you'll accidentally tap on the wrong thread and open up the wrong persons message. I am officially removing this app.,1

Problem is, when you access your phone's gallery, it only lets you choose from the most recent THIRTY images in gallery.

I installed this on a newer os on my redmi note 7, and now whenever someone calls I get a floating caller ID box, which turns into an ad as soon as the call is over. Really ugly, I hate looking at ads when doing normal phone functions. I considered paying for the pro version, but it's a little pricey at $10.99 and it's hard to tell if that will fix the ad problem. *phone call permission must be selected for app to work",2

Look into this, if it works ill put 5 stars again. Because I really like this app.",2

I love it so much that I disabled my default message app the second I experimented with the color changing because I noticed right away it that it's far from low budget. It's better than all customize sms theme apps I have used in the past. I'm glad that I found this. No ads. No colorful childish looking odd cartoon app logo to ruin your theme. Just the small app's cloud logo. Which blends in very well and doesn't look cheap and childlike. I love it and you will too! Go for it!,5

I can't figure out how to detach Mood from my phone service. I don't want any interference with my phone calls from my messaging service at all. The only reason I use Mood is because the default service on my phone no longer let me assign specific notification tones to my contacts and Mood did, but this isn't worth it.

I had to reset every individual contact to a notification. also I cannot find custom ring tone creating options any where. What happened to this great app? (Samsung 9+),1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,love it! UPDATE: I've been having issues for about 4 days now with FAILED to send messages. I love this APP and really want to return it to a 5 star review. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. Please fix this issue. I'm not having the same issue with the standard messaging app that comes on the phone.,3
com.calea.echo,Brenda Sanders,I used to love this app! However my love for it has died. I paid for this at least 4 phones ago and it has worked flawlessly until my galaxy S21. Now I can't get MMS to send or receive. It repeatedly freezes up. I uninstall it and all of my features work flawlessly with the stock message app. I miss the color and the features of keeping my messages seemingly forever. I hope they get these bugs fixed because I want to be in love with it again.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I loved this app until recently where I can no longer seem to take screenshots. I keep getting an error """"Can't take screenshot due to security policy""   The support from them is 7 days now un-answered  If not for that it would be 5 stars.   EDIT: Had to got to advanced settings, do a ""Reset Settings"" to make it work a again. Lost all customizations but its woking again.  No help from their support (as well as 2 other 7 day unanswered messages) only reason stopping me from rating 5 stars).",4
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Experience is decent but not flawless and not as ergonomically friendly as it could be when diving deep into settings. connectivity has hiccups at times. I'm still a fan but serious attention is still needed on the aforementioned. downgraded to two stars since the connectivity issues are still present on my new device.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Used this app for years and LOVED it until just before the update. My messages were not showing until I opened the app and then the forced update placed that as banner taking up more slave than two conversations. Understand that ads being in revenue but other apps manage to place at the bottom and takes up minimal space. Will miss the ability to have backgrounds and the customizations but will be switching to another app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,UPDATE: The app has gone downhill. üò¢ All of sudden the notification sounds stop working. Actually even the notifications stop working altogether. I would have to wake the phone in order for notifications to come thru. I used to really enjoy this app. But I had to uninstall Team whats going on? None of the background are working. every time I select a customized background for one of my contacts it end up being the same background for all of my contacts and this is not good please help,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Decent app, but what annoys me about it is the fact that it's doing way too much. Why would i want my text message app to also perform caller id for incoming calls? Not only is it unsettling from a privacy POV but it's frustrating cause it seems as if it's a package deal. For every incoming call, you get a pop up that takes the whole screen prompting you to send a text message to the last incoming call requiring 2 extra steps to get back to what u were doing...Why? Deleting soon",1
com.calea.echo,Jessica Capstick,"I have used this app for years, with several different phones and never had issues with it until this newest phone.

Still continuing to have issues with this, and no help! MMS comes through on my other message apps....",1
com.calea.echo,Bridger Keeton,"Text messages dont show up until I open the app itself. Recieving messages should be the main feature of text messaging apps. Not only do I have to open up the app for messages, sometimes messages dont show up for a day/hours if I open it up and that's unacceptable, stay away from this one until it's fixed. It seems like the other core features of this app are broken too like emojis so why even bother getting this one anymore.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Really annoying app. Used it for over a year. In a recent update, the app forcefully managed my phone calls...even though I didn't give it permission to do so.

The only problem is I can't figure out the setting to show there are messages waiting without opening the app. It worked at one point. I must have messed up.,5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Still decent app, but for the past couple weeks incoming messages are delayed. I look and nothing is there... confirmed with sender that they show delivered, then I go back and look later and the message is there, with the original time. Quite unnerving.

Please fix this, I'm tired of dealing with problems with this app.",1
com.calea.echo,T. Lett,Going downhill - can't receive mms! Was great for years. Past week it has gone bonkers. No group texts are working. Can't receive any messages at all. Works fine on other messaging apps. I adore Mood's background features- can't find it anywhere else. But seems like developers maybe aren't keeping up with Android updates? Very sad to lose this once amazing app.,1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Soooooo awesome !!!! I am reading other people's complaints about the app but I have not had any issues. Sometimes a text doesn't send right away but I had problems like that on my built in message app too. I find the ability to customize the best part of the app and I am so happy that I found this . Totally worth the money and I'm enjoying it immensely , esp since I text so much !!! Love it",5
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Best text messaging app I've ever used. I use the free version and I've never felt like I needed to upgrade to premium to get a great experience.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,"I like this app except for a very disturbing flaw.... After I send a text message to someone, the screen flips back to the conversation I had with the previous person. Because of this, I accidentally sent a message to the wrong person (and it was very inappropriate for that person). Please fix this bug!",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"vast improvement, more customizability than any app ive ever seen. Edit, mms settings are a nightmare and i am unable to send pictures and media without having to flip a switch to change from drive to file, i saw a screen pop up asking what my preference is but i accidentally tapped something and now its stuck on drive when i first select a file and i cant find the setting to change it, if i cant find a fix i think ill uninstall because its highly annoying",3
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Pretty good app only irritation is when a text comes in and the text bubble comes up and you reply...it doesn't open the same conversation in the actual app. So when you go to continue the conversation in depth via app (pop up disappears after one reply) it doesn't trigger that conversation. So you can accidentally send a text to another person,4
com.calea.echo,Linda in Colorado,"The app that came with the phone never worked so I got Mood. It works about 2/3 of the time. When it doesn't I reboot it. Mostly it's good and the stickers and emojis are fun, except for the Trump-emojis. How can I get rid of those? Why are they even there? I took off one star because of those. Update: for 2 days I have had so much trouble sending texts that I am going to look for a different app. I have had trouble sending pictures for about 3 weeks.",2

Now messages don't get recieved, I don't get notifications no matter what settings I use (it could be hours before I recieve the text and if I get a notification it is only when i open the app) It could be that the app is incompatible with the s10 and current os since other apps work just fine.

com.calea.echo,Raya and Deano Burke,"This used to be a good replacement app, but each ""bug fix"" is another adware addition.

Searching for a new app now, don't use this one.",1
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"Honestly, I like this app. I really do. I like how it's customisable and that I can give it the personality others lack. Having my own background and tones for each person I contact along with their own bubbles for chat. However, the thing holding me back from really loving it is the fact that not all my messages go through to the people I'm speaking with. It's not my network, I've already contacted them, it's an error on the app's part. I don't know if it's because I have an older phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) that's the problem or what but honestly, this is the only issue I find. I like that Mood is lightweight and just gets the job done when it works.",3

Go to click on a message and it moves.",1

Have not been receiving my texts very glitchy text that I send send multiple times at once. Have to close the app and reopen it received text or unlock my phone. Deserves 5 stars once all the important stuff is fixed. Because I'm changing apps now so sending or receiving texts really is the most important everything else is a bonus.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,Now ever since the recent update it says i have a message but really i don't. In order to get rid of that alert saying i do i have to restart my phone. I also don't hear the notifications. Not a very good update. Deleted messages keep coming back. Should of left it alone. problem is the message doesn't send right away. I have to hit the back button see the check mark that shows it was sent then go back in again. It tends to be annoying.,2
com.calea.echo,A Google user,"My favorite android messaging app - I like that it's easy to share multiple photos and customize colors and themes. I'm not a fan of the method of creating group chat.

com.calea.echo,Char Smith,"Mood from a couple years ago was great. Not only are there ads now, but Mood gave itself autonomous permission to allow adware to send me push notifications. Took me forever to finally ferret out it was coming from Mood. With the 7/28/20 update, Mood constantly crashes. When I apply a theme (one of the reasons I chose Mood), it applies the theme's ""universal settings"" to every single one of my custom-contact settings. I no longer have the ability to send YouTube vids. This app has become trash.",1

I looked around and found this and I'm glad I decided to download it. It is one of the best messenger apps out there, the features to this app are phenomenal! I love the quick reply because when I reply it automatically gets rid of the message screen as soon as I send the message which is GREAT!!! I love the ustom text tones I can apply to each and every contact if I wanted to, I also love the dark theme because for someone like me (legally blind) the dark mode makes the screen look a lot better.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,The interface is ok and has a bunch of customizable themes. Some of my previous sent/received messages did not appear in the app. The free version does not seem to include RCS/Chat over WiFi. Not sure if the premium version has that option but not willing to pay when I have a free stock messaging app. Reason for 2 stars. Uninstalled.,2

And it wasn't a link she had to click on, it just sent to her phone as a normal text. So I am impressed so far. Would like option to open a chat head myself and keep it open like Facebook does.

com.calea.echo,A Google user,I understand ads popping up as banners when I'm in the app BUT you don't need to be allowing companies to send out ads to my contacts NOR should you be sending ads to me via text msgs. I will go back to my default messaging app if this problem continues. What does the in-app purchase cover? Some apps will allow you to buy the pro version to go ad free but I just don't want the ads sent to me or my contacts. I just got an ad for a weight loss prog. I don't need my friends/fam to believe I am sending them ads. They will block me believing they are blocking the ads. This needs to be fixed!,2

Going to be very dull with a standard messenger,2
com.calea.echo,Gary Cavallo,"I've been using Mood for years and loved the overall aesthetic, design including customization options and built in Giphy support. However, the updates recently have been a little shotty. The update before last caused a significant amount of lag. The most recent update fixed the lag but now I don't receive texts until I actually open the app. Very unfortunate. The updates need to start being constantly stable for me to increase my rating. Still having the same problems today even after update...",3
com.calea.echo,Relyc Matoaka,"Love this app and all it's customization features. Individual ringtones, notifications, text, bubbles, icons, and backgrounds? Control over ever aspect of my nessaging experience? I am in love and have gotten 2 others to download it and love it. I'm going to save up and buy the lifetime premium version at some point because this is my favourite app :) *Update: as of 2 updates ago I no longer have access to the app or any of my messages. Hope support release a fix cuz I don't wanna uninstall :(",3
com.calea.echo,Boogie Man,"Love when works. Recent Issues 1 type out & send, message disappears. They won't send & have to retype, then copy in case it disappears again. 2 msgs in group threads show up as mms from the individual person that must be downloaded & then they go to group thread. 3 videos are always ""too big"" to send, even if taken in app & are only 2sec long 4 open app & click a thread & nothing happens, have to close & reopen app 5 deleted msgs reappear Same issues on 2 phones Sam galaxy note10+ & galaxy s20",1
com.calea.echo,Norma Cooney,Sept 30/22 - Well I believe it is time to move on from this app. The ads are back now and again and I don't understand all that stuff after every phone call so I'm movin' on. Sept 7/22 -UPDATE I have started getting ads again. This does not make me happy. Please fix. I did love mood. It was fun. It wouldnt accept Canada as a country for me to put in my phone #. Kept reverting to USA. After using for several months as a paid user i am now getting restaraunt ads.,4
com.calea.echo,hassan adam,"Am an Android developer , i like your app but let your app be able to run processes like recieving messages even after user clears it from background. The app only recieve messages when its active ü§û",3
com.calea.echo,KoshaT JGW,"This app is horrible. Every new update makes this app more and more useless. All the updates seem to do are make the ads bigger, slow down the message sending, and freezes up my phone. There is no point in a messaging app if it freezes up a phone. There is also the problem of the app not delivering my messages to me. üëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæ. I won't be recommending this app to anyone.",1
com.calea.echo,Neven Grossman,I've been a long time user. Love the app. How ever I got a new phone number and have not been able to update my number in my account information for the app. I have been waiting for someone in customer service to help me. Still have not been able to resolve my issue. Also even with premium I am getting ads!,2
com.calea.echo,Jessica H,"What happen to the app today? I went to go use it, opened the app and it completely restarted, lost all my settings and everything!!! Now I can't figure out how to get my settings back!",2
com.calea.echo,Steve R,"I'm frustrated with the lack of response to my messages to them of still getting ads while I'm on premium (from within the app). What did I pay for? I like the app, but the lack of response tells me you're starting to ignore it. That's not cool. Please don't ask me to email you. I already have. Look in your queue or ignore my message. I have experience with that.",3
com.calea.echo,AL Alingarog,"Unknown number folder and notification are not working. It still works on my S7 edge, but when I used it in my A73, the unknown number folder is not showing even if I set it up. Including the notification sound for secret mode is not working at all. I tried to replace it with the built in sound but it is not working. Please fix the bug for android 12.",3
com.calea.echo,Moni Carda,I've emailed and waited. Still can't get premium. I hate the ads. I absolutely hate the ads. I'm tired of nobody fixing the problem. It's been like a month almost 2 now. Still isn't fixed.,1
com.calea.echo,M. Rackley,"Something has changed, I paid for lifetime subscription. It's not acting as such anymore, I'm getting ads for one thing. This overlay over apps demand is something that is now being pushed. I have used this app for over 4 years. Deleting due to this ridiculous excuse it improves technology and better function is BS. ANDROID has advised not to allow this. So that and no longer having privileges for lifeline membership saying goodbye!",1

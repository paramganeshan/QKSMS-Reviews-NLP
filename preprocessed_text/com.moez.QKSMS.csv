com.moez.QKSMS,Al Pray,Excellent app. I have overcome the issues other people reported with images by specifying MMS messages and increasing the compression size in the settings. The app is very customizable and it also includes the ability to archive messages. It's also the only text app that I found so far that has an option to have texts turn the screen on when the screen is dark see you can see the text without having to touch your phone.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,William Irvine,"Update: Realized open conversations don't notify of new messages with the screen off. Kind of a big issue for me. Original: Pretty good, but MMS ""fixes"" haven't worked. Still can't send picture messages after 3 updates that claimed to fix it. I like the app pretty well, but this is a big problem. EDIT: I can send photos reliably now, but they get compressed down to 300KB, which is pretty low resolution. It'll work for now, but not very well.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Mopar Man,Ever since I paid for the all access features this app has really gone downhill. Every time I try to send a picture or a screenshot it fails to send and tells me to try again - it never works. I never had problems before sending photos or screenshots via text. This is a pretty useless texting app if you can't send screenshots or pictures. The only time I can now send a picture is if I reduce the resolution so far that the pic becomes almost unviewable. I'll be looking for a better texting app.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've upgraded my rating!  I've had the app for a few weeks now and am liking it.  I paid so I can have the schedule message feature. It is worth the upgrade. I like that I can send more than 2 photos at a time which I could not do with my previous app. And they just added the feature to copy certain parts of the text instead of the whole text being copied!  One main reason for choosing the app is that the developers actually read and respond to users. And they take into consideration those points that can be improved upon! Thanks for listening guy!!  Kudos to you! One of the other things my old app use to do that was WAY cool was it had a voice recorder option, any chance of adding that cool feature??? ;D",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Aaron Swain,"UPDATE: Since my initial review, I've discovered that this app cannot send pictures, no matter what compression setting I choose. I'm on Verizon, so I doubt this is a carrier issue. Really disappointed, but I guess I can just use another app to do that. Really inconvenient though. Almost perfect. Does everything it's supposed to. I just wish you could customize the theme more, like changing the colors of the sent and received bubbles overall, like you can in other apps like Textra.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Thanks for the quick response. I'll verify that the contacts are available like you indicated. Regarding my comment about the attachment buttons: I use dark mode, and the attachment buttons are black. The background is black. It's hard to make out the dark buttons on the dark background. I'd also like to be able to send a voice memo. I couldn't fit that on my original post. Thank you!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the app! It's very clean and I love being able to customize the colors. It's also just really nice to be able to use and support open source apps. The only complaint I have is I can't receive any mms messages. They show up as empty messages, and even if I turn on my data and try to sync messages, nothing happens. Edit: My phone is the US model of the S10e, so no dual sim.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Hannah Franks,"Honestly, I really liked this app at first, but for the last... 6 or so months (I've lost track of time, so it could be longer), it doesn't let me send photos or GIFs. Super annoying to have to send it through another app every time. I've been through all my settings thinking I messed with something, but just found another review having the same problem, so I don't think it's just me... If it weren't for this issue, I'd say, definitely a 5 star app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great messaging app! I have been experiencing issues with my default SMS app, so I switched to this one. It's nice and easy to use and they update fairly regularly. I love the additional color choices, adds to the personality of the app. I only wish they add a feature that allows you to put an image in the background of the message, adjust the transparency and all that. Here's to hoping!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Hailey Macias,"I had such high hopes! But I can't send pictures, videos, or gifs. They'll send if they're compressed, but it.compresses them so much you can't even tell what it's supposed to be. When I change the setting to ""no compression"" it just says ""failed to send, tap to try again"" and never sends. I love the app, the look, and all the customization options, but not being able to send media is a deal breaker.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Almost there. I've been looking for a messaging app to replace my stock one. I like this one so far, has a few glitches here and there, but the developer takes your feedback serious and works to improve it. Quick responses too. Gonna stick with this for a bit and see how improvements are made to it. Edit: I emailed you about it ""blinking"" or refreshing everytime I open it. Also noticed now, when I attach a picture, it sends the person the correct one, but shows me a completely different picture.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Timothy J,"Everything about this app is perfect except one very important thing... Sending photos. You either have to have it set to send the photo at a very poor image quality, or if you have it set at regular high quality it just returns a ""Failed to send"" error message. I don't understand why this is the only app that does this? Reading through the reviews, this seems to be the biggest problem people are experiencing. If all other messaging apps have this basic capability wouldn't you tackle this issue?",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, very snappy. Always use it on any Android phone I get. Only thing that bugs me is that it seems to completely lack the ability to send videos. It can send photos, but videos don't even show up as an option in the gallery. It will display videos that are sent to you, and it keeps track of videos you send with other messaging apps.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I'm really liking this texting app a whole lot, was using Android Messages but that was gets laggy at times and it uses way too much space! This has the look of Android Messages but texting is way faster with this app. The only thing is I would like to change the contact colors in the list, I'm able to do it for each conversation but I would like to see it in the list as well. Other than that everything works just fine. Thank you so much for a great app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Other than missing a timestamp option and not having the features that have been ""coming soon"" for what seems like forever, and the fact that the scheduled sending is finicky at best, the app is clean and customizable to the point of fitting virtually anyones tastes without being over the top. It has some nifty features that work most of the time... The floating panel for incoming messages sporadically shows nothing, requiring you to open the full screen app, which defeats the purpose.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Honestly, one of the best SMS apps I've seen. My favorite part about it is the layout and customization, it's very easy to navigate and has theming comparable to apps like Textra. It's fairly priced too, which unlocks things like delayed sending and custom colors. Definitely some features to add though, but even as of now, it's one of the best. Edit: Just some small features, like per contact signatures. Also maybe a way to change the color of outgoing messages. Keep up the awesome work!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Sam Miller,As soon as I downloaded the app I was in love. I was using Google messages for the longest time once I switched to this one I was hooked. Unfortunately the only downside is that I have the note 20 ultra and the pictures are amazing but when I go to send them they no longer look great. I switch to auto compression or no compression where the pictures still look great but they won't send. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"looks good. the one feature i need from a text messaging app is the ability to customize notifications based on the content of the message. i get email-to-text messages which has a different from address every time, so i can't use your customized contact notification, but the text of the messages are similar, so i have used keyword searching to customize the notification sound. if you could get that, i would become a paying customer, because my current app (smart notify) doesn't do mms.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Super lightweight but functions perfectly! This is exactly what I needed on my old, beat-up phone. I like that you can easily archive messages and I like that it has a quick reply pop up. The only small thing I'd like added would be the ability to more easily open the full conversation from the quick reply. But that's a minor complaint, you guys did a great job! Thanks for keeping it small and looking great on night mode.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've used a variety of messaging apps and always seem to return to QKSMS. Don't really know why I always fall back to this messaging app, but what I do know, is that it works and has been consistent and reliable. One suggestion I have is for premium color selection. It would nice to have the ability to enter rgb/cmyk/hex numbers. Perhaps, also a preview of the color being applied before confirming the change.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Updating my previous review. A recent update fixed the issue that saving a photo to the gallery didn't actually save it there. Now it prompts for access permission and so successfully saves the image. However, there is another issue. It saves the photo with a date as of the same not the date property on the original image. I just went back to save some images in a text thread, most recent to oldest, and they were saved with current date, making it look like the older images were the more recent",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really enjoying using this app. However, there is a minor issue that I hope developer will fix. The contact does not appear to sync with the conversation. even if i linked contacts, it only shows their phone number. They only sync when I delete the conversation, text them again from the system contact. If the issue were to be fix, this would be a 100/100 sms app!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Honestly, one of the reasons I got this app was because the developer seemed to actually consider people's suggestions. Love the clean simple design and NO adds! Please keep it that way. The only suggestion I would have is that it would be great to be able to use ringtones I've downloaded, not just my phone's default ones. Other than that, this is a great app! EDIT I'm having issues with the number showing in the text not matching up with my contacts",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Blair Johnson,"9 July 2021: App worked great for a couple years. Recently, however, it will not send an SMS to multiple recipients. Instead, it sends the contact information for the additional recipients to the first recipient. I tried using the Help & Feedback link, but that only goes to a PayPal page. So I emailed the developer a couple days ago but have not heard back.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Edit: as of this point, neither pictures nor videos will send. I will be unfortunately switching back to my default messenger. Original review: Pretty good, but still needs work. My main gripe is that attaching pictures on a samsung phone takes multiple clicks. Also, it is current impossible to send video with the app. The app is on the right track, but definitely needs more work.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,SmallBlock351 SmallBlock351,"I would love to use this app all the time but I like to send pictures or videos via text message and it just doesn't allow that! I haven't had any trouble with the app other than what I just stated. If they would just update the app to send videos & pictures thru text messages it would be my primary texting app! Come on now, we can fly to other planets, take a heart from one person and put it in another person so you should be able to make this app send and receive videos & pictures.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Rob Leisy,"Great fast performing text app. Good customization, organizes media within a conversation better than any other app in the store, and has an overall great feature set. One gripe and one question. Wish it had 1second as a delayed sending option. Lastly, is the app opening to the conversation list instead of the conversation I was in when exiting the app a feature or a bug? Having to tap the conversation I was just in when leaving the app to, let's say, copy an address from maps is annoying.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Moez your app is just so amazing. I love it so much! There's a lot that I prefer about your app compared to other ones! A few things I wish you could possibly add is the ability to change outgoing bubble color, it doesn't have to be as detailed as the incoming message, but at least choose between 3-4 different grays/white. Also I have issues with sending & receiving MMS. Other apps don't have an issue with me selecting the ""no compression"" option but this app will not work. My max is 10mb.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Fast, simple, easy not complex, ...needs group texting though at least with options. Other than that good secondary app until a little more options are available. Update: does group texting... had to press space key in the contact window after each entry...learn by trial and error. For some reason the voice messaging microphone didn't open until the second day after downloading. Changed rating to a 5.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app is amazing, made even more so by the developer! When there is a bug (usually a result of Android updates) responses are extremely fast and updates are add well. Ideas and improvements are very fast, and the features are amazing! Group titles, color coding messages by contact (customizable of course), pinning messages so they don't get lost, those are my favorites. The only improvement I can suggest is notification sound based on contact (edit: individual contact, not conversation)",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"After trying it out a few days it seems a little slow when going into messages. Found the developer talking about the app on Reddit and decided to give it a try over Textra. The app is responsive and clean, no extra clutter everywhere. I really enjoy apps that do one or a few things well instead of trying to be the kitchen sink. Only features I really feel I need at present is making the color of the icon in the conversation list the same as the customized color (eg John is blue vs the default theme in both the conversation list and conversation itself), the ability to revert a customized contact to the default, and being able to go to the menu upon leaving settings instead of to the conversation list.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,William V.,"Works and has useful features. Only issue is the ""take photo"" picture-sending option on GBoard will not work on Pixel 3. I can, however, send any desired picture using the ""attach a photo"" option (again, on GBoard); it is a simple workaround. This open-source software is worthwhile. For my use, it is exceptionally functional yet simple, with a pleasant user interface.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Moe Azizi,"If you have issues good luck getting a response. Customer service doesn't exist. The app itself is decent but a few issues like if you start a text but have to answer the phone, you come back to finish it but there's no ""draft"" to let you know where you left off so you have to go through each text to find it. Also, the delivery notice is useless. Sometimes it works but most times it doesn't. So many other issues but minor ones.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Cassandra Meeker,"Was looking for a messaging app without gifs, which can be very inappropriate, but still had imoji's and no ads!!! This app is great! It runs smooth, seems to be compatible with other messaging services and has a smooth import contacts from previous service. Liked it enough to buy the full app for a really low price! Thank you QKSMS! PS; minor suggestions would be to add a text ""read"" feature along with the ""delivered"" that you already have and add the ability to change color of the owner text🙂",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Steve Atkinson,Tried this app because Samsung messenger's speech to text is terrible. This app's speech to text work quite well. The problem is that QKSMS's ability to send quality pictures as attachments is very bad. I don't why. I switched back to messenger and the very same pictures sent and received with the same quality as the camera took. Also I don't like paying for things that other apps offer fir free. Like message scheduling. For now I've gone back to messenger.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Sam Thomas,"Came here after years of using Signal but deleted my account and uninstalled after they removed SMS support. Saw a mention of this app in a reddit thread and gave it a shot. I've tried dozens of Android texting apps and this is my new favorite! Simple to use, clean interface, easy contact color customization, and ad-free. I loved Signal for it's layout and this comes the closest while even improving upon some things. So, thank you Signal for helping me find this app!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great so far! I've been playing with a variety of messaging apps and decided on this one. The super black mode is very welcome. I decided to pay the max donation to show support. The one thing I don't see is a way to send multiple pics at the same time. Other than that it checks all the boxes on my list of needs. Oh and I see the dev is actively responding to comments so that's awesome.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Colin Reimer,"I'm in love! As someone who is slowly trying to ditch Google services, I'm happy to report that this app is a wonderful alternative to Android Messages. The app interface is elegant and we'll thought out in terms of design. I would like to see a few gestures for reachablitly, possibly inspired by OneUI? It would make use on larger phones a dream. I'd also like it if I could swipe anywhere to the right to access the slide-out menu. It's location in the top corner is hard to reach.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Chuck Crombie,Today's update has made a mess of the app. Used to be great now it's lagging and crashing. Takes forever to open some conversations. Some don't open at all. Stock messaging app works fine. Installed the Google and Microsoft ones and they both work fine as well. Rebooted the phone and still the same issues. Don't know what you changed but change it back please.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've been pleased with the changes in the app. My scheduled messages send every time, on time. My messages hardly send multiple times now. The only thing I could think would be implementing a ""mute"" setting to mute certain conversations. Other than that, it's been my favorite messaging app so far.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"This app was nice until it stopped sending texts right when I sent them. It told me delivered but my friend didn't get them until the next day. It was the same in the opposite direction. She would send something and I wouldn't get them until later. We were so confused. Also, my family sent me a pic which I never received. I never had any of these problems with other apps. I do like that when I sent pics it was really quick. Unfortunately because of the lag in sending and receiving texts I'm having to Uninstall this app. Makes me sad.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Design looks decent enough especially with the night mode. My only gripe, which is a pretty big one to me, is that you can't send video directly through this app. Only links... Also having constant issues sending pictures. These two issues are negating the usefulness of this app. If a fix happens soon I will update my review, otherwise this app will get deleted and dropped to 1 star... Realising the latest issue with sending pictures has only recently started after I upgraded to Plus...",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"What happened to my sweet, emoji-free app? It did an automatic update and *poof*...it all went crazy. I cannot send group text messages anymore, and the texts I send often go to the TOP of the previous message instead of the usual bottom of the previous message. Or, when I press the send button, the message I sent just disappears, so I have no idea if it was actually sent or not. What happened? I have restarted my phone, twice. My 3 daughters have the same app and their's did not update.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Corey Lewis,"Easy to use but very laggy. The app takes four seconds from the time I hit send on a text until it appears on screen. Additionally, switching between chats is a painfully slow process, as it seems it has to reload the conversation from scratch each time. Archiving all but two chats didn't even help matters. This isn't usable on my Galaxy A01.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Schmonko The Clown,This had potential at one time. It really doesn't stop spam messages with Should I Answer. Also making it the default just doesn't work when sending attached photos. I finally had to uninstall this app as it can't do what it claims. And when sending attached photos I have to make Message+ the default. QKSMS was a great goal at one time - but it too was pretty much all bark and no bite.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I would give it five stars but when I first started using, I couldnt save contacts from this app. The latest update seems to have fixed that. However, with that fix/update seems there is a new bug that's not allowing me to send photos. I have force closed the app and restarted my phone, to no avail. Seems this started when the app updated a few days ago. Bummer. Looking for a new app as we have a newborn and sending photos is a must!",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Loving this app! I switched when the default messages app got rid of individual colors for each person's message bubbles and made my outgoing messages blue instead of grey (I like having incoming messages be colorful). I love the pure black dark mode since it's nice for OLED screens. Messages seem to send a lot quicker than the stock Android messages too and I don't get any failed to send notifications like I used to. One issue I am having is that my contacts don't update new numbers that text me even after I add them to my contacts, but otherwise things have been smooth.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I rarely write reviews, unless an app is exceptional. This is one of the best apps I've used, period. Smooth, fast, & clean. I also really appreciate the quick reply function & that there are no ads. I plan on upgrading as soon as I can afford to. This app says it will make you love texting again, and quite frankly, it's accurate. I used to avoid replying to people bc my previous texting apps were slow, clunky, & loaded with ads. Now I am able to keep in better contact with my family! Thank you!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Thus far this is a very good app. Though as a previous reviewer mentioned, I find the groups listed at the top of the recipient list rather than individuals when creating a new text to be a hassle. I do have quite a few groups defined in my contacts. So, a means to eliminate them from the list, or, even better, order them at the bottom of the list would be a big improvement to me.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,App seems to work well but it has a very Annoying Notification Issue. When you set the main Notification sound from the main settings it doesn't apply that sound to new messages so you have to go in and set each message thread to the desired notification sound.  Reply: Thanks for the quick reply however I fully understand how the custom sounds work and how to apply them the issue is when I set the main notification sound in the app all of the new messages I create default back to the default sound that was there when I downloaded the app (it pulls the default notification sound set on my phone that is used across all the other apps) If this is still not clear if you have an email I can send you some screenshots of the problem. PS I found your email so I will send you screenshots.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Andrew Paradiso,"Works surprisingly well for an app that's no longer maintained for over a year. It's clean, simple, and does what it needs to do. A small donation unlocks a few extra customizations. Thankfully it's open source, so anyone can continue where the developer left off if they wish.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Jeff Gunderson,Stable and full featured. Switched to after experiencing deteriorating stability with Google Messages and after having tried a few other options that turned out to lack pretty basic features. Best sms app I've tried. A couple minor things thst would be nice are 1) ability to search within a single conversation and 2) ability to view an attached photo before sending. But again minor things compared the superior operation compared to most other messaging apps.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"seems to be a very nice looking alternative to googles messages app. BUT I can't send GIFS at normal quality. They get really blurry and small for other people. Also something I'd love to see in the app is that in group chats, the individual contacts involved have different colors attached to them. Preferably the ones assignment in their individual chats. 😁😁",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I've always switched from messenger to messenger, trying to find the perfect one. This is it. It's just as clean as Google messages, as customizable as Textra, and as intuitive as the both of them. It's not overloaded with useless features either. This is a fast, pretty, and simple messenger, with nothing to dislike.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"-snip- Original review about pictures not sending which was solved - Update: just noticed the reply and tried the solution and it worked! Thanks. Update #2: I've had to revert back to another sms app as texts messages failed to send to certain phone numbers ""This message to *name* failed to send."" An odd problem but an important one.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Cristobal Rendon,"I've been using this app for a solid 3 months now and the experience hits all my needs. No sending errors, images look full when sent, well organized. I've definitely been convinced to pay for this. Based on my understanding, it only uses SMS and MMS, no RCS yet. It's not google and that is what matters to me. Works well with open board as an alternative to the stock Samsung keyboard and messaging app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Scott Biggs,"Some features are nice, but I only use a few of them. Compared to the built-in messaging app, this is a little clunky. But the biggest problem is the memory usage. This app hogs so much, that it squeezes out all other apps, making switching between frequently used apps impossible. For me, this is a deal breaker. Update: Seems they have considerably reduced the size of this app, so I'm upping my review to 4 stars. Thanks! Now if I could find some decent docs, I'd be completely happy.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,R P,"I liked QKSMS even with the bugs. I contacted the developer via email 5 times. Waited 4 weeks. NOT ONE REPLY. Nothing on the web for support either. It is obvious this app is no longer supported. This version in the Play Store is from February 24, 2021. Nothing new since. I uninstalled QKSMS and had to find something else for messaging. I could not continue to use QKSMS with the bugs, as they are too severe to live with. Fix the bugs and this app could be one of the most popular messaging apps available.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Ethan Shenfeld,"I love this app. I was looking for an ad-less and customizable messaging app and this has ticked all my boxes. The app offers a litnay for customizable colors, notification settings, messaging settings and a bunch of other things too. The app offers AMOLED black as the background too which is nice. The blocking feature is really nice and unique too. I am considering donating to the app development too. Would highly recommend. Only issue is sending photos larger than 11mb. Using on OnePlus 8.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like it so far, but the only drawback compared to Mood or the default is the lack of on screen notifications. Those apps have the bubble that can appear on your screen to let you know you have messages. Since this app doesn't have it, I tend to miss messages from people. Other than that it's pretty good.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,James Wadsley,"Was looking for a replacement for Textra, because even in 2021 they still can't archive text messages. I like this app so far, only wish you could customize more. Like increase the text font size in a text message without making the whole application text bigger, or customize the outgoing text message background, instead of a boring old grey. Emailed the developer, may update my review if / when he gets back to me",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the schedule message for later option! I haven't seen that since Chomps, i use this feature constantly for work!

Sold!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Larry Nevada,"I really like the app. But - I used it a week with no issues. Starting yesterday I cannot send an image. Nothing was changed, it just quit sending pics. I attach it and tap send and it just disappears as if I pressed a cancel button. No response to my request for help. I uninstalled & reinstalled with no change.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the clean UI and especially the widget. BUT, it frequently gets into a state where it won't allow me to 1. create a new conversation, or 2. pick an existing conversation. I'm on Moto G5S Plus, Android 8.1.0 and have no touchscreen issues other than with this app. Haven't been able to diagnose when this glitching starts occurring. (Update) It stops responding to my touches - I can see that the touch ""registers"" (because it momentarily flickers), but nothing happens.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Brad Bigam,"The app works really well. I don't know why but all of a sudden I'm getting Google microphone instead of the microphone that I used to get. Did that happen with the update? Cuz I hate Google microphone. It stops randomly and etcetera. I looked in settings to see if I could switch it, but I couldn't find anything.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Not only do I love the look of this app, but I love that I can customize my conversations with diffrent colours. I don't mind the slow updates, since it is 100% ad free. I cannot wait for the future ideas to be in updates. I like the way it is going. My only quip is I think it might have slowed my phone down slightly. At least, compared to the default message app on my phone. But I'm willing to settle on that for using this app.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Mr Leon (The Specialist),"I love the app , I am very happy with it .some suggestions for future development: a little tab to pull down in conversation, that has mini calender in it . So it can jump to that day . Maybe search box also in individual conversation ? Categories and trash would be nice also .great app Ps: almost forgot , only thing i dont like is . To.many options when inserting pictures .it shows all app .maybe have gallery as default would be better .having 3-4 is a bit much.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Chris Zolman,"Really great but has a weird glitch. When I start a text to someone from scratch that wasn't in my inbox before, it'll send the text but when they respond, it'll be in a different thread. Both threads have their name on it, so I have to switch to the one they replied on. And later when my inbox is full of other people, and I don't want to search for them, I'll start another text from scratch and it'll write in the first thread (which only has my initial texts. Not their responses) Very annoying",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"The interface is rather beautiful! I've been using for months. Much functional than the vanilla messaging app. It could be better by enhancing the spam blocking function. Currently it only supports blocking by number but it only covers US. If localized spam providers are not possible, maybe adding blocking by regrex of content is a shortcut.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Hanna May,"Overall a pretty good messaging app. Clean UI. I have difficulty with MMS messages. I've changed the setting for no compression, automatic compression, compression to 2mb, regardless of setting pictures don't send at times. Not sure the issue. Otherwise good messaging app.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Jeff Ruebel,"Intuitive, well-organized and attractive interface. Good features. I tried QKSMS because it opens URLs in texts in the browser of my choice (Messages forces them to open in the useless built-in browser) and I ended up finding it to be an all around better app than Messenger and several others I've tried.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Kado,"Nearly perfect messaging app to replace Android SMS and my default messager. The only issues I've had are backing out of the app and going back mid message, and the position I was previously typing in was moved to BEFORE my message, as well as messages/images not loading after sending a message and or backing out and backing in. Customization and colors are beautiful and the UI is easy and nice. Wish there was a text search feature like Android MS but hopefully devs have some expansion to do!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Houston,"Really enjoying this app so far. Aesthetics are super important to me and this app visually looks great! Reasonably customizable, especially in color settings. It's fast and responsive, and comes with all the features I care about. The only thing I miss from Pulse SMS is the desktop messaging capability. Otherwise, everything I want is here and works great! ZERO issues with MMS so far too! Photos send quickly and are somehow HIGHER quality than my prior app?! Using a Galaxy S10. 9.5/10 so far",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Well I can't complain...works with my call control pro license and it actually shows the pics on my Galaxy phone while the stupid stock app doesn't. Listen guys... great job so far. Keep up the good work. 👍 Update:. I have to come down on my review bc you guys really need to allow audio and video like the stock app on Samsung. I have to swap back and forth in order to do this.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I purchaed the upgrade to support development and for the delay sending option, as QKSMS does what it does well and shows potential. I rated the app 4 stars, because I was disappointed that the delay feature only works with SMS and does not work with MMS. With delay send on MMS, I would give 5 stars. On a positive note this is one of the few Play Store message apps that will send MMS from the OnePlus 6t on the Verizon network.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I absolutely love this app. I spent a long time looking for an sms app and was about to code one myself until I stumbled upon this. It's a very clean and beautiful UI and it does everything you expect from a texting app. The only reasons I'm giving this a 4 star is because I would like to see in-app media selection (along with videos being allowed) and maybe more group messaging settings like send individually to all and sms/mms toggles.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Loving the app and transitioning into making it my daily driver. Super appealing aesthetic and the dark modes are A1. Maybe in the future, link previews could be added as well as having favorite/starred contacts appear first for new messages /sharing. Also displaying recent photos when sharing a photo within a conversation would be a nice add. Great job overall 💪🏾",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Aislynn Dynna,"this app is great for messaging, super fast and simple. the customization options are minimalistic and satisfying. however, recently there was an update that put a time receipt above every new received message in the conversation. i don't really like this feature and otherwise i would have continued to use the app. if it would be possible to create a setting where one can choose whether or not to display a time receipt with every received message, i would definitely give this app 5 stars.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Darcy Moore,"I purchased this app as I liked its clean uncluttered interface, and I wanted to use its advanced features, such as scheduled messaging. It was disappointing, first, to find there was no repeat option for scheduled messaging and second, I later realised it was not sending scheduled messages at all. I made certain it had all the necessary privileges, and that I was only sending text messages. (Mms will only send when the data is switched on). This makes it unreliable, and rather less useful than many of its competitors.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like this app for its simplicity and reliability. One thing that bothers me is the text background in incoming messages in night mode. It's hard to read, at least to me... OK, I think I've found the reason. I set up a night mode and the theme was not dark enough, hence the incoming message background became brighter so the contrast between fonts and background was weaker. My mistske",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Pretty straightforward so far. I like the efficient design. Currently what I feel the app' lacks the most is the possibility to group all the notifications (like automatic/confirmation messages) in a single 'folder' because they can take quite a bit of space. Also adding the possibility to automatically delete them after X time (if read) for both security purpose and saving space.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Northwest,"I'm enjoying the simplicity of this ad-free app and the fact that it's open source but there are also some design features that I appreciate.

Disappointed to see that no option to choose the backup save location, it only uses emulated sdcard (internal storage), and defaults to a folder marked QKSMS.  Pretty pointless as this would be wiped during a factory reset, and offers zero benefit for those who have a physical sdcard slot. Much better would be the ability to choose a location, so the physical sdcard can be selected.",3

Aside from that this app has great customization, an excellent backup system and all the quick reply/mark as read tools I use. It does not support RCS but that is to be expected since Google is running that out of their own servers. BUT if you just need a great and transparent open source SMS app this is the one to use.

However it shows the message in the conversation before sending.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Padua Play,Glad to see an update. Still love the app. Worth paying for and did. But even the recent update 3.9.2 has performance issues. Hangs when typing + to compose a new sms and then any number or character - apparently the app hangs while looking up the contact database. This issue was already there in previous versions. The phone has about 2600 contacts and about 30 sms'. Even the stock Google Messages app does not hang! (just to compare). Request the developer to fix this ASAP. Thanks.,3

Unless you can personalise it like a few other apps so that you can have different signatures for different people then it is purposeless to most of us.

Now I can create my own ""OLED mode""(heavy use of true blacks) to not only not blind myself at night, but also for battery savings since true blacks actually turns off the portion of an OLED screen. A secondary concern was privacy/transparency - I've seen too many stories where closed-source applications mine your data and nefariously embed themselves deep into your phone's OS, and Google already has so much of my data. With QKSMS being ad-free and open-source, my messages are one less thing I have to worry about Google selling for advertisement. I've been a long-time user, and remember a lot of little bugs popping up, but upon reflection I haven't had a single issue with my newest phone (OnePlus 6), so development has come a long way too.

com.moez.QKSMS,Slumber Foxie,"I have known your app since 2016 but finally decided to use it and by God, it was disappointing,not what I known from others who used it. No read all messages option, no pinning of top messengers or messages (it's a feature of Google messages), and of the one that most disappointed me was of backup and restore option which is locked in premium. If I had known, I wouldn't used it. Premium should be icing, not the cake. Plus consider making an app for dialer, caller ID & contacts all in one. 👍",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Rob,"I've tried so many paid versions of SMS and I can only speak from my experience when I say QKSMS is perfect for me, has everything I need especially when it comes to scheduled text messages and pop notification on my screen for new messages as I wasn't getting with many others but could be my smartphone. The only thing I'm not sure as of yet if this has or diesi us end to end encryption which I don't believe it has and not a deal breaker, I do simple texting and it's perfect..Paid Version",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great for texting, but really frustrated when trying to attach it share pics. It almost never works. I'm looking for another app as it's so annoying and disappointing, because otherwise this app has a great set up and design and it's really clean and easy to use.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Dennis Wando,"An amazing, lightweight app that does what it ought to - texting - really well. The free version has virtually all I need. It has a sufficient number of customizations though not as in depth as other comparable apps. It doesn't bog you down though even with add-ons.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like the look and feel of it but I uninstalled it because I really depend on having 10 preset responses. On messages with three recipients it would help to have each recipient have a different color of text. I'll check again in a few months and reconsider installing it then.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Had an issue with pictures not sending but the recommendation for compression size selection worked! Thanks support team! Just a wish list of features: - timestamps displayed on all messages - check marks to denote delivery receipts and/or messages read - option for custom backgrounds - option to change appearence of text bubbles - more customization in general,4
com.moez.QKSMS,KMM Zaman,Something is good but there is no 'Mark all as read' option. For that we have to read all masseges one by one to mark all massege as read this is very annoying. Also there are much problem while i send a sms to dual or more number of a same contact. I have to send that type of message individualy to a person who have more than one number. Group massege does not sent individualy so that we cannot see delivery report in every masseges easily.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Lightweight and looks amazing too. Would love the option to toggle random colors for contacts but otherwise fantastic! Edit: Shows developer does listen to feedback. This feature has been added now and this is by far my most recommended sms app now. Free, open source, and just beautiful and gets the job done perfectly.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,De Mins,"Worked great for past 2 years on S9 ... Few months ago started having occasional lengthy transmission times with and sporadically not receiving incoming messages. Recently, the slow transmission issues started occurring almost constantly... We're talking about a simple ""OK"" reply... Yesterday, couldn't send messages at all, after hitting send, message would disappear from box and never delivered to recipient. Finally had to switch back to Samsung messenger app.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Jennifer Melo,would be nice to be able to change the colour of text bubble of sent messages when using either dark mode or light mode. Also having the option of sent sound for when messages send would be great. Would also like the option to mute certain messages. Lagging messages including mms by 5 days please fix. To be able to send over 2mb mms messages and for them to be clear.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Excellent app! I love that it's open source but also updated and managed very tightly. The app is clean and functional. Highlights include dark theme, scheduled message sending and backup options (the last two are for the paid version). Thank you!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Fast client. But can not send test that is 2 messages long. Like you type more than one message worth of text in one message it cannot break it up and send it in 2 it will fail.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"as others have mentioned I too am very impressed with the speed and cleanliness of the app. matching received bubbles to a chosen contact color. the one bug I have noticed is receiving a message from a contact that has been blacklisted, still populates the notification on the home screen icon. G7 Android 9.0 with MS launcher. edit... on single sms thread make the contact color with no picture match the bubble color,dont know why icon notification home scrn shows in blacklist contact ons launcher",4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"So far, so good. Clean and sleek design with great additional free features over most other SMS apps. I havent explored plus yet, but at least try the free version when thinking of switching to other SMS apps. The dev seems to be very communicative too which is fantastic.",5

App had recently updated and my bugs have been resolved and the problems all fixed!! Thank you so much I really am happy with the quick response - great app! Customizable and much better than standard messaging app on the phone,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Nowshad Ahmed,"The app is great in terms of looks and general usage. The best feature I like is the popup customisation, so I can delete unwanted sms as soon as it comes. And so 3 stars. As for the missIng 2 stars, the app doesn't seem to sync previous sms and doesn't show sms prior to using this app. Synching option doesn't do anything, rather clears the messages from this app. The messages are still available in default app but not shown here.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Doug Clark,"Call Control suggested QKSMS, and it's been pretty good. But something ""magical"" would be the ability to block email-to-text spams by domain. I emailed an inquiry about it, but never got a reply about if it's even possible on Android. I don't know anyone who would text me from any Hotmail address, and I'm tired of pornospams at 4:00 AM. Update: I'm reducing the rating to two stars because of the lack of response, and searching for a different messaging app.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Has almost every feature I want (archive, themes, scheduling). The only issue is often MMS images will fail. The app won't event attempt to send them, even if the compression limit is off. Only flaw, but it's a major one.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love love love this messenger app. Thin, light and has all the features that I need. The reason I started looking at messenger apps is because Verizon's messenger app was too huge and bulky for me to want to deal with. I found QKSMS several years ago and haven't looked back. When I have had problems, which is rare, emailing the support email gets a quick response and the developer is lovely. He can usually solve the issue in an email or two. Can't recommend this app highly enough. Perfect",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Samsung Galaxy S8, Pie 9.0.0 - QKSMS works great!  I really like this app as it is light on resources, has a simple well laid out interface, no ads and is open source.  Other SMS apps I tried felt bloated and over featured.  QKSMS is very fast and has the features that I need on a daily basis.  I used this app for less than an hour and then purchased the + version.  I did not need any of the + version features but I wanted to support the developer for building this nice app.  My thanks to the developer for a simple well laid out app that works great.  Job well done!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I love the app's clean interface and ease of use. I wished there are more customization options nonetheless, it's great! 😊 Edit: I would love to see the option of changing bubbles and the color of the bubbles (gradient, perhaps?)",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The best sms app out there. Simple and customizable. And the developer is very generous. There are no ads and none of the important features are restricted to premium. If I used it more than once every other month I would definitely pay the very reasonable one-off £2.59.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Mark Young,"I really like this app, however, I can't find a ""Mark all as Read"" function. It seems that if I have several messages to mark as read I need to long press the first one, and select each of the others before selecting ""Mark as Read"". If I am missing something I would like to know. This feature would be a welcomed addition. Otherwise, I am very happy with the app.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Good so far. Latest version improves message blocking and has helped keep the spammers down, just click block and you won't see the spammer again. I would seriously get at least 43 spams a day which made it difficult for me to tell good mesages from bad and it just takes a quick click and you're good to go. Love the QKSMS+features like Scheduled messages and Automatic night mode and my favorite is blocking so far and it's free. I'm already getting a better messaging experince.Try it for free.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,joel moore,Love the app and customization. 2 issues 1. Can't send video 2. Sometimes pictures will say they didn't not send but do send. Or if I try to send out a picture to a group of people it works correctly on their end but on mine I see multiple sent to one person and nothing to the others.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app, just need archive functionality for the notification action buttons. Also, the reply overlay is horrific on my screen it is far too small and the keyboard cuts off what you are typing. Perhaps do a full screen mode option for smaller devices.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Great app. However since Amdroid 10 was loaded no notification of texts appear on screen as they did before. Just notification icon in the tray. I like to have the text appear and be able to reply immediately. Hope it is put back in the next update.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I have used many sms apps but this one is just love. One can schedule its sms. Backup and restore is also available (on purchasing). Themes are also good. * Improvements* : There is room for improvement also. You should add coustom bubble colors and shapes in the conversation. Over all app is the best. 5/5,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Not bad, but it could be better. I like the uncluttered appearance, compared to the stock android 9 app. 5 STARS if you update with the following features: 1. Allow 'lock message' so that when a conversation is deleted the locked messages remain. 2. Ask to include the signature and 3. allow storage of several, different signatures. 4. Theme colour selected for a conversation should be applied to the inbox icon. 5. Allow conversions to be 'flagged' as important with an icon.",3

But Qksms wouldn't always receive messages from my contacts and never accepted texts from 2fa sources, unless my phone was awake and opened to the Qksms app. I could live with the latter but not the former, after missing key texts telling me about changes in plans. So my search for a non invasive texting program continues.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,revenant567,"I've paid for this app because I used to use it all the time and I wanted to support it, but for some reason, you can't text MMS videos anymore, you can only send SMS and MMS pictures. I only want one app for SMS/MMS, and this app can't do all basic funtions, and until it can again, my rating stays",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Does what I need better than the stock messaging app, especially like the ability to select multiple messages to delete within a conversation.

Recently I've noticed alot of sending lag and failing to send messages it's Not my phone company its the software. Reinstall fixed until backup was restored. Once restored diagnostics showed qksms database was larger that is set to allow. So either increase the size for everyone or make it a setting for qksms+. I have x2 sims each other there own messages dating back 2 to 3 years. 5 star tyvm,5

Why did this happened and how can i fix this? Now it doesn't show any count so i'm kinda curious. A little help? This is the best messaging app around. I've tried so many messaging apps that were so complicated to use, but QKSMS is the simpliest, practical and good looking. Kudos to the creator(s) of QKSMS. Will purchase the additional features soon.",5

Have even tweaked around with the MMS limit with no luck.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Dotdot.,By far the best texting app except for a recent problem I've been having where I can't send uncompressed MMS like everyone else says. You have to compress it down to a terrible quality in order to send. It says 'failed' repeatedly unless you do. Other apps like Textra can send uncompressed MMS perfectly fine.,2

I had to copy the text of the message to send it. I cannot long-press phone numbers to copy them in QKSMS. Also, QKSMS is missing all of the history with the number 7726. I hope it hasn't deleted anything. I have to use QKSMS now because I'm inundated with a dozen spam messages every day.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Really nice app. I was looking for an alternative for Android sms app and it's definitely worth a look. Two things that would make it perfect for me: adding option to hide the sim card toggle next to sms input, I never use the other cars actually and I already accidentally changed it. And the other one: an option to open an incoming msg in a modal window after you click on it from push notifications. Right now it opens the whole app, it only shows in the modal window if the screen is awake.",5

There are no obtrusive adds, nearly all the options you could want are free, but I'm excited for some of the future updates, particularly the auto-emoji button they'll eventually have as I use a keyboard without emojis and having to switch back and forth between my favored keyboard and the native one is a pain.",5

The group sms switch was off, it still sent out to all on my list, Not the contract I highlighted to be sent. The flaw in this app needs urgent attention quickly!.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,love this app and the continued development love the scheduling of messages and the theming options. love the all black mode and how smooth this app is. i love that it doesn't drain your battery much at all. love that it's open source. i would say the thing i want most is online messaging so i can text from my Mac. making conversations private with a passcode required to open them would be pretty amazing as well. thanks developer!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,LOVE this app for texting. Purchased premium in the first hour no joke. suggestion for future updates: adding a quick reply feature!

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"QKSMS+ is much improved from last decade – and far superior to my previous SMS app. It has all the necessary core features (except see below); has a beautiful UI; and is fast and reliable. However, it contains one deficiency – and it's a bad one. NO SUPPORT FOR MMS! You can send photos using MMS (but photos sent via MMS are shrunk to the size of a postage stamp); and the app is restricted to strictly allowing photos. This is preposterous. It needs to be fixed ASAP!",3

Thumbs up to the devs!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Igor Kevorkov,"Good sms client, the only downside for me is the delete button location.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This App is really Nice but somethings not right. Could you fix the landscape Mode with swift key it does.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Bought the premium version so that I could export SMS from my old phone. Again bought the premium version so I could import SMS in my new phone.

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"It's a very well designed and full of material goodness, but i just wanna say that could you move the info from the sidebar into settings because it makes the app look very odd Edit: i wish that you move the things that require pro in settings and also the banner to purchase pro, will make the app look more seamless",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Grebulon com,It's a nice an functional SMS app and I love that it's open source. Feature request: option to notify only on messages from contacts in the contact list and/or incoming numbers that are already received and were not blocked. This will reduce distraction from spam.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Kat Nolan,"I love QKSMS. It's a clean interface with the extras you want in an SMS app - themes and pin-to-top. And to get the full feature list for only $3 is fantastic. And NO ADS, even if you don't upgrade. Thank you!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,Tech 1on1,"Great messenger but decided to stay on stock .. paid to test premium features and was surprised that can't refund in 10 minutes, and all premium did was basically more theme options that was useful..

I through I'll get that buying premium.",2

com.moez.QKSMS,mcubed,"This is for sure a very reliable, well designed and thought out SMS app. This is the first app I paid for premium because it functions so much better than textra, mood, google messages, chomp and several others that I have used extensively which all had the same repetitive errors and none hold a candle to QKMS. It may not have fancy themes but the simplicity is honest and I like it a lot.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,PLEASE can you add the options to allow/disallow read receipts and typing notifications! That's all this app is missing. By default it's set to allow and people don't need to know if I'm typing and if I've read their message.......,4

com.moez.QKSMS,Concerned Human Man,I like the app. Two things missing. Muting the group messages. A big deal. And GIFs. Those two features are in Textra. Whats taking so long devs?? FYI. I had to uninstall this version and find the apk for a much older version so that attachments would send.,3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice App.. Keepup the good work.. A minor change in Copy Text option will help needs as It can only copy whole sms not its selective part..

I turn my phone off every night. Running android 9 on dual sim blackview 9900 phone. Not sure if i have disabled something i shouldn't have..? It is enabled as my sms app in the settings.

Please let me know what I'm doing wrong!?,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Smooth app but I have the full version and I'm still having issues sending out mms. The regular message app send out message and this can't. Also switching default app take too long. Once this mms issue is resolve it would be nice to be able to text videos.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My favorite messaging app! It does everything I need, from customization to scheduled messages, and the app is smooth as silk. Kudos to the developer for this beautiful and functional work of art!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,The screen doesn't wakeup for incoming messages. In the silent mode it is a trouble to get notified about incoming messages because of that. Please fix that problem to wakeup the screen. Good job anyway.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Linda Houston,Stopped sending images. I tried a file compression app and it still didn't work. I'm now using the message app that came installed on the phone with no issues.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"On S8 when old sms synced from stock app none of my own sent messages got transferred. Received sms ok. I paid full version, but I don't enjoy the app for this reason. Update: the issues still remains unresolved. Resync didn't help.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,William Houser,"Love this app. Love that it's proper GPL open source. The only reason I didn't give it four stars is that it doesn't as far as I can tell offer the ability to send a voice audio message which is a feature I really need because I drive for a living. Add that, and I'll be sorted for life.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Jon A,"Simple but great app. But, I hope to have the option to PIN or mark as FAVORITE some messages, so that they will be more easily accessible on top of the list, all the time. Then it will be more worth paying for. Thanks and great work!",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Works...it works great with Should I Answer to help filter spam and junk texts. But it does a terrible job with GIF images that most of us like to use for messaging. Makes them all big and fuzzy.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like the simplicity of this app, it is quite elegant. My only complaint is that in dark mode my own chat bubbles do not have a background or outline, they are just white text on the black theme.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Lőrinc Bethlenfalvy,"You should indicate in the description that backup/restore is a premium feature, I installed the app mainly for that. Actually, for least surprise I'd suggest you upload a menu screenshot of the free version so that the OKSMS+ labels are visible.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Bruce Carlson,"It is time to retire this app! The last time this app was updated was mid-January. Hundreds of bugs have been found and there is no answer from the developer. Call Control keeps pushing this app but IT DOESN'T WORK! IT DOESN'T BLOCK TEXTS! And it's full of bugs. We reported nearly a dozen and NOTHING! Others have reported theirs and NOTHING! Not even sure this developer still even exists! Call Control: Do your customers right! Quit recommending this and YOU block texts, please!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I like that it is open source. The scheduler is the most important feature for me. This app does not do emojis, which is a big drawback. If they added access to emojis, it would be 5 stars. On ads, ever - this is great!",4

com.moez.QKSMS,mccoolemomma,This won't block spam texts AT ALL!! I have it integrated with call control but still I'm being bothered all day long with spam. Why is it so hard to create a text blocking app. I have yet to find one that will actually work. I know people will pay a good price for one that will work. All these are doing is clogging up my phone!!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,ei,it looks really nice!!! and the messaging is fast!! its just a super simple sms app and it works great :) you can change the theme from normal to night mode to pure black and you can also change the accent colors,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Charles Jutkins,I mostly really love this app. The one little bug is sometimes a message cannot be deleted as it get's past QKsms and some how lands in the android messenger cache. I would delete messenger but it's one of those built in apps and even though it's and unlocked phone it won't let me delete messenger. The only way I can delete the messeage is to make messenger the default app then switch back to QKsms. Anybody got a solution? I am going to try of force stop on messenger for the time being and see if that works.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Dennis Bielefield,"So is pretty good in that you can block texts, but has issues sending while on WIFI and to groups. I've had to switch back to the default texting app a few times to send some texts.",3

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,It's ok. Sometimes it doesn't send emojis...it either doesn't send them at all or takes minutes for them to go through. Other texts will go through first even though I send them after the ones with the emojis in them.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Sheetza S,"ANOTHER DEVELOPER ABANDONED THEIR APPLICATION. If you are wondering why theres no support, it's because the developer abandoned this project .....with no warning, no nothing! I know it's a free app, a really great sms application. But in my opinion, the fact that the dev drops it, leaving so many users hanging is wrong. If happens so often. SMH",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Annie Minnick,Good for MMS and very long text messages. They aren't broken up like SMS. . But not good at all for sending pictures. They almost always fall to send even the lowest resolution.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Nice / and had just what I was looking for widget so I can have it on the main screen when texting makes it nicer when you're led doesn't work for all your messages and some cell phones that don't have the ID to tell you you had something or Miss hit this helps.,5

(Ms. Frankie),"Liked it at first very convenient that it blocked ask those spam text messages but then my after a few days my own contacts weren't getting messages I sent them and vis versa... changed settings, Uninstalled app twice and still has this bug so im uninstalling and I'll just put up with the spam text!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Really good app. Has a lot of useful features. I'm used to Textra and this is on par with that. The only things I miss are an option for a sent sound and chat color/style customizations.,4

com.moez.QKSMS,Ansley “Ans” Niles,"Impressive texting app but one major flaw, this app has a problem sending pictures to a recipient.. You have to try multiple times and it doesn't matter about using Mobile Data or Wifi either. This is what deters me from using the app.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I really like this texting app. I get all my messages without delays or issues like the factory app on my phone. There are no ads. I can customize it and I couldn't be happier.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Great app and I love it because it is open source. Is there any chance there will be a Linux desktop application for it? I am using Pulse right now, but I would gladly switch to QKSMS if this were to happen.

I will 100% subscribe to pro version soon. App is being made by a single developer and his work so far is impressive. Amazing job!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Yogavacara Siddhattha,It does support two SIM. 1. When any message arrives it doesn't show which sim have received it 2. It doesn't has one option like Silence sms app by showing two ticks that it doesn't show wether receivers has received message.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Glenn Grahl (Lil' Joker),Blocking is half and half Ability to search for keywords doesn't exist which is a feature most sms have (however not this app) although the ability to block text but not impede them coming in and being archived is great I feel this app has much to be discussed to make it a top notch user friendly application.,2

Such as ernest! I am not ernest and yet I get hundreds of texts for this person ALL FROM DIFFERENT NUMBERS THAT DONT EXIST! It's a form harassment and should be illegal!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I love the look and feel of this app. The inbox is so streamlined for simplicity and it has many features still in the works but everyone should give this app a good try.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Peter Buraczewski,"Hi I had loaded this app after having trouble on my other device, receive texts sms claiming bitcoin links to internet sites ,using random number generator and I had alot of money to collect before it's lost Tu keys ! I had should I answer , but they gave me free access too this one on my other device , ,which on this device I also apply I must pay approx $7,00 ? Well I think it's going tobe worth my effort to buy a subscription on this device also to get all them good colored features",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Robert S,It's a nice app and works well. The one thing that's missing that I wish it had was a notification telling me when I get a text while I'm talking on the phone . I wish they would add that. If it had that feature I would give it five stars,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Lina žinutė,Literally the same as another app named Messages with a yellow letter icon. So I'm not sure who's copying from who but at least in that other app all the features are free. And here you have to pay even for the night mode.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Melissa Smith,Only giving it one star because I had to to write the review. It's horrible when I finally got it to install. I tried getting ride of the adds and get the other fetures it accepted payment but nothing changed. I deleted it and was told I didn't get a refund even tho I never received what I paid for. Horrible. Don't use,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Rich Braverman,"When texting, unless your keyboard supports emojiis, you're outta. Also you can not attach a file to the text, yiu have go find it THEN share it with qksms. Fix those and it gets at least another star.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Kapil Jorwal,"One of the best FOSS SMS app out there but it still missing some basic features such as categories. It would be easier to differentiate SMS as Spam, Bank & Personal so that we can keep a record",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Group text spam is real. This app allowed blocking of all numbers in my recent group spam. The numbers were all random, no one I knew, so group blocking was what I needed. Glitz in an app is ok, but for me function rules. My phone is a Moto G6, and so far all works ok.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,John Mason,"Overall, this app meets or exceeds my text massaging requirements, with one glaring exception...it limits size of attached files...files that one has no problem sending easily in other messaging apps (e.g., F/B Messenger).",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Love the option to schedule messages but also silence specific conversation notifications. However, it does not work when I try to send a message to a group in Google Contacts that I have labeled.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,David Bond Engelhard,I like it better the Google app. Best texting app I've tried so far. Does anyone know of an app that has amazing spell check. I can't find one. It seems the iPhone algorithm for spelling is much better than Android but I hate Apple so an iPhone is out of the question.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Dont waste your money. if you want customizations with a ton of features textra is your app. this app used to have lots of customizations but now its a slimmed down version. The app works fine for your everyday kind of person. However, the creator now wants money. Dont pay more for less.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Mars,"This is an amazing app! From my experience, this one is the best one yet. Just one problem, it won't let me send gifs. Overall, very good app. Please fix that problem",4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Wish I could give it a 0 star rating. Totally useless! Messages are not being sent or often just disappear. Or they will show a sent status but the recipient never got themn. Today, I switch back to the stock app, all those messages no one got were there showing up as unsent. UNINSTALLED!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Raffaele Ziraldo,One of the very few SMS apps that allowes you to delete an SMS directly from notification! And overall fast and with quick access to basic operations. Well done!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Russ Nickel,Very clean and slick. Super excited for advanced blocking based on keywords. Right now blocking with call control is less than I hoped but still very nice app 😊,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Just got this as default app often says messages not sent when they have been. However, even after setting this to default I got the same error messages. Any idea developer? Cheers",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Ever since I bought my second phone & google hangouts was the default sms app I've been using this I'm on my fourth phone now & have been using this with the pro version since it released, nice ui with full customization. For those of you who love dark mode this is an app for you. 100% recommend.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,This app was a recommended app to manage larger text data from pictures. The program works fantastic and allows me to send the larger files I need to send. Great program and highly recommend.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"I really like the app. One problem though: should I start a conversation by sending the initial SMS, that very SMS couldn't be find anywhere, no delivery report also. Thank you, Moez, for your help and for your cohesive effort.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Sharon DeBerry,"Unable to send attachments such a pictures from my phone. Always received FAILED status. Unfortunately, I was forced to return to the SMS app that came on my Samsung phone.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Well, there are various issues at this time (Oct 2018) that mar the overall user experience. I appreciate one man mobile developing though, and Canadian too! 😎 I am sure you will get around to them. I will check back in a few months.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,Very lacking in UX. Widget us inconsistent and doesnt refresh well. Need to pay just to have options that other messaging apps offer for free (such as message backup),2
com.moez.QKSMS,H AlJayyed,"composing SMS shows list of groups and all their members, which causing too much scroll. swipe to ""read"" often gets stuck. no option to backup app settings/blocklist.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Jarkko Tuovinen,I have one problem. The widget does not follow theme settings. I like pure black dark mode which the main app can be set to. But the widget is always white.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,R C,"I can not find a way to allow short code messages. I do not want these blocked and it is causing a real PITA to verify things, reset passwords etc. Uninstalling...",2
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Considering QKSMS as an upgrade from stock messaging app. Sadly, transfer of existing messages do not accurately update all contacts or existing group discussions. Can't justify paying for something when free is better.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Kat Masterson,"STILL Can Not make QKSMS my default. Apx 5days.MESSAGES don'tSEND.NO VISIBLE SCREEN INFO. Got15 old messages today also. I STILL DONT HAVE ANY KIND OF ON-SCREEN emoji...To click start a text or read one..EVEN TRIED STOMP. IT WORKED ONE TIME.. BUT NO A SUCESSFUL SENT OR RECEIVE. M.SOFT hounded me to sign in to all their ""services"" That's low. But now Google wants to push new apps. This app wants no more newbees. Hit and run: one star",2
com.moez.QKSMS,T Cov,"It seems to do what other spam blockers I installed couldn't do. Finally! Some peace of mind. Thank you... New review, lowered my stars. Seemed to be working at the beginning. Now more spam getting threw. Doesn't seem to block or warn you",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Ksai Viswanath,"Automatic delete message option is not working on my mobile, I am depending on it. My mobile is android 12, Q Snapdragon 778g, 8gb ram, ufs 3.1. It even didn't work on my brother mobile iqoo 7. ☹️😖😭 I tried a lot all things, still 👎. (What! Shut, there is even no select all option for deleting messages.🤦🤦😬) Plz, solve this problems. & Then auto forwarding coming soon.🤔🤨🧐🤔?",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Erica Thomason,Very intuitive design but minimal so not to overwhelmed with a bunch of ads or extra bs you dont need. Really like the app!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,AHetaFan,Would be 5 stars if it wasn't letting in texts from unknown numbers not in my contacts while configured to use Should I answer for blocking. Calls from unknown numbers are being blocked by should I Answer but not all texts are. Some are getting through.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"My favorite sms apo! Nice customizable options, very good looking, messages send in a blink, premium themes are perfect, I love how you can choose the color to your exact taste perfectttt!",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I just download the app and paid for advanced features but I don't know how to configure it. When I receive a text message does the the app automatically offer me the option for blocking? How do I find the blacklist for texts?,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Og Oggilby,Terrible. Don't download this app it will find every blocked number every Spam number every deleted number and put it back into your menu awful awful awful,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Larry Tolman,"UNINSTALLED til support answers. Becoming more frequent. I send images a lot, when i hit send, nothing shows up on my side, yet they get it. Annoying!",1
com.moez.QKSMS,J W,So much better than others including stock offerings from you-know-who. Others could learn a great deal on how to deliver a great product from QKSMS. Thank you all @ QKSMS,4
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"ever since I installed this message app, I've not been able to receive a text message from anyone... this is really frustrating!! please fix this problem for the love of your users.",1

com.moez.QKSMS,Leke Ajidagba,"I love this app, but just like Textra, or Google Message, I wish this app has smart reply and web preview, this is only thing that I wish it has then it's complete. Looks like I would have to go back to Textra for now, would give it another try in the future.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,P,"I really like how you can customize the left swipe and right swipe actions. The app is working well for me, no problems at all.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,EDIT: changjng my review to 5 stars as my specific issue is a system related issue. Developer is incredibly active and very open to reaching to the community. Combined with and awesome app and one cannot ask for more. This is a great sms app and more festures will be added thanks to the committed developer. highly recommended!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I like the app it's practical and useful I just wanted to know how to get the messages to sync automatically from Android database without having to manually go into settings every time if I do not use QKSMS has my default text messaging app please advise thank you,3
com.moez.QKSMS,James Rybski,"The app runs ok with one major exception. ""Delayed Send"" doesn't work reliably. I sent a help request to the app's contact without success.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Sandysan46,"This is just great. Simple to use, but many options such as set contact bubble color and select your choice of incoming text tone.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,I've been using this app for months now. I was searching for a good sms app and after trying a few I decided to stick to this one. I'm amazed at how good this app was in terms of functionality. I would say it matches other paid sms app but this comes for free. Today I received an alert that the app was infected and had to be uninstalled. I was saddened by this I hope the infection would be removed soon! For now I'm giving it 4 stars.,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Richard Wilson,"Been using QKSMS for a few years now, and I have been using Should I Answer in conjunction for blocking. Those two make a winning team. I only have one wish, copy a portion of the text such as OTP, temporary password, street address, etc.",5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,QKSMS is and has always been since it started the best SMS app for Android. That's it! Friendly and responsive developers that have always supported my questions and continuing upgrade the app to make it better. 5 stars all the way⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Ted Tiefel,The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star is the ability to text from your computer. That would make my go to SMS App.,4
